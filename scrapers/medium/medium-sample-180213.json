{"posts": [{"text": "When the iPhone X launched, a lot of designers were put off about the screen shape. Those complaints have mostly died down, but I haven\u2019t seen much design-nerd talk about cool corner treatment details. Fortunately, deep nerd shit is my specialty. When you\u2019re starting a design like this, the obvious, and comically cheaper option is to make all corners square. Machines exist and/or are calibrated to make those screens, so keeping edges squared requires fewer manufacturing changes and less talent along the pathway to production. Everyone knows how to make a right angle\u200a\u2014\u200adesigners don\u2019t have to do math, engineers need fewer calculations, the people making the machine are clear on what to do. And yet, let\u2019s examine how crappy all-square corners would look: Once Apple knew they wanted to take advantage of new full-screen technology, that gave them the opportunity to alter screen shape because they would need to address the manufacturing process anyway. Presumably, the expense was mostly built in. Still, there were lots of ugly ways to do this: This is where they landed: Here\u2019s where the nerd part comes in, iPhone X rounded screen corners don\u2019t use the classic rounding method where you move in a straight line and then arc using a single quadrant of a circle. Instead, the math is a bit more complicated. Commonly called a squircle, the slope starts sooner, but is more gentle. The difference is real subtle, even in gif-form, but here we go: Apple has been doing this to the corners of laptops and iMacs for years, but this type of rounding didn\u2019t penetrate iOS until version 7. This shape has classically been difficult to achieve, because it wasn\u2019t available in 2D design editors, though that\u2019s starting to change. Read about it in more detail here. Now let\u2019s talk about the notch itself. The left and right sides have two rounded corners. Because of the curve falloff, one curve doesn\u2019t complete before the next one starts\u200a\u2014\u200athey blend seamlessly into each other. As a result, no tangent line on this edge actually hits a perfect vertical. iPhone X templates I\u2019ve seen out there don\u2019t 100 percent duplicate the official shape, probably because it was either too hard to make or they haven\u2019t noticed. This is why it\u2019s good practice to use official assets from Apple, found in the design resources section of the developer site for creating icons and mockups. Future iterations of this design will surely alter these sizes, so it will be interesting to compare how hardware sensor evolution impacts design shifts. Overall, these decisions seem minor, but from a design viewpoint they\u2019re fairly opinionated. Even when designers are willing to spend social capital to push these ideas, most organizations won\u2019t put resources behind them. One of the things I love about indie apps is their ability to be opinionated. It\u2019s nearly impossible to ship strong viewpoints from larger companies where there are fifty people in a room examining angles. So it\u2019s cool to see Apple still has the ability to take a strong stance in this way. Sweating thousands of minor details is what separates Apple from other companies. Their ability to do that is hard-won, but damn it\u2019s pretty to watch. Edited by Maggie Mason. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

It taught me that what they say is true: Awful conditions can bring out the best in people. It taught me that one can get used to almost anything, including a sensation of choking, and of impending death. It taught me to savor the simple pleasure of fresh air. Tear gas even taught me something about a subject I have studied for many years as an academic: social media. It was June 2013 and I was in the middle of the Gezi Park protests in Istanbul. After each volley of tear gas, protesters would pull out their phones and turn to social media to find out what was happening, or to report events themselves. Twitter had become the capillary structure of a movement without visible leaders, without institutional structure. Without even a name. I was there to study the upheaval, this digital-era rebellion. But my mind kept wandering. Just a few days earlier, the first of Edward Snowden\u2019s leaks had ricocheted around the world. We would soon learn a lot about the capabilities of the National Security Agency: that it can access data from the likes of Skype and Facebook; tap undersea cables and circumvent industry-agreed cryptography standards; hack into the connections that link giant data warehouses run by Google and Yahoo. And the agency, we would discover, used secret court orders to get the cooperation it required from industry giants\u2014and to silence industry rebels. This was not altogether a surprise; after all, the NSA\u2019s mission includes the collection of \u201csignals intelligence.\u201d But the scale of the surveillance was shocking. And it was only possible because Internet and telecommunication companies have for years been amassing as much data as they can on their customers. Snowden didn\u2019t just reveal specifics of what the NSA is doing\u2014he also exposed an alliance of surveillance made up of governments and Internet corporations. This alliance can monitor almost every click, and often does. (In fact, non-clicks are also scrutinized: Facebook tracks status updates that people start and then delete, so as to better understand why they decide not to post.) These clicks are increasingly linked to records of our offline lives. Commercial voter databases boast of knowing the IP, or Internet protocol, address of almost all U.S. voters. They can take data associated with this address and connect it with voting records, finances, purchases, criminal records, salary records, and other information. Why do we give them our data? For the same reason that prompted the protesters to pull out their phones amid a swirl of tear gas: digital channels are one of the easiest ways we have to talk to one another, and sometimes the only way. There are few things more powerful and rewarding than communicating with another person. It\u2019s not a coincidence that the harshest legal punishment short of the death penalty in modern states is solitary confinement. Humans are social animals; social interaction is at our core. Yet the more we connect to each other online, the more our actions become visible to governments and corporations. It feels like a loss of independence. But as I stood in Gezi Park, I saw how digital communication had become a form of organization. I saw it enable dissent, discord, and protest. Resistance and surveillance: The design of today\u2019s digital tools makes the two inseparable. And how to think about this is a real challenge. It\u2019s said that generals always fight the last war. If so, we\u2019re like those generals. Our understanding of the dangers of surveillance is filtered by our thinking about previous threats to our freedoms. But today\u2019s war is different. We\u2019re in a new kind of environment, one that requires a new kind of understanding.   THE WORLD SHAKES WITH PROTEST AFTER PROTEST. Tahrir. Occupy. Syntagma Square in Athens, the 15-M movement in Spain. Now Ukraine. And these are just the spectacular street protests. Movements come in other forms, and not all of them are for causes that one may like: Anonymous, anti-vaccination, Slow Food, Tea Party. The ability to find like-minded people, to draw strength from them, to counter dominant narratives\u2014these are things that make movements feasible. Just as happened in Gezi Park. It began in late May, as a small protest against what seemed like an unstoppable juggernaut: the successful but polarizing Justice and Development Party (AKP) government. Gezi is a relatively little-known park, but it\u2019s also the last bit of green in Istanbul\u2019s Taksim Square, the heart of the city\u2019s historic center for nightlife and art. Prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan imagined something else in its place: a replica of an Ottoman-era barracks\u2014a barracks had once stood on the site\u2014containing a shopping mall and upscale housing. For many, it was hard to imagine a worse scenario for this vibrant area than this mix of kitsch and rich. Erdogan\u2019s plan met with protests from local residents, including artists, young professionals, and the city\u2019s small but resilient LGBT community. The protests resonated. The AKP is generally well-liked; the economy has prospered under its stewardship, at least until recently, and it has rolled out many popular policies, including the expansion of welfare programs. In the most recent general elections, held in 2011, it was reelected for a third term with a comfortable majority. Yet the AKP has also eroded checks and balances by placing supporters in all branches of government. And its urban renewal projects, while bringing money to the economy, have often involved replacing the delicate, historic vitality of Istanbul with gigantic shopping malls and cookie-cutter high-rise housing. Worse, the contracts to build them have often been awarded to those who curried favor with the government. Very little of this has been discussed in mainstream Turkish media, partly because large conglomerates in Turkey have purchased television channels and newspapers, which they use to run sycophantic coverage of the government. The few big media outlets that dare run reports about corruption have been slapped with huge tax bills on the order of billions of dollars, which were then miraculously rescinded after coverage was blunted. Yet Turkey is an increasingly wired country. You can hardly find a young person without a cell phone in Istanbul, and more and more of those are smart phones that connect to the Internet. So when a few dozen protesters tried to stop the bulldozers uprooting the trees in Gezi, and were pushed back with pepper spray, and had their tents burned, people learned about it from social media, not television. Twitter isn\u2019t a traditional broadcast company; there\u2019s no editor-in-chief who can be bought or pressured. So when the hundreds more protesters showed up, and were met with police, tear gas, and water cannons, people learned about it again on social media. Soon the protest was an order of magnitude larger. There were tens of thousands of protesters, in the center of the most central square in Turkey\u2019s biggest city, fighting with the police. The resistance, coordinated solely through social media and word of mouth, had gotten so large and tumultuous that CNN International began to cover it live. At the exact same moment, CNN Turkey was broadcasting a documentary about penguins. Someone put two televisions side-by-side, one tuned to the penguins, the other to CNN International\u2019s live feed from Taksim, and took a photograph. It went viral, and penguins became the unlikely symbol of the uprising.   I WAS IN PHILADELPHIA WHEN the protests in Istanbul exploded, at a gathering called Data-Crunched Democracy, hosted by the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. It was supposed to be exciting, and a little contentious. But I\u2019m also a scholar of social movements and new technologies. I\u2019d visited Tahrir, the heart of the Egyptian uprising, and Zuccotti Square, the birthplace of the Occupy movement. And now new technology was helping to power protests in Istanbul, my hometown. The epicenter, Gezi Park, is just a few blocks from the hospital where I was born. So there I was, at a conference I had been looking forward to for months, sitting in the back row, tweeting about tear gas in Istanbul. A number of high-level staff from the data teams of the Obama and Romney campaigns were there, which meant that a lot of people who probably did not like me very much were in the room. A few months earlier, in an op-ed in the New York Times, I\u2019d argued that richer data for the campaigns could mean poorer democracy for the rest of us. Political campaigns now know an awful lot about American voters, and they will use that to tailor the messages we see\u2014to tell us the things we want to hear about their policies and politicians, while obscuring messages we may dislike. Of course, these tactics are as old as politics. But the digital era has brought new ways of implementing them. Pointing this out had earned me little love from the campaigns. The former data director on the Obama campaign, writing later in the Times, caricatured and then dismissed my concerns. He claimed that people thought he was \u201csifting through their garbage for discarded pages from their diaries\u201d\u2014a notion he described as a \u201cbunch of malarkey.\u201d He\u2019s right: Political campaigns don\u2019t rummage through trashcans. They don\u2019t have to. The information they want is online, and they most certainly sift through it. What we do know about their use of \u201cbig data\u201d\u2014the common shorthand for the massive amounts of data now available on everyone\u2014is worrisome. In 2012, again in the Times, reporter Charles Duhigg revealed that Target can often predict when a female customer is pregnant, often in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, and sometimes even before she has told anyone. This is valuable information, because childbirth is a time of big change, including changes in consumption patterns. It\u2019s an opportunity for brands to get a hook into you\u2014a hook that may last decades, as over-worked parents tend to return to the same brands out of habit. Duhigg recounted how one outraged father, upset at the pregnancy- and baby-related coupons Target had mailed to his teenage daughter, visited his local store and demanded to see the manager. He got an apology, but later apologized himself: His daughter, it turned out, was pregnant. By analyzing changes in her shopping\u2014which could be as subtle as changes in her choice in moisturizers, or the purchase of certain supplements\u2014Target had learned that she was expecting before he did. Personalized marketing is not new. But so much more can be done with the data now available to corporations and governments. In one recent study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers showed that mere knowledge of the things that a person has \u201cliked\u201d on Facebook can be used to build a highly accurate profile of the subject, including their \u201csexual orientation, ethnicity, religious and political views, personality traits, intelligence, happiness, use of addictive substances, parental separation, age, and gender.\u201d In a separate study, another group of researchers were able to infer reasonably reliable scores on certain traits\u2014psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism\u2014from Facebook status updates. A third team showed that social media data, when analyzed the right way, contains evidence of the onset of depression. Remember, these researchers did not ask the people they profiled a single question. It was all done by modeling. All they had to do was parse the crumbs of data that we drop during our online activities. And the studies that get published are likely the tip of the iceberg: The data is almost always proprietary, and the companies that hold it do not generally tell us what they do with it. When the time for my panel arrived, I highlighted a recent study in Nature on voting behavior. By altering a message designed to encourage people to vote so that it came with affirmation from a person\u2019s social network, rather than being impersonal, the researchers had shown that they could persuade more people to participate in an election. Combine such nudges with psychological profiles, drawn from our online data, and a political campaign could achieve a level of manipulation that exceeds that possible via blunt television adverts. How might they do it in practice? Consider that some people are prone to voting conservative when confronted with fearful scenarios. If your psychological profile puts you in that group, a campaign could send you a message that ignites your fears in just the right way. And for your neighbor who gets mad at scaremongering? To her, they\u2019ll present a commitment to a minor policy that the campaign knows she\u2019s interested in\u2014and make it sound like it\u2019s a major commitment. It\u2019s all individualized. It\u2019s all opaque. You don\u2019t see what she sees, and she doesn\u2019t see what you see. Given the small margins by which elections get decided\u2014a fact well understood by the political operatives who filled the room\u2014I argued that it was possible that minor adjustments to Facebook or Google\u2019s algorithms could tilt an election. During a break, I cornered the chief scientist on Obama\u2019s data analytics team, who in a previous job ran data analytics for supermarkets. I asked him if what he does now\u2014marketing politicians the way grocery stores market products on their shelves\u2014ever worried him. It\u2019s not about Obama or Romney, I said. This technology won\u2019t always be used by your team. In the long run, the advantage will go to the highest bidder, the richer campaign. He shrugged, and retreated to the most common clich\u00e9 used to deflect the impact of technology: \u201cIt\u2019s just a tool,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can use it for good; you can use it for bad.\u201d (The scientist says he does not recall the conversation.) \u201cIt\u2019s just a tool.\u201d I had heard this many times before. It contains a modicum of truth, but buries technology\u2019s impacts on our lives, which are never neutral. Often, I asked the person who said it if they thought nuclear weapons were \u201cjust a tool.\u201d Humans have always fought, but few would say it doesn\u2019t matter if we fight with sticks, knives, guns, or nuclear weapons. This time, I sighed and let it go. I wanted to get back to Twitter. I wanted to get back to my hometown.   I ARRIVED IN ISTANBUL A FEW DAYS LATER. I went down to Gezi, and soon heard local residents describe how they challenged Erdogan\u2019s plans for the park through legal means. They faced a bureaucratic labyrinth Kafka would have been proud to have imagined. Requests to see the plans would disappear from government records. Officials who appeared too friendly to the requests would be reassigned. The residents filed petitions\u2014and watched them disappear. They couldn\u2019t even find out what exactly was being built, even though the land was publicly owned and subject to historic preservation laws. Many told me that the reality gap between television and Twitter had brought them to Gezi. \u201cI knew there was censorship on TV,\u201d one told me. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t until Twitter came along I realized how bad it was. It\u2019s one thing to be insulted discreetly, and another to be insulted so brazenly. I had to come here.\u201d I asked them what they were thinking of doing now they were in the park. Many didn\u2019t know. At first, they just wanted to show up. They needed to see, to close the cognitive dissonance between their social media stream and their television. Person after person told me how thankful they were for the Internet. Parents swore that they were going to apologize to their children, whom they had derided for spending too much time in front of screens. \u201cThey were right and we were wrong,\u201d one woman told me. \u201cWe didn\u2019t understand our kids. None of this would be possible without the Internet. The Internet brings freedom.\u201d IT WAS A STRIKINGLY DIFFERENT NARRATIVE to the one coursing through the country I had just left. As revelations about the scale of NSA surveillance flowed, sales of Nineteen Eighty-Four, Orwell\u2019s dystopian novel, shot up 6,000 percent on Amazon. Many came to see Oceania, the novel\u2019s massive, fearsome surveillance state, as the model of the modern digitally-empowered state. Nineteen Eighty-Four had finally arrived, it was said\u2014just off by 30 years or so. But this is the wrong way to understand what\u2019s happening. Deep and pervasive surveillance is real. It is likely worse than what we know, and is becoming more pervasive by the day. But Nineteen Eighty-Four has very little to do with it. Others turned to a different metaphor: the Panopticon, a thought experiment invented by the 18th-century social reformer Jeremy Bentham and later popularized by the French philosopher Michel Foucault. Bentham imagined a prison with a tall tower at its center, located so that guards in the tower can peer into each prisoner\u2019s cell. The gaze of the guards\u2014all-seeing, but invisible to inmates\u2014would make prisoners internalize the discipline of the prison, Bentham thought. Foucault later extended the idea by adopting it as a metaphor for the impact of surveillance on society. But that\u2019s also wrong. The Panopticon has little to do with most surveillance in liberal democracies. And these metaphors aren\u2019t just wrong\u2014they can be profoundly misleading. In Nineteen Eighty-Four, the anti-hero, Winston Smith, lives under bleak conditions. Everything is gray. He eats stale dark bread. Informers and the cameras are everywhere. Sex is banned. Children spy on their parents. If a citizen defies Oceania\u2019s harsh rules, a cage of rats is placed around his face. This imagined future is an allegory for a fear-driven state, one inspired by Orwell\u2019s views on Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Nineteen Eighty-Four is about surveillance in a society where the power of the state bears down on everyone, every day. In other words, it is about totalitarianism. The Panopticon is a thought experiment: a model prison meant to control a society of prisoners. But we are not prisoners. We are not shackled in cells, with no rights and no say in governance. In our world, pleasure is not banned; it is encouraged and celebrated, albeit subsumed under the banner of consumption. Most of us do not live in fear of the state as we go about our daily lives. (There are notable exceptions: for example, poor communities of color and immigrants who suffer under \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d and \u201cshow your papers\u201d laws.) To make sense of the surveillance states that we live in, we need to do better than allegories and thought experiments, especially those that derive from a very different system of control. We need to consider how the power of surveillance is being imagined and used, right now, by governments and corporations.   GEZI PARK WAS A PLACE OF BOTH resistance and celebration. It had the bursting vibrancy of a wildcat strike and the deep human solidarity that springs up after disasters. One afternoon, as I chatted with a group of young people, an old lady dressed in traditional Islamic garb approached us. She burst into tears. \u201cThey are gassing young people. I can\u2019t stand the idea,\u201d she sobbed. A young woman dressed in shorts and sneakers, and sporting a nose-ring and tattoos, jumped up to comfort her. Soon after, a middle-aged woman offered me some b\u00f6rek, a Turkish pastry. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about how to protest, but these kids do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I know how to bake.\u201d A little later, as night began to fall, I interviewed a group of young people who had hung up signs condemning media censorship. The messages had been translated into two dozen languages. The arrival of darkness increased the likelihood of police intervention, prompting one young woman to take out a marker and write her blood type on her arm. \u201cAre you this determined?\u201d I asked. \u201cWe are a rainbow here and [Erdogan] is trying to paint us all black,\u201d she replied. \u201cWe are a rainbow. We are not giving up.\u201d Gezi Park was indeed like a rainbow. I missed the whirling dervish in a flowing pink skirt (and gas mask), but caught the drum circles (with gas masks and helmets). Soccer fans came in large numbers. So did gays and lesbians, and they were more respected than I\u2019d previously seen in Turkey. The LGBT community even got the boisterous, macho soccer fans to stop using \u201cfag\u201d as an insult\u2014as is the standard in soccer slogans in Turkey\u2014and chant \u201csexist Erdogan\u201d instead. Devout Muslims distributed food to celebrate the Prophet\u2019s birth; feminists handed out stickers reading \u201cMy body, my decisions.\u201d I even saw a Kurdish group line-dance around a bonfire, watched by a man draped in the Turkish flag who sometimes tapped his foot with the rhythm\u2014a scene I could not have imagined before arriving in Gezi, given Turkey\u2019s tense ethnic relations. They were united in resistance to what they saw as growing AKP authoritarianism, and deliberate in fostering an aura of pluralism. The unity held most of the time. That\u2019s what can happen when people realize they are not alone. That\u2019s what a street protest does, in its essence: It makes you feel not alone. We should leave aside the stale arguments about protests that happen on the street versus those that take place online. There\u2019s one key feature that the Internet and the street share: They make us visible to each other. That is their power. In fact, the Internet\u2019s ability to break down \u201cpluralistic ignorance\u201d\u2014the erroneous notion that your beliefs place you in a minority, when in fact most people feel similarly\u2014is perhaps its greatest contribution to social movements. Facebook \u201clikes\u201d are often ridiculed as meaningless, but they can make a person realize that their social network feels the same as they do\u2014and that\u2019s a socially and politically powerful thing.   ONE LEARNS TO BE TEAR-GASSED. You tell yourself to keep calm as you head towards fresh air. It helps to remember that the gas probably won\u2019t kill you. Of course, the canister itself could hit your head or a crucial internal organ, and that could kill you. But I was wearing a bike helmet. Most of the demonstrators around me were wearing yellow construction hats, sold to them by Turkey\u2019s mostly Roma street peddlers. (From day one, the peddlers also offered spray paint, goggles, and other protesting essentials. Does anyone else in the world have better just-in-time stock management than dirt-poor street peddlers?) The only thing in short supply was a proper gas mask; they had immediately sold out in Istanbul, and the peddlers only had flimsy \u201csurgical\u201d masks of the kind that doctors wear on television shows. Those are of no use against tear gas. People who breathed in too much of the gas would vomit or fall to the ground, doubled up in pain. Protesters from the medical contingent would rush in, armed with makeshift stretchers, some made from old doors. Most of the wounded recovered. Some were sent to hospital. A few\u2014those hit in the head by the gas canisters, especially\u2014died. The protesters became tear gas connoisseurs: They could take one look at a canister and tell you what it was, what it did, and who made it. \u201cThis one, it\u2019s the worst, it always makes you vomit,\u201d a protester told me as he pointed to one canister among the dozen he had lined up outside his tent. There were constant discussions about remedies. Vinegar and lemon, commonly believed to be effective against tear gas, were disregarded in favor of a mixture of antacids and water. I believed them, because this was an educated, well-organized group that included chemists and doctors. (One example that was related to me: When the ammunition from another crowd-control weapon\u2014water cannons\u2014began to burn on contact, the protesters sent samples to a lab, which discovered that the government had added pepper spray to the water. Months later, a government spokesperson acknowledged this.) After the horrific pain in our lungs, eyes, and throats subsided somewhat, we would pull out our phones and hit Twitter. This wasn\u2019t vanity, or some desperate way to inform friends that we were okay\u2014though letting people know we were alright was often a big part of it. In the middle of Gezi one had little to no idea of what was going on elsewhere, even at the other end of the park. Social media was a lifeline, and Twitter got the most use thanks the service\u2019s phone-friendly simplicity and short message length. Crucially, Twitter relationships can also run one-way; I can follow you without you needing to follow me. As a result, users can interact with a large number of people, rather than just the smaller number of people willing to \u201cfriend\u201d them. Before I arrived in Gezi, I curated some tweets from the park and elsewhere in Turkey. Now I was spending my time listening and observing, and I found myself relatively clueless. I didn\u2019t have the bird\u2019s-eye view that comes from continuously following an event on Twitter. Friends from abroad would tweet questions\u2014\u201cWhat do you think of Prime Minister Erdogan\u2019s latest statement?\u201d\u2014and I\u2019d have no response. \u201cI\u2019m in the park, not on Twitter,\u201d I\u2019d reply. So we got on Twitter when we could. Connectivity was generally good, perhaps because major phone companies stationed repeater vans in nearby streets. Twitter was a way to check whether the latest tear gas canister was a lone strike, or the start of an operation to clear the park. Were armored vehicles heading our way? Where was the governor? Was the political situation deteriorating or was there a move towards negotiations? The news, the conversations, the pictures, the recipes for neutralizing tear gas, the calls for donations, word of celebrities visiting Gezi Park\u2014social media pulsed with these things. It was in the fabric of Gezi. None of this means that there is less surveillance in Turkey than in the United States or Europe. In fact, there\u2019s probably more. During its first years in power, the AKP replaced dusty ledgers with databases. Every citizen is now assigned a national ID number, which provides access to a government website documenting almost every interaction with the state, from property records to taxes. For many, it\u2019s a relief to have escaped the country\u2019s old bureaucratic systems. But the databases also enable massive surveillance. Citizens of Turkey need an ID number to buy a phone SIM card, for example, or to make a doctor\u2019s appointment through the public health system. Journalists, politicians, and pretty much all prominent people believe that the government goes further, and taps their phones as well. (Cartoonists often draw the state as a giant ear.) In fact, many protesters speculated that the government had not only allowed the Internet to stay up, but encouraged it. Those repeater vans may have been vacuuming up the ID numbers of the protesters. Somewhere in the government\u2019s digital archives, there is likely a list of every Turkish citizen who visited the park during the protests. Yet rebellion triumphed in Gezi, at least in the short term. The protests were eventually dispersed, but a court later ruled that the project violated rules about historic conservation. And the rebellion triumphed in another sense: People in Turkey started talking politics again, and social media became a highly charged and political sphere. The Gezi protests shook the image of AKP as unbeatable. Perhaps emboldened by the newfound spirit of challenge, other taboos unraveled. In December 2013, a corruption scandal, mixed with infighting among factions formerly allied with the government, rocked the country. Most of the news related to the scandal, once again, primarily circulated on social media as the government attempted to quash the investigation. Not surprisingly, the government has been pushing back. Earlier this month, parliament passed an Internet censorship and surveillance law that makes it easy for government to shut down websites without judicial oversight. Internet providers are also compelled by the law to collect all traffic information on their users, and to turn it over to the authorities upon request.   AFTER THE ARAB SPRING I was asked the same question over and over again: Is the internet good or bad? It\u2019s both, I kept saying. At the same time. In complex, new configurations. But the \u201cbad\u201d isn\u2019t a watered-down version of Oceania or the Panopticon, at least not in modern democracies. In an era in which the ideas of citizenship and rights have taken deep roots, coercion based on violence is of limited use. Coercion alone can\u2019t compel people to do the things modern states and corporations need us to do to keep the system going: to vote for their parties, to consume their products, to work in their corporations. To understand the actual\u2014and truly disturbing\u2014power of surveillance, it\u2019s better to turn to a thinker who knows about real prisons: the Italian writer, politician, and philosopher Antonio Gramsci, who was jailed by Mussolini and did most of his work while locked up. Gramsci understood that the most powerful means of control available to a modern capitalist state is not coercion or imprisonment, but the ability to shape the world of ideas. The essence of some of Gramsci\u2019s arguments can be seen in another great dystopian novel of the 20th century. In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley envisions a state that eschews existential terror in favor of a drug, soma, that keeps its citizens happy and pliant. Shaping ideas is, of course, easier said than done. Bombarding people with ads only works to a degree. No one likes being told what to think. We grow resistant to methods of persuasion that we see through\u2014just think of ads of yesteryear, and of how corny they feel. They worked in their day, but we\u2019re alert to them now. Besides, blanket coverage isn\u2019t easy to achieve in today\u2019s fragmented media landscape. How many channels can one company advertise on? And we now fast-forward through television commercials, anyway. Even if it were possible to catch us through mass media, messages that work for one person often fail to convince others. Big-data surveillance is dangerous exactly because it provides solutions to these problems. Individually tailored, subtle messages are less likely to produce a cynical reaction. Especially so if the data collection that makes these messages possible is unseen. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not only the NSA that goes to great lengths to keep its surveillance hidden. Most Internet firms also try to monitor us surreptitiously. Their user agreements, which we all must \u201csign\u201d before using their services, are full of small-font legalese. We roll our eyes and hand over our rights with a click. Likewise, political campaigns do not let citizens know what data they have on them, nor how they use that data. Commercial databases sometimes allow you to access your own records. But they make it difficult, and since you don\u2019t have much right to control what they do with your data, it\u2019s often pointless. This is why the state-of-the-art method for shaping ideas is not to coerce overtly but to seduce covertly, from a foundation of knowledge. These methods don\u2019t produce a crude ad\u2014they create an environment that nudges you imperceptibly. Last year, an article in Adweek noted that women feel less attractive on Mondays, and that this might be the best time to advertise make-up to them. \u201cWomen also listed feeling lonely, fat and depressed as sources of beauty vulnerability,\u201d the article added. So why stop with Mondays? Big data analytics can identify exactly which women feel lonely or fat or depressed. Why not focus on them? And why stop at using known \u201cbeauty vulnerabilities\u201d? It\u2019s only a short jump from identifying vulnerabilities to figuring out how to create them. The actual selling of the make-up may be the tip of the iceberg. Companies want to use this power to make us buy products. For political parties, the aim is to attract support based on a tailored presentation of that party\u2019s politicians and policies. Both want us to click, willingly, on a choice that has been engineered for us. Diplomats call this soft power. It may be soft but it\u2019s not weak. It doesn\u2019t generate resistance, as totalitarianism does, so it\u2019s actually stronger. Internet technology lets us peel away layers of divisions and distractions and interact with one another, human to human. At the same time, the powerful are looking at those very interactions, and using them to figure out how to make us more compliant. That\u2019s why surveillance, in the service of seduction, may turn out to be more powerful and scary than the nightmares of Nineteen Eighty-Four. Yet here we are, still talking to each other.

In other words, the ability to hide virtual objects behind real things. This post is about why occlusion in AR is so hard and why deep learning might be the key to solving it in the future. When you look at a purely real or a purely virtual world, you tend to accept the \u201crules\u201d of that world or suspend disbelief, as long as it satisfies some basic notions of reality like gravity, lighting, shadows etc. You\u2019ll notice when these rules are broken because it\u2019s jarring and feels like something \u201cdoesn\u2019t look right\u201d. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so instinctual to cringe at bad special effects in movies. In VR, it\u2019s actually quite easy to achieve suspension of disbelief because you have complete control over all elements in the scene. Unfortunately, as an AR developer, you don\u2019t have this luxury because most of your app\u2019s screen real estate (i.e. the real world) is totally out of your control. In the mobile world, Apple\u2019s ARKit has achieved incredibly fast motion tracking as well as realistic lighting and shadows, but it\u2019s still lacking when it comes to occlusion. Does the screenshot below look strange to you? It\u2019s because the dragon looks like it\u2019s further away from the chair but still appears in front of the chair. This isn\u2019t just a problem with mobile AR. It\u2019s also a problem on every headset available today. The goal of occlusion is to preserve the rules of line-of-sight when creating AR scenes. That means any virtual object that is behind a real object, should be \u201coccluded\u201d or hidden behind that real object. So how is this done in AR\u00a0? Basically, we selectively prevent parts of the virtual scene from rendering on the screen based some knowledge of the 3D structure of the real world. Assuming you have a good reconstruction of all the objects in your real environment, occlusion involves simply rendering that model as a transparent mask in your scene. That\u2019s the easy part. It\u2019s getting to that point where things start to get unwieldy. Consider a common street scene. There are people, vehicles, trees and all kinds of objects at various distances from you. Further away, there are larger structures like bridges and buildings, each with their own unique features. The hardest thing about creating a realistic occlusion mask is actually reconstructing a good enough model of the real world to apply that mask. That\u2019s because no AR device available today has the ability to perceive its environment precisely or quickly enough for realistic occlusion. Sensing 3D structure really boils down to one important ability\u200a\u2014\u200adepth sensing. Depth sensors come in many flavors, the common ones being Structured Light, Time of Flight and Stereo Cameras. In terms of hardware, Structured light and Time of Flight involve an Infrared projector and sensor pair, while Stereo requires two cameras at a fixed distance from each other, pointing in the same direction. At a high level, here\u2019s how they work: Structured Light sensing works by projecting an IR light pattern onto a 3D surface and using the distortions to reconstruct surface contours. This sensor works by emitting rapid pulses of IR light that are reflected by objects in its field of view. The delay in the reflected light is used by an image sensor to calculate the depth at each pixel. Stereo cameras simulate human binocular vision by measuring the displacement of pixels between the two cameras placed a fixed distance apart and use that to triangulate distances to points in the scene. Of course, all these sensors have their limitations. IR based sensors like have a harder time functioning outdoors because bright sunlight (lots of IR) can wash out or add noise to the measurements. Stereo cameras have no problems working outdoors and consume less power, but they work best in well-lit areas with a lot of features and stark contrast. Since all these sensors work on pixel-based measurements, any noise or error in the measurements creates holes in the depth image. Also, at the size and capacity of phones and headset devices today, the maximum range achieved so far has been about 3\u20134 meters. The image below is an example of a depth map created with a stereo camera. The colors represent distance from the camera. See how the measurements are good at a close range while further objects are too noisy or ignored? 3D perception doesn\u2019t end at depth sensing. The next step is to take the 2D depth image and turn it into a 3D point cloud model where each pixel in the depth image gets a 3D position relative to the camera. Next, all the camera relative point clouds are fused with an estimate of camera motion to create a 3D point cloud map of the world around the sensor. The video below illustrates the complete point cloud mapping process. Now that you understand the complete pipeline of 3D perception, let\u2019s look at how this translates to implementing occlusion. There\u2019s a few ways 3D depth information can be used to occlude virtual objects. Directly use the 2D depth map coming in from the sensor. In this method, we align the camera image and the depth map and hide parts of the scene that should be behind any pixels of the depth map. This method doesn\u2019t really need a full 3D reconstruction since it just uses the depth image. This makes it faster but has a few problems: The video below is an example of depth map based occlusion. Notice the irregularities in the Occlusion mask as the red cube is moved around. Re-construct and use the 3D point cloud model. Since the point cloud is a geometrically accurate map of the real world, we can use it to create an occlusion mask. Note that a point cloud itself isn\u2019t sufficient for occlusion, but point clouds can be processed to create meshes that essentially fit a surface onto the point map (like a blanket covering your 3D point cloud). This mesh can now be used to create the transparent mask we need to occlude virtual elements in our scene. Well that sounds like we have a good enough solution for Occlusion! So what\u2019s the problem? The 3 AR devices that I think have the most impressive tracking and mapping capabilities today are Google Tango, Microsoft Hololens, and Apple iPhone X. Here\u2019s how their sensors stack up against each other. Google Tango (Discontinued by Google)Depth Sensor\u200a\u2014\u200aIR time-of-flightRange\u200a\u2014\u200a4m Microsoft HololensDepth Sensor\u200a\u2014\u200aIR time-of-flightRange\u200a\u2014\u200a4m Apple iPhone XForward facing depth sensor\u200a\u2014\u200aIR Structured lightBack facing depth sensor\u200a\u2014\u200aStereo CamerasRange\u200a\u2014\u200a4m The main problem with all the above systems is that in terms of depth sensing, they have: So how does a developer today hack together a reasonable solution to get around these issues? Perfect occlusion is an elusive target, but we can get close to it in some situations, especially when we can relax the real-time constraint. If the application allows pre-mapping the environment, it\u2019s possible to use a pre-built mesh as an occlusion mask for the larger prominent objects in the scene, provided they don\u2019t move. This means that you\u2019re not limited to the 4m range of the depth sensor, at least for occlusion behind static objects. Moving objects are still a problem and the only solution right now it to use the depth map masking method for close range moving objects like your hands. Now it\u2019s clear from the example mesh above that a big problem with pre-built meshes is that although they\u2019re lighter than point clouds, they can cause more than a ten-fold increase in the complexity of your 3D content. At Placenote, we\u2019ve built guided tours of large museums in AR and the way we hacked occlusion was to manually draw planes to cover specific walls in the space that might get in the way of our virtual content. Of course, this method assumes that either the developer or the user will take the time to map the environment before the AR session. Since this might be a bit overwhelming for the average user, it likely works best in location-based AR experiences where the map can be pre-built by the developer. In an extreme scenario, you might want to occlude an AR experience at a much larger scale, like rendering a dinosaur walking among buildings in New York City. Perhaps, the way to do this is to use known 3D models of buildings from services like Google Maps or Mapbox to create occlusion surfaces at the city scale. Our friends at Sturfee have built a unique way of creating city scale augmented reality experiences, using satellite imagery to reconstruct large buildings and static structures in 3D. Sheng Huang at Sturfee has written about their platform here. Of course, this means you need to be able to accurately localize the device in 3D, which is quite challenging at that scale. GPS position is simply not good enough for occlusion since it\u2019s slow (1Hz) and highly inaccurate (measurement error of 5\u201320 meters). In fact, centimeter-level position tracking indoors and outdoors is a critical component of occlusion and through our work with Placenote, we\u2019re working towards a cloud-based visual positioning system that can solve some of these problems. While pre-built meshes are great for AR experiences tied to a single location, occluding moving objects still requires instant depth measurements at a range greater than just 4m. Improvements in sensing hardware can certainly help squeeze greater resolution and range from IR or Stereo sensors, but these improvements will likely hit a ceiling and produce diminishing returns in the near future. Interestingly, an alternative approach has emerged in 3D sensing research, that turns this hardware problem into a software problem by leveraging deep learning to improve the speed and quality of 3D reconstruction. This method uses neural networks that can pick out visual cues in the scene to estimate 3D structure, much like the way we as humans estimate distance. (i.e. guessing distance by using our general knowledge of the sizes of things in the real world. The networks are trained on a large dataset of images and are capable of segmenting out objects in a scene and then recognizing them to estimate depth. That means, if we can design the neural networks and train them on a good enough dataset, we might be able to bypass a lot of limitations in resolution and range present in current depth sensing technologies, with no added hardware costs. The image above is from a paper that explores methods to segment and label scenes using neural networks in combination with depth sensors to improve the quality of generated maps. You can find the full text of the paper here. If you\u2019re a new AR developer looking to build compelling AR experiences, don\u2019t let occlusion stop you. Remember Pokemon Go?

When recalling memories, we generally focus on 3 key components of moments: It\u2019s not surprising that these are the memories that stick out the most. What is surprising, according to Chip and Dan Heath, is that very few people INVEST in such moments. Most people reactively let the most powerful experiences happen. Few people continuously create those experiences. The average person experiences almost all of their \u201cpeak\u201d experiences in their teens and 20\u2019s. These experiences taper-off in most people\u2019s 30\u2019s and are basically non-existent as a person gets older and older. According to Dr. Abraham Maslow, peak experiences are necessary to becoming self-actualized\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is where you\u2019ve fully developed as a person and can pursue your highest potential. Most people plateau at a certain stage of their development. They stop dealing with the highs, lows, and transitions of growth. Instead, they seek the safety of stability. This safety shields them from the risks, pain, and seeking that is required for growth. Growth isn\u2019t supposed to feel good in the moment. Confidence and dopamine are not the same thing. In today\u2019s fast-paced and every-changing environment, the norm for most people is to seek short-term dopamine highs, followed by long-term internal conflict and regret. The reverse of this pattern is to seek confidence, which is the product of consistent and congruent decisions. The common notion that confidence leads to success is flat wrong. It\u2019s successful behavior that creates confidence. You cannot have confidence without positive behaviors. If you took a minute to examine your recent past, when is the last \u201cpeak\u201d experience you can recall? When is the last powerful \u201cmoment\u201d that shifted how you saw the world? When was the last time you attempted something you\u2019ve never done before? When was the last time you put everything on the line for your convictions? When was the last time you made a real decision? Said Tony Robbins, \u201cA real decision is measured by the fact that you\u2019ve taken a new action. If there\u2019s no action, you haven\u2019t truly decided.\u201d Life-changing moments are inherently emotional. If you\u2019re not willing to deal with powerful (and sometimes difficult) emotions, then you\u2019ve frozen yourself in time. You\u2019ve settled for what you currently have. You\u2019ve shifted from seeking and approaching life to shielding and avoiding life. When you freeze yourself in time, you stop putting yourself in demanding situations that require you to rise up to a new level. You stop taking on roles you\u2019ve never played before\u200a\u2014\u200aand you settle for the environment and relational expectations that make up your current reality. You stop being willing to fail. You stop trying new things. You stop dreaming. You stop exercising faith. So how do you engineer more of these \u201cmoments\u201d into your life? From 2010 to 2014, I wanted to be a writer. But I never wrote. Two very important things happened that finally got me to commit to the dream I had lying dormant within me. That investment created a far deeper sense of commitment within me. Had I not made that investment, my commitment would have shrunk, not increased. I made two other important investments, which have now become \u201cpeak memories.\u201d They are moments that stick deeply in my memory. They altered the trajectory of my life. They enhanced my commitment to my dreams. They upgraded my subconscious belief system about what I could do with my life. I bought a $197 online course which taught me how to write viral headlines and pitch articles to big platforms. Then, I bought 20 copies of THE ART OF WORK in order to have a 30 minute conversation with Jeff Goins, a writer I aspired to be like. He was doing a promotion trying to sell more copies. This investment was a little bit of a mental stretch at the time. Paying around $250 to have a 30 minute phone call seemed a little crazy. But that phone call opened up lots of mental doors for me. It helped me get information directly from the source\u200a\u2014\u200awhich can be more powerful that reading books or taking online courses. Actually hearing the person talk to you. And acknowledge YOU. And for them to answer your questions directly is very powerful. Even if the answers they give you aren\u2019t profound. It\u2019s the fact that you\u2019re WATCHING YOURSELF move in the direction of your dreams. Those are powerful decisions, with huge consequence. Your decisions determine your destiny. Your decisions determine your confidence, or lack thereof. Your decisions determine your identity\u200a\u2014\u200awho you become is the product of your consistent choice. Your personality isn\u2019t a fixed and unchanging thing. That\u2019s a myth of Western culture. Your personality is multi-faceted. We all have multiple personalities. And our personalities should never stop developing and changing. Most people FREEZE in their development because they stop INVESTING in life-altering \u201cMOMENTS.\u201d They stop engineering peaks, pits, and transitions. They stop making powerful decisions. They stop creating conditions that force them to adapt in new and more powerful ways. They stop taking on greater responsibility\u200a\u2014\u200aand thus, are left with limited power. Very few people make truly committed decisions. Very few people invest in life-altering moments. Most people have frozen and fixed personalities\u200a\u2014\u200awhich remain locked-in-place because their environment supports their limiting beliefs and suppressed emotions. If you want to make big decisions, you need to put yourself into a powerful state of mind. You need to put yourself into an emotional place, where you\u2019re connected with your core values and beliefs. Where you\u2019re really feeling alive. I don\u2019t have a specific prescription for how to do that. However, a few key components of getting into such a state of mind are: You can and will change if you INVEST in peak experiences, and if you consistently act in desired ways. Confidence is a byproduct. Personality is a byproduct. Your behavior and decisions determine these things. Decisions determine destiny. I\u2019ve created a cheat sheet for putting yourself into a peak state, immediately. If you follow this daily, everything will change for you. Get the cheat sheet here!

I wanted to address the unknown, simple and incredibly profound life lessons that I\u2019ve learned. These lessons have come from the strangest of places and many of them are weird. I like to think that hidden in the weirdness and strangeness of life is where the golden nuggets of wisdom lie. That\u2019s why I have them around me when I write. They help me peer into another universe and see things up close. They are fully transparent and leave you with more questions than answers.

You probably took these short messages for granted. Next time you\u2019re at rock bottom though, see how these short messages can completely change everything. That\u2019s why I send messages like this all the time because you never know when someone is at rock bottom or may need a few words to change their perspective. I\u2019ve A/B tested content written with a messy desk and content written on a desk full of clutter. A clean desk always creates clearer thoughts that sound less distracted. That\u2019s all it took for me to get addicted to sugar again. Those small temptations always lead to bigger problems if you don\u2019t remain disciplined. Once you\u2019re rekindled with your temptations, your body demands more. Don\u2019t let a quick decision ruin everything you\u2019ve built for yourself. Keep saying no to things that don\u2019t serve you. Saying nasty stuff only brings more of that into your life. Watch how good a smile can be in even the toughest situation, and you\u2019ll see why you should never insult someone again. It breaks your thought pattern and creates anxiety. People will cut you off and make mistakes when you\u2019re driving. I\u2019ve learned to stop reacting so much which has made me calmer. Avoid the temptation to toot people. It hurts you more than it hurts them. \u201cYeah, yeah, yeah Tim, I get it\u200a\u2014\u200aread books!\u201d Well yes, you\u2019ve been told a hundred times to read more. I read heaps and sometimes it does feel pointless. The thing is that all it takes is one idea from a book to create a breakthrough. Most of the advice you read in books you\u2019ve heard before. Sometimes it\u2019s that one bit of advice, told in such a way, that creates a change in you.You could be one book away from changing your career, starting a new relationship or discovering a new passion. I had an old pair of pyjamas that always put me in a bad mood. I realized it was because these pyjamas used to be my gym clothes when I was at the top of my fitness game. If something brings you no joy, get rid of it. Try replacing old clothes with ones that you can create new memories in as your future self. Okay, hear me out. I did a diagram the other day and realized that even a simple kid from Australia with a relatively small network (I\u2019m talking about me) is only one or two connections away from Gary Vaynerchuk, Richard Branson, Tim Ferriss, and the founders of Uber and Airbnb. I\u2019m not kidding. You\u2019re closer to your heroes than you think. Everyone knows everyone which is a big advantage providing you don\u2019t abuse it. Washing it.Scratches.Petrol.Storing it. The same goes for many material possessions which suck up time that you could be using to crush your goals. I look forward to the day where we can all easily access a shared electric car. Cars are a distraction that rarely bring joy. Investment properties.Share trading.Buying crypto. These are all investments I\u2019ve made which have eaten up my free time that should have been used for blogging. The temptation to keep making more and more money that I\u2019ll probably never get to spend seems alluring in the moment. Stick to simple investments unless investing is your passion. Investments such as index funds typically beat the full-time investor and require little work to maintain. This leaves you more time and space in your brain to use on your passions in life. There\u2019s something about fresh air and trees that takes you out of your head. Greenery is what\u2019s needed when you\u2019ve been working hard and need an escape. You don\u2019t have to spend thousands and go overseas to have this simple escape. The local park can often be far enough. That\u2019s why I stopped the following: \u2013 Replying to every social media comment\u2013 Checking emails fifty times a day\u2013 Taking calls from unknown numbers\u2013 Streaming TV shows\u2013 Talking to people on the phone that piss me off\u2013 Going to events to \u201cmake an appearance\u201d Spending sixty seconds on something is how new habits can often be formed. I tried bouncing on a trampoline for sixty seconds and loved it; I tried eating sardines for sixty seconds and saw the benefits straight away; I tried smiling for no good reason for sixty seconds and saw the impact. That next encounter could be the love of your life. If you are determined to live life with the right positive attitude, then someone will find that attractive. If you tell everybody that you\u2019ll never find someone, then that\u2019s what life will deliver because you asked for it. I\u2019ve had some followers read my stuff for years. One of them the other day introduced me to a highly lucrative new business. Always be nice to everyone on social media.You never know where your next opportunity could come from. Always leave the world better than you found it. You would also like to find the toilet clean when nature calls. That\u2019s how I started my business by offering advice to a young man for free. Once you can add value to one person\u2019s life, you can be a coach. Through coaching, you can help pass on your knowledge and wisdom to others who can use it towards their goals. We all have it within us to be a coach. Becoming a coach is the first step to leadership. Leaders create change. Say it and then watch what it does. You\u2019ll feel good when you say it like you mean it. No one\u2019s here to be your butler so be nice to everyone. Say thank you and please with passion and gratitude. That\u2019s why lying will kill your success. Everything you do is being shared with your network so give people something inspiring, happy and positive to say about you. That\u2019s how you attract more of what you want into your life. I was sitting at a restaurant with a friend last week and a man who had very little was selling a magazine to feed himself. My friend gave him 5-dollars and told him to keep the magazine. That five dollars changed the man\u2019s day and he was so very happy that someone showed him kindness. My friend also felt great after the encounter. It doesn\u2019t take much to bring happiness to the world. It\u2019s not the money or things that creates happiness; it\u2019s the kindness you show when you do something without expecting anything in return. It\u2019s easier to be happy than you think.

An online action game World of Tanks has recently got its third gaming \u2018Oscar\u2019 in Still Playing category from one of game devs\u2019 most craved prestigious ceremonies The Golden Joystick Awards. Action games developed by Wargaming are played by more than 150 million people all over the world. This makes working on the design project even more fascinating and involving: the design to be easy-to-use and intuitive for every gamer from any part of the world. So, what is the Common Menu? (Let\u2019s call it CM). It is a global menu that enables users to conveniently navigate among various websites of the Wargaming Universe. It also has many other useful functions, such as showing notifications, displaying brief user profiles in each game of our battle universe, and lots of other things. The menu consisted of a grid with games, showed their signature art on hover and took the user to the game portal on click. It did its work. It was simple and laconic. More and more new games were being added. So the idea was to make access to content easier and faster, for example give the user all the needed information right in the menu without making him click through to the new and not-yet-familiar game. So it was time to increase the number of features on the menu and expand its uses. But at the same time the style of the old menu had to be retained. \u201cHold on, why don\u2019t we take the old CM design as a basis and add some new features to it?\u201d (I am sure many designers have heard similar suggestions\u00a0:) Why not? We worked on that option for a while, but the design ended up being unexciting and very overloaded with info. Take a look at it below: Next, we decided to come up with something completely different and visually new. That was when the new version of the design started showing through. So, after a few iterations we ended up with the following changes: For the final version we selected the most logical and clear composition of elements in the design. From there the phase of adapting it to different games began. To see how workable the selected design was we started applying different arts. Below you can see us playing with World of Tanks Blitz. The next stage was to bring in the team of artists who created the company\u2019simagery. And as a result we had excellent background images, some of them based on the existing arts and some involving completely new designs evolved specially for the menu. Each game also has its signature logo and color that are approved by the marketing department. And below you can see a small assortment of arts that were eventually brought together by the art and marketing teams. After that we got down to adapting the menu for a variety of devices requiringdifferent breakpoints. We chose the classical layout\u200a\u2014\u200ablocks from left to right (on PC) are simply rearranged vertically from top to bottom (on mobile devices). It was also decided to maintain the branding and style of each game and keep the arts on all the breakpoints. The horizontal layout of the game list rearranges itself into a collapsed vertical list on small screen real estate. For user convenience it was decided not to display all the games by default, but to expose a game when the user taps it in the list. In the collapsed vertical list game logos were transformed into svg-icons and placed to the left of the game names. Having gone all the way to complete this complex but exciting project I learned some things that, I hope, you may also find useful: Don\u2019t be afraid to suggest new solutions to problems. Depart from the old layout and grid completely. Take a fresh look at the task. Play the company\u2019s game again (if you are working in a game company), study the guidelines, have a look at what your colleagues are doing and what\u2019s going on in the world. Use the best elements from the sources available\u200a\u2014\u200alike the most successful texts, icons, arts\u200a\u2014\u200aand turn these pieces of jigsaw puzzle into a coherent whole that is meaningful and relevant. 2. Be obstinate\u00a0\u2026 sometimes. Stubbornness can be an admirable or notorious quality in a designer (depending on his or her point of view). If a client, team or design assignment insists on simply changing the old design but you clearly know that you can make a better one from scratch then do it. But make and present both old and new prototypes to clearly show the difference between the two. Don\u2019t be lazy, it may involve some extra work, but it is worth it. 3. Accept criticism\u00a0\u2026 most of the time. A designer who honestly evaluates his or her work often finds that the \u2018good job\u2019 rejected by a business, art director or team is, in fact, not that \u2018good\u2019. In most cases criticism has a favorable effect on the progress and quality of work. We are all human beings; we all get tired sometimes and stop thinking and seeing clearly. At such moments high-quality criticism does a power of good. Don\u2019t settle for artless comments like: \u201cEverything is amiss!\u201d or \u201cSomething is wrong here!\u201d Ask specific questions, and getting the answers would start you thinking on how to go ahead with the project. 4. Understand the large picture. Designing is a problem-solving job. But besides dealing with the issues directly specified in the assignment it is important to understand why those needs emerged in the first place and consider the possible future moves, like whether the design will later be scaled or the requirements towards a certain element raised. Where is the company going? What design-related difficulties may arise? Will the users stick to just one language or is a localization forthcoming and the length of words is going to change? 5. Keep to your principles. To work creatively a designer has to have the courage to stand up for his creeds. Fundamental strength of your principles is a source of creative power along with the talent.

Sometimes we feel motivated, and we managed to do something, but in most cases, bad habits take over, and we don\u2019t move towards our positive habits. Sounds familiar? Same thing with this article. I know that it will help me keep my streak, and on the other hand, it will provide value to your, my dear reader. Over the years, I\u2019ve done numerous experiments on how to form various habits. Ranging from coding, learning how to write, learning a language, getting up at 4:30 AM, eating healthy, dieting and so on. I\u2019ve gone through every possible book and research on this topic, that I came to the point when I was just exhausted with the amount of information I had in my head, and I needed to simplify it. You\u2019ve probably heard that it takes up to 21 days to form a new habit? That\u2019s nothing more than a myth, passed on by self-help gurus that wanted something easier to sell. According to research done by Phillippa Lally (health psychology researcher at University College London) and her research team, published in the European Journal of Social Psychology, to form a new habit, it takes on average more than two months before a new behavior becomes automatic\u200a\u2014\u200a66 days to be exact. Now, that\u2019s a lot of time. But if you look at a habit, there are two sides of it: Each one of these two sides has one central principle that helps you do it efficiently. Even though the research says 66 days, you shouldn\u2019t think about that much in advance. In our human nature is to overburden ourselves, and this tends to demotivate us. So even if your goal is to lose weight in 2 months, think about just one day. For the next 24 hours, your job is to do your best to eat as healthy as you can. Just one thing, and one small action towards it. No significant changes, no big leaps. Once you do it in one day, your job is to repeat it again tomorrow. Learn, improve and act. Quite simple. Now let\u2019s see what can be done about the behavior we are trying to eliminate. In the book 1984 (Nineteen Eighty-four) by George Orwell, there is a part where the members of the Outer Party are torturing Winston (the main protagonist), trying to break his spirit, and as they are beating him, there was one particular sentence he kept repeating to himself: \u201cI will confess, but not yet. I must hold out till the pain becomes unbearable. Three more kicks, two more kicks, and then I will tell them what they want.\u201d This got me thinking. Usually, when we want to establish a good habit, we tend to procrastinate. We postpone the positive behavior. But what if we use that for the negative behavior?So, I decided to do an experiment. Just one habit, and to focus on it in the span of 24hours. If I feel the urge to break it, I will postpone it. For tomorrow. It was eating healthy. I went to buy groceries, and I had a sweet tooth. When I saw the ice cream, I told myself:\u201cYou can have it tomorrow, but today get some veggies.\u201d I did. It was hard, but the idea that tomorrow ice cream was waiting for me was enough to let it go today. When I got up in the morning, I followed the rule for the establishing the habit. I focused on the healthy eating part, in just one day, and that was it. When I thought about ice cream, I told myself the same thing: \u201cYou can have it tomorrow.\u201d After I repeated this for 3\u20134 days, it became easier. My body was cleaning from sugar, and I didn\u2019t feel it anymore. And from then on, this is what I have been doing. Procrastinating on bad behavior. It works like a charm. If you still feel the temptation, ask yourself following questions: By asking these questions, you will bring the issue at hand to the logical part of your brain. Once you become aware consciously that you have no value from indulging, it will be much easier to resist\u200a\u2014\u200aif nothing, to postpone it for the next day. But I have to warn you about two things. First, people often want to reinvent themselves and the way the lead their life. This usually implies that they want to eliminate several habits and start several new ones. My advice is to start only with one habit unless the other habit you want to start is a supplement to the first one. This means that if you want to start with your health, you can start with healthy diet first, but exercising is a supplement. Eating healthier will give you enough results on its own, without jeopardizing your habit. You can add exercise if you want to achieve this faster, but it should be added slowly and without pressure. Second, it\u2019s easy to break habits. That\u2019s why you must have this in mind. The longer the habit lasts, the harder it is to break it. The shorter it lasts, it\u2019s easier to break it. For example: If you eat healthy for two months, even if you cheat for a day or two, it will be simpler to go back to eating healthy. But, if you had only started a habit five days ago, and you cheat even once, this can jeopardize your habit. Twice, and you probably won\u2019t go back to eating healthy. And then it will take you most likely several weeks before you motivate yourself to start again. So, try to be diligent. That\u2019s it. Now, I know that you have a habit you want to start. Go easy on yourself, and think in a span of 24hours. One small action towards it. And tomorrow just repeat and improve.

Since then, quite a bit has happened, further cementing my view that these changes are coming and that the implications will be even more substantial. I decided it was time to update this article with some additional ideas and a few changes. As I write this, Uber just announced that it just ordered 24,000 self-driving Volvos. Tesla just released an electric, long-haul tractor trailer with extraordinary technical specs (range, performance) and self-driving capabilities (UPS just preordered 125!). And, Tesla just announced what will probably be the quickest production car ever made\u200a\u2014\u200aperhaps the fastest. It will go zero to sixty in about the time it takes you to read zero to sixty. And, of course, it will be able to drive itself. The future is quickly becoming now. Google just ordered thousands of Chryslers for its self-driving fleet (that are already on the roads in AZ). In September of 2016, Uber had just rolled out its first self-driving taxis in Pittsburgh, Tesla and Mercedes were rolling out limited self-driving capabilities and cities around the world were negotiating with companies who want to bring self-driving cars and trucks to their cities. Since then, all of the major car companies have announced significant steps towards mostly or entirely electric vehicles, more investments have been made in autonomous vehicles, driverless trucks now seem to be leading rather than following in terms of the first large scale implementations and there\u2019ve been a few more incidents (i.e. accidents). I believe that the timeframe for significant adoption of this technology has shrunk in the past year as technology has gotten better faster and as the trucking industry has increased its level of interest and investment. I believe that my daughter, who is now just over 1 years old, will never have to learn to drive or own a car. The impact of driverless vehicles will be profound and impact almost every part of our lives. Below are my updated thoughts about what a driverless future will be like. Some of these updates are from feedback to my original article (thanks to those who contributed!!!), some are based on technology advances in the past year and others are just my own speculations. What could happen when cars and trucks drive themselves? 1. People won\u2019t own their own cars. Transport will be delivered as a service from companies who own fleets of self-driving vehicles. There are so many technical, economic, safety advantages to the transportation-as-a-service that this change may come much faster than most people expect. Owning a vehicle as an individual will become a novelty for collectors and maybe competitive racers. 2. Software/technology companies will own more of the world\u2019s economy as companies like Uber, Google and Amazon turn transportation into a pay-as-you-go service. Software will indeed eat this world. Over time, they\u2019ll own so much data about people, patterns, routes and obstacles that new entrants will have huge barriers to enter the market 3. Without government intervention (or some sort of organized movement), there will be a tremendous transfer of wealth to a very small number of people who own the software, battery/power manufacturing, vehicle servicing and charging/power generation/maintenance infrastructure. There will be massive consolidation of companies serving these markets as scale and efficiency will become even more valuable. Cars (perhaps they\u2019ll be renamed with some sort-of-clever acronym) will become like the routers that run the Internet\u200a\u2014\u200amost consumers won\u2019t know or care who made them or who owns them. 4. Vehicle designs will change radically\u200a\u2014\u200avehicles won\u2019t need to withstand crashes in the same way, all vehicles will be electric (self-driving + software + service providers = all electric). They may look different, come in very different shapes and sizes, maybe attach to each other in some situations. There will likely be many significant innovations in materials used for vehicle construction\u200a\u2014\u200afor example, tires and brakes will be re-optimized with very different assumptions, especially around variability of loads and much more controlled environments. The bodies will likely be primarily made of composites (like carbon fiber and fiberglass) and 3D printed. Electric vehicles with no driver controls will require 1/10th or fewer the number of parts (perhaps even 1/100th) and thus will be quicker to produce and require much less labor. There may even be designs with almost no moving parts (other than wheels and motors, obviously). 5. Vehicles will mostly swap batteries rather than serve as the host of battery charging. Batteries will be charged in distributed and highly optimized centers\u200a\u2014\u200alikely owned by the same company as the vehicles or another national vendor. There may be some entrepreneurial opportunity and a marketplace for battery charging and swapping, but this industry will likely be consolidated quickly. The batteries will be exchanged without human intervention\u200a\u2014\u200alikely in a carwash-like drive thru 6. Vehicles (being electric) will be able to provide portable power for a variety of purposes (which will also be sold as a service)\u200a\u2014\u200aconstruction job sites (why use generators), disaster/power failures, events, etc. They may even temporarily or permanently replace power distribution networks (i.e. power lines) for remote locations\u200a\u2014\u200aimagine a distributed power generation network with autonomous vehicles providing \u201clast mile\u201d services to some locations 7. Driver\u2019s licenses will slowly go away as will the Department of Motor Vehicles in most states. Other forms of ID may emerge as people no longer carry driver\u2019s licenses. This will probably correspond with the inevitable digitization of all personal identification\u200a\u2014\u200avia prints, retina scans or other biometric scanning 8. There won\u2019t be any parking lots or parking spaces on roads or in buildings. Garages will be repurposed\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe as mini loading docks for people and deliveries. Aesthetics of homes and commercial buildings will change as parking lots and spaces go away. There will be a multi-year boom in landscaping and basement and garage conversions as these spaces become available 9. Traffic policing will become redundant. Police transport will also likely change quite a bit. Unmanned police vehicles may become more common and police officers may use commercial transportation to move around routinely. This may dramatically change the nature of policing, with newfound resources from the lack of traffic policing and dramatically less time spent moving around 10. There will be no more local mechanics, car dealers, consumer car washes, auto parts stores or gas stations. Towns that have been built around major thoroughfares will change or fade 11. The auto insurance industry as we know it will go away (as will the significant investing power of the major players of this industry). Most car companies will go out of business, as will most of their enormous supplier networks. There will be many fewer net vehicles on the road (maybe 1/10th, perhaps even less) that are also more durable, made of fewer parts and much more commoditized 12. Traffic lights and signs will become obsolete. Vehicles may not even have headlights as infrared and radar take the place of the human light spectrum. The relationship between pedestrians (and bicycles) and cars and trucks will likely change dramatically. Some will come in the form of cultural and behavioral changes as people travel in groups more regularly and walking or cycling becomes practical in places where it isn\u2019t today 13. Multi-modal transportation will become a more integrated and normal part of our ways of moving around. In other words, we\u2019ll often take one type of vehicle to another, especially when traveling longer distances. With coordination and integration, the elimination of parking and more deterministic patterns, it will become ever-more efficient to combine modes of transport 14. The power grid will change. Power stations via alternative power sources will become more competitive and local. Consumers and small businesses with solar panels, small scale tidal or wave power generators, windmills and other local power generation will be able to sell KiloWattHours to the companies who own the vehicles. This will change \u201cnet metering\u201d rules and possibly upset the overall power delivery model. It might even be the beginning of truly distributed power creation and transport. There will likely be a significant boom in innovation in power production and delivery models. Over time, ownership of these services will probably be consolidated across a very small number of companies 15. Traditional petroleum products (and other fossil fuels) will become much less valuable as electric cars replace fuel powered vehicles and as alternative energy sources become more viable with portability of power (transmission and conversion eat tons of power). There are many geopolitical implications to this possible shift. As implications of climate change become ever-clearer and present, these trends will likely accelerate. Petroleum will continue to be valuable for making plastics and other derived materials, but will not be burned for energy at any scale. Many companies, oil-rich countries and investors have already begun accommodating for these changes 16. Entertainment funding will change as the auto industry\u2019s ad spending goes away. Think about how many ads you see or hear about cars, car financing, car insurance, car accessories and car dealers. There are likely to be many other structural and cultural changes that come from the dramatic changes to the transportation industry. We\u2019ll stop saying \u201cshift into high gear\u201d and other driving-related colloquialisms as the references will be lost on future generations 17. The recent corporate tax rate reductions in the \u201c..Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018\u201d will accelerate investments in automation including self-driving vehicles and other forms of transportation automation. Flush with new cash and incentives to invest capital soon, many businesses will invest in technology and solutions that reduce their labor costs. 18. The car financing industry will go away, as will the newly huge derivative market for packaged sub-prime auto loans which will likely itself cause a version of the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis as it blows up. 19. Increases in unemployment, increased student loan, vehicle and other debt defaults could quickly spiral into a full depression. The world that emerges on the other side will likely have even more dramatic income and wealth stratification as entry level jobs related to transportation and the entire supply chain of the existing transportation system go away. The convergence of this with hyper-automation in production and service delivery (AI, robotics, low-cost computing, business consolidation, etc) may permanently change how societies are organized and how people spend their time 20. There will be many new innovations in luggage and bags as people no longer keep stuff in cars and loading and unloading packages from vehicles becomes much more automated. The traditional trunk size and shape will change. Trailers or other similar detachable devices will become much more commonplace to add storage space to vehicles. Many additional on demand services will become available as transportation for goods and services becomes more ubiquitous and cheaper. Imagine being able to design, 3D print and put on an outfit as you travel to a party or the office (if you\u2019re still going to an office)\u2026 21. Consumers will have more money as transportation (a major cost, especially for lower income people and families) gets much cheaper and ubiquitous\u200a\u2014\u200athough this may be offset by dramatic reductions in employment as technology changes many times faster than people\u2019s ability to adapt to new types of work 22. Demand for taxi and truck drivers will go down, eventually to zero. Someone born today might not understand what a truck driver is or even understand why someone would do that job\u200a\u2014\u200amuch like people born in the last 30 years don\u2019t understand how someone could be employed as a switchboard operator 23. The politics will get ugly as lobbyists for the auto and oil industries unsuccessfully try to stop the driverless car. They\u2019ll get even uglier as the federal government deals with assuming huge pension obligations and other legacy costs associated with the auto industry. My guess is that these pension obgligations won\u2019t ultimately be honored and certain communities will be devastated. The same may be true of pollution clean-up efforts around the factories and chemical plants that were once major components of the vehicle supply chain 24. The new players in vehicle design and manufacturing will be a mix of companies like Uber, Google and Amazon and companies you don\u2019t yet know. There will probably be 2 or 3 major players who control >80% of the customer-facing transportation market. There may become API-like access to these networks for smaller players\u200a\u2014\u200amuch like app marketplaces for iPhone and Android. However, the majority of the revenue will flow to a few large players as it does today to Apple and Google for smartphones 25. Supply chains will be disrupted as shipping changes. Algorithms will allow trucks to be fuller. Excess (latent) capacity will be priced cheaper. New middlemen and warehousing models will emerge. As shipping gets cheaper, faster and generally easier, retail storefronts will continue to lose footing in the marketplace. 26. The role of malls and other shopping areas will continue to shift\u200a\u2014\u200ato be replaced by places people go for services, not products. There will be virtually no face to face purchases of physical goods. 27. Amazon and/or a few other large players will put Fedex, UPS and USPS out of business as their transportation network becomes orders of magnitude more cost efficient than existing models\u200a\u2014\u200alargely from a lack of legacy costs like pensions, higher union labor costs and regulations (especially USPS) that won\u2019t keep up with new the pace of technology change. 3D printing will also contribute to this as many day-to-day products are printed at home rather than purchased. 28. The same vehicles will often transport people and goods as algorithms optimize all routes. And, off-peak utilization will allow for other very inexpensive delivery options. In other words, packages will be increasingly delivered at night. Add autonomous drone aircraft to this mix and there\u2019ll be very little reason to believe that traditional carriers (Fedex, USPS, UPS, etc) will survive at all. 29. Roads will be much emptier and smaller (over time) as self-driving cars need much less space between them (a major cause of traffic today), people will share vehicles more than today (carpooling), traffic flow will be better regulated and algorithmic timing (i.e. leave at 10 versus 9:30) will optimize infrastructure utilization. Roads will also likely be smoother and turns optimally banked for passenger comfort. High speed underground and above ground tunnels (maybe integrating hyperloop technology or this novel magnetic track solution) will become the high speed network for long haul travel. 30. Short hop domestic air travel may be largely displaced by multi-modal travel in autonomous vehicles. This may be countered by the advent of lower cost, more automated air travel. This too may become part of integrated, multi-modal transportation. 31. Roads will wear out much more slowly with fewer vehicle miles, lighter vehicles (with less safety requirements). New road materials will be developed that drain better, last longer and are more environmentally friendly. These materials might even be power generating (solar or reclamation from vehicle kinetic energy). At the extreme, they may even be replaced by radically different designs\u200a\u2014\u200atunnels, magnetic tracks, other hyper-optimized materials 32. Premium vehicle services will have more compartmentalized privacy, more comfort, good business features (quiet, wifi, bluetooth for each passenger, etc), massage services and beds for sleeping. They may also allow for meaningful in-transit real and virtual meetings. This will also likely include aromatherapy, many versions of in-vehicle entertainment systems and even virtual passengers to keep you company. 33. Exhilaration and emotion will almost entirely leave transportation. People won\u2019t brag about how nice, fast, comfortable their cars are. Speed will be measured by times between end points, not acceleration, handling or top speed. 34. Cities will become much more dense as fewer roads and vehicles will be needed and transport will be cheaper and more available. The \u201cwalkable city\u201d will continue to be more desirable as walking and biking become easier and more commonplace. When costs and timeframes of transit change, so will the dynamics of who lives and works where. 35. People will know when they leave, when they\u2019ll get where they\u2019re going. There will be few excuses for being late. We will be able to leave later and cram more into a day. We\u2019ll also be able to better track kids, spouses, employees and so forth. We\u2019ll be able to know exactly when someone will arrive and when someone needs to leave to be somewhere at a particular time. 36. There will be no more DUI/OUI offenses. Restaurants and bars will sell more alcohol. People will consume more as they no longer need to consider how to get home and will be able to consume inside vehicles 37. We\u2019ll have less privacy as interior cameras and usage logs will track when and where we go and have gone. Exterior cameras will also probably record surroundings, including people. This may have a positive impact on crime, but will open up many complex privacy issues and likely many lawsuits. Some people may find clever ways to game the system\u200a\u2014\u200awith physical and digital disguises and spoofing. 38. Many lawyers will lose sources of revenue\u200a\u2014\u200atraffic offenses, crash litigation will reduce dramatically. Litigation will more likely be \u201cbig company versus big company\u201d or \u201cindividuals against big companies\u201d, not individuals against each other. These will settle more quickly with less variability. Lobbyists will probably succeed in changing the rules of litigation to favor the bigger companies, further reducing the legal revenue related to transportation. Forced arbitration and other similar clauses will become an explicit component of our contractual relationship with transportation providers. 39. Some countries will nationalize parts of their self-driving transportation networks which will result in lower costs, fewer disruptions and less innovation. 40. Cities, towns and police forces will lose revenue from traffic tickets, tolls (likely replaced, if not eliminated) and fuel tax revenues drop precipitously. These will probably be replaced by new taxes (probably on vehicle miles). These may become a major political hot-button issue differentiating parties as there will probably be a range of regressive versus progressive tax models. Most likely, this will be a highly regressive tax in the US, as fuel taxes are today. 41. Some employers and/or government programs will begin partially or entirely subsidizing transportation for employees and/or people who need the help. The tax treatment of this perk will also be very political. 42. Ambulance and other emergency vehicles will likely be used less and change in nature. More people will take regular autonomous vehicles instead of ambulances. Ambulances will transport people faster. Same may be true of military vehicles. 43. There will be significant innovations in first response capabilities as dependencies on people become reduced over time and as distributed staging of capacity becomes more common. 44. Airports will allow vehicles right into the terminals, maybe even onto the tarmac, as increased controls and security become possible. Terminal design may change dramatically as transportation to and from becomes normalized and integrated. The entire nature of air travel may change as integrated, multi-modal transport gets more sophisticated. Hyper-loops, high speed rail, automated aircraft and other forms of rapid travel will gain as traditional hub and spoke air travel on relatively large planes lose ground. 45. Innovative app-like marketplaces will open up for in-transit purchases, ranging from concierge services to food to exercise to merchandise to education to entertainment purchases. VR will likely play a large role in this. With integrated systems, VR (via headsets or screens or holograms) will become standard fare for trips more than a few minutes in duration. 46. Transportation will become more tightly integrated and packaged into many services\u200a\u2014\u200adinner includes the ride, hotel includes local transport, etc. This may even extend to apartments, story-term rentals (like AirBnB) and other service providers. 47. Local transport of nearly everything will become ubiquitous and cheap\u200a\u2014\u200afood, everything in your local stores. Drones will likely be integrated into vehicle designs to deal with \u201clast few feet\u201d on pickup and delivery. This will accelerate the demise of traditional retail stores and their local economic impact. 48. Biking and walking will become easier, safer and more common as roads get safer and less congested, new pathways (reclaimed from roads/parking lots/roadside parking) come online and with cheap, reliable transport available as a backup. 49. More people will participate in vehicle racing (cars, off road, motorcycles) to replace their emotional connection to driving. Virtual racing experiences may also grow in popularity as fewer people have the real experience of driving. 50. Many, many fewer people will be injured or killed on roads, though we\u2019ll expect zero and be disproportionately upset when accidents do happen. Hacking and non-malicious technical issues will replace traffic as the main cause of delays. Over time, resilience will increase in the systems. 51. Hacking of vehicles will be a serious issue. New software and communications companies and technologies will emerge to address these issues. We\u2019ll see the first vehicle hacking and its consequences. Highly distributed computing, perhaps using some form of blockchain, will likely become part of the solution as a counterbalance to systemic catastrophes\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as many vehicles being affected simultaneously. There will probably be a debate about whether and how law enforcement can control, observe and restrict transportation. 52. Many roads and bridges will be privatized as a small number of companies control most transport and make deals with municipalities. Over time, government may entirely stop funding roads, bridges and tunnels. There will be a significant legislative push to privatize more and more of the transportation network. Much like Internet traffic, there will likely become tiers of prioritization and some notion of in-network versus out-of-network travel and tolls for interconnection. Regulators will have a tough time keeping up with these changes. Most of this will be transparent to end users, but will probably create enormous barriers to entry for transportation start-ups and ultimately reduce options for consumers. 53. Innovators will come along with many awesome uses for driveways and garages that no longer contain cars. 54. There will be a new network of clean, safe, pay-to-use restrooms and other services (food, drinks, etc) that become part of the value-add of competing service providers 55. Mobility for seniors and people with disabilities will be greatly improved (over time) 56. Parents will have more options to move around their kids on their own. Premium secure end-to-end children\u2019s transport services will likely emerge. This may change many family relationships and increase the accessibility of services to parents and children. It may also further stratify the experiences of families with higher income and those with lower income. 57. Person to person movement of goods will become cheaper and open up new markets\u200a\u2014\u200athink about borrowing a tool or buying something on Craigslist. Latent capacity will make transporting goods very inexpensive. This may also open up new opportunities for P2P services at a smaller scale\u200a\u2014\u200alike preparing food or cleaning clothes. 58. People will be able to eat/drink in transit (like on a train or plane), consume more information (reading, podcasts, video, etc). This will open up time for other activities and perhaps increased productivity. 59. Some people may have their own \u201cpods\u201d to get into which will then be picked up by an autonomous vehicle, moved between vehicles automatically for logistic efficiencies. These may come in varieties of luxury and quality\u200a\u2014\u200athe Louis Vuitton pod may replace the Louis Vuitton trunk as the mark of luxury travel 60. There will be no more getaway vehicles or police vehicle chases. 61. Vehicles will likely be filled to the brim with advertising of all sorts (much of which you could probably act on in-route), though there will probably be ways to pay more to have an ad free experience. This will include highly personalized en route advertising that is particularly relevant to who you are, where you\u2019re going. 62. These innovations will make it to the developing world where congestion today is often remarkably bad and hugely costly. Pollution levels will come down dramatically. Even more people will move to the cities. Productivity levels will go up. Fortunes will be made as these changes happen. Some countries and cities will be transformed for the better. Some others will likely experience hyper-privatization, consolidation and monopoly-like controls. This may play out much like the roll-out of cell services in these countries\u200a\u2014\u200afast, consolidated and inexpensive. 63. Payment options will be greatly expanded, with packaged deals like cell phones, pre-paid models, pay-as-you-go models being offered. Digital currency transacted automatically via phones/devices will probably quickly replace traditional cash or credit card payments. 64. There will likely be some very clever innovations for movement of pets, equipment, luggage and other non-people items. Autonomous vehicles in the medium future (10\u201320 years) may have radically different designs that support carrying significantly more payload. 65. Some creative marketers will offer to partially or fully subsidize rides where customers deliver value\u200a\u2014\u200aby taking surveys, by participating in virtual focus groups, by promoting their brand via social media, etc. 66. Sensors of all sorts will be embedded in vehicles that will have secondary uses\u200a\u2014\u200alike improving weather forecasting, crime detection and prevention, finding fugitives, infrastructure conditions (such as potholes). This data will be monetized, likely by the companies who own the transportation services. 67. Companies like Google and Facebook will add to their databases everything about customer movements and locations. Unlike GPS chips that only tell them where someone is at the moment (and where they\u2019ve been), autonomous vehicle systems will know where you\u2019re going in real-time (and with whom). 68. Autonomous vehicles will create some new jobs and opportunities for entrepreneurs. However, these will be off-set many times by extraordinary job losses by nearly everyone in the transportation value chain today. In the autonomous future, a large number of jobs will go away. This includes drivers (which is in many states today the most common job), mechanics, gas station employees, most of the people who make cars and car parts or support those who do (due to huge consolidation of makers and supply chains and manufacturing automation), the marketing supply chain for vehicles, many people who work on and build roads/bridges, employees of vehicle insurance and financing companies (and their partners/suppliers), toll booth operators (most of whom have already been displaced), many employees of restaurants that support travelers, truck stops, retail workers and all the people whose businesses support these different types of companies and workers. 69. There will be some hardcore hold-outs who really like driving. But, over time, they\u2019ll become a less statistically relevant voting group as younger people, who\u2019ve never driven, will outnumber them. At first, this may be a 50 state regulated system\u200a\u2014\u200awhere driving yourself may actually become illegal in some states in the next 10 years while other states may continue to allow it for a long time. Some states will try, unsuccessfully, to block autonomous vehicles. 70. There will be lots of discussions about new types of economic systems\u200a\u2014\u200afrom universal basic income to new variations of socialism to a more regulated capitalist system\u200a\u2014\u200athat will result from the enormous impacts of autonomous vehicles. 71. In the path to a truly driverless future, there will be a number of key tipping points. At the moment, freight delivery may push autonomous vehicle use sooner than people transport. Large trucking companies may have the financial means and legislative influence to make rapid, dramatic changes. They are also better positioned to support hybrid approaches where only parts of their fleet or parts of the routes are automated. 72. Autonomous vehicles will radically change the power centers of the world. They will be the beginning of the end of burning hydrocarbons. The powerful interests who control these industries today will fight viciously to stop this. There may even be wars to slow down this process as oil prices start to plummet and demand dries up. 73. Autonomous vehicles will continue to play a larger role in all aspects of war\u200a\u2014\u200afrom surveillance to troop/robot movement to logistics support to actual engagement. Drones will be complemented by additional on-the-ground, in-space, in-the-water and under-the-water autonomous vehicles. Note: My original article was inspired by a presentation by Ryan Chin, CEO of Optimus Ridespeak at an MIT event about autonomous vehicles. He really got me thinking about how profound these advances could be to our lives. I\u2019m sure some of my thoughts above came from him.

But during autumn of 2017 in App Store appeared a lot of AR apps. Almost all of them used ARKit. In the beginning, user flow of augmented reality applications wasn\u2019t clear. I wanted to define what interaction patterns are the most popular in ARKit apps. So, I made an extensive analysis of onboarding process for almost all apps available in App Store. Also, I have made UX reviews for free just to get experience and more insights. I keep noticing that for the first time users was tough to understand how AR works. Also, UI wasn\u2019t clear even for experienced in AR users. So learning curve for new users became even longer. It looks like first demos build mostly by Unity and iOS developers. Obviously, they didn\u2019t have the time or any other resources to hire experienced UX designer. Those times there wasn\u2019t settled interactions patterns that could be followed. Thus in my article \u201cOnboarding in augmented reality mobile application\u201d I tried to cover the essential steps and clarify on what to focus and what to avoid. I hope that it made at least single app more user-friendly. After some time Apple and Google released own guidelines for AR apps. Although they are beneficial, they still left blind spots. I do recommend to have a look if you didn\u2019t have a chance to learn them. While the time I collected a lot of screenshots and started noticing some pattern in building user flows and using UI components in AR apps. So I decided to create UI kit that could be sophisticated enough for designers, but also can be useful for developers that can find suitable UI solutions to copy. For easy searching I sorted all screens in next categories: It\u2019s first and the most confusing moment for first-time users. An app should gently (or not) let a user know that it needs some info about the environment. Once application scanned area and detected planes, a user can start placing 3d content. There are different interaction patterns, that can be suitable for different situations. This step is about playing with augmented objects itself. In flat UI there are a lot of stable well-know patters, as swipe from the top to update page, and so on. In AR it\u2019s like the wild west. Apple and Google tried to define some situations. But sometimes case require unique interactions. It\u2019s critical to introduce them gently. Depending on the importance it can be small tip net to the button or almost full page popup. Maybe the most well known AR app is Pok\u00e9mon GO, what is location based. I hope that in future we will get much more interesting cases of using location-based augmented reality For some applications, AR isn\u2019t the main feature. Show object in AR is the only option. Apple suggested the icon for consistency. But I haven\u2019t noticed it in any application that I tested. Also, lists and galleries are the most obvious ways to find a model. All his time user spends in camera view. There can be various UI components that help interact with AR world. To quickly explain some gestures and concepts to a user I created the collection of icons: I hope that this collection will help to create more user-fieldy augmented reality mobile applications.

I have teamed up with John Kim\u200a\u2014\u200alicensed therapist, published author, and another one of our most beloved top writers in Love and Relationships on Medium, specializing in \u201cself help in a shotglass\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aand together we addressed one of the biggest themes we see: Here\u2019s both of our takes on this. John wrote from the angle of \u201cLife;\u201d I wrote from the angle of \u201cLove\u201d and relationships. In the words of John, Let us know! Johnkim: Pull back / Work backwards / Just do one thing. Let me explain. I think we get stuck sometimes because we keep trying to shove a cylinder peg into a square hole. Do things over and over again that don\u2019t work or maybe isn\u2019t meant to happen right now. And we just drain our energy and hope. Basically, we fight the universe. That being said, you have to truly be honest with yourself and know the difference between not \u201cmeant to happen right now\u201d and being lazy or giving up. Let\u2019s take me for example. I felt the most \u201cnothing\u2019s working\u201d in my life at the tail end of my screenwriting career. I had been writing for nearly a decade. I was good enough to get representation, go on pitch meetings, sell a script, and get hired to write a show. But i just wasn\u2019t meant to have a screenwriter career at that point in my life. I\u2019m not saying \u201cat that point in my life\u201d because I want a screenwriting career now. I just know that anything is possible and life always has a funny way of coming back sometimes. So I don\u2019t hold on to blueprints so tightly anymore. Anyway, I definitely wasn\u2019t lazy. I wrote my ass off every single day for years. I put in the work. But the work is only part of the equation. There\u2019s talent. There\u2019s timing. There\u2019s magical uncontrollably universe shit you are not aware of until you look back and make sense of your story. So for me, I realized I wasn\u2019t happy and took a big step back. I\u2019ll be honest. It was extremely difficult to give up on a dream. To think all those hours writing in coffee shops went to waste. But did they? Depends on what you choose to believe. Whenever you feel stuck, the goal is to get emotional traction first. I believe if you can\u2019t change what\u2019s happening, you have to start by changing how you feel. Grow that feeling and your outcome will change. But here\u2019s the kicker. Maybe not in the way you planned. Things may unfold differently and you have leave room for that. In my example above, emotional traction meant totally letting go and switching gears by changing careers. That may not be the case for you. Maybe for you, emotional traction means setting smaller goals or different goals so you feel that there\u2019s movement, that there\u2019s something happening. This is where the second part comes in. Work backwards. Sometimes we get so stuck in our trenches, we don\u2019t see the path. If you don\u2019t see a path, you\u2019ll feel stuck and lost. So after you pull back, ask yourself what your goal is. Make it different or smaller goal that what you\u2019re trying to accomplish now. Then work backwards and ask yourself what you need to do and / or who you need to be in order to accomplish that goal.\u00a0By seeing the goal and working backwards, you can start to see it\u2019s possible instead of not seeing anything at all. The process of seeing the plan injects some hope. This hope will give you some traction. Remember, the goal can be small. All it is right now is a vine to pull you out of your quicksand. After pulling back and deciding I wanted to be a therapist and help people, the goal was first to get into therapy school. Getting my license was too far ahead. I just had to start the process. So I worked backwards by figuring out what I needed to do to get into a psychology Master\u2019s program. I worked backwards. Saw the path. And went. Then when I felt stuck in the program, I pulled back and focused on a smaller goal like graduating or finishing a paper, and worked backwards so I could see a path, know that it was possible. I constantly injected myself with shots of hope to get through. Now let\u2019s talk about the final piece. There\u2019s a book called \u201cJust do one thing\u201d. I haven\u2019t read it. I don\u2019t need to. I understand the concept from the title. And it\u2019s so true and powerful. Olympic Lifting is a very precision based sport. Just moving your hands one inch can drastically change the outcome of the lift. So coaches usually only give you one direction at a time. More than that and you end up doing nothing because there\u2019s so much focus involved. When we feel nothing\u2019s working, sometimes we just need to focus on one thing. We need to be a sniper instead of a shotgun. It\u2019s like that saying, doing one thing right is far better than doing ten things half ass. Or something like that, you know what I mean. Recap. PULL BACK This is always step one. Let go of whatever you\u2019re trying to tackle and take a step back. Breath. Maybe re-evaluate. Ask yourself why questions. What exactly are you trying to accomplish? Does it line up with your truth and story? WORK BACKWARDS You need to see a path so you have direction and believe it\u2019s actually possible. Break your goal down to small pieces or see a different goal. Work backwards so you see the path. That will give you a reset. Hopefully inject some hope. Once you accomplish the smaller or different goal, you\u2019re back in the game.\u00a0JUST DO ONE THING When you\u2019re feeling stuck, sniper over shotgun. Get super focused and zone in on one thing that\u2019s in your control that you can accomplish. One thing. Not fifty. You don\u2019t climb a peg board by looking up at all the holes you get to peg to get to the top. Your body gets heavy very fast. You just focus on inserting the peg into one hole at a time. Then suddenly realize you\u2019re at the top. I\u2019ve never been rock climbing but I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s probably the same. No one runs up mountains. They climb. Kris Gage: What should you do when \u201cnothing\u2019s working\u201d and you\u2019re at wit\u2019s end? Do the work for real. (Many people think they\u2019re doing this work when they\u2019re not.) People are in pain. They are suffering. They are struggling. And on top of this, they are trying. They follow their heart, exercise patience, talk to their partner, read books and articles, listen to friends, follow everyone\u2019s guidance\u2026 They seek to understand before being understood; they say sorry; they give more\u200a\u2014\u200aand then more again. They\u2019re sloughing through it. They want it to change. They want to make it work. And they try everything they can think of\u200a\u2014\u200aholding it it, letting it all out, writing it all down, talking it all over\u200a\u2014\u200aand none of it\u2019s working. They are seeing nothing as a result of the effort. They\u2019re coming at it from every angle and can\u2019t seem to get their head above water, the sheer pressure of the shit they\u2019re going through is so overwhelming. But what do we do when \u201cnothing\u2019s changing.?\u201d When our partner\u200a\u2014\u200aor the situation\u200a\u2014\u200ais still the same? I hear a lot of common themes from people frustrated with their situation. Comments like: I\u2019ve also heard things like: But also I hear seemingly-positive things like: But, overall, what I\u2019m hearing is: And the problem with all of this is that we\u2019re trying \u201ceverything\u201d except the one thing that will actually help. We\u2019re doggedly doing everything while simultaneously avoiding the only thing that matters. We\u2019ve felt so browbeaten for so long that we forget: And on that note: So if we\u2019re not happy, it\u2019s on us. We are also responsible for how we choose to respond. In fact, it\u2019s the only thing in life that we have complete control over. And we never, ever control what other think or feel or do. But there are two types of \u201cresponses:\u201d one is our reaction in the moment itself, what we choose to say, for example, to a partner who\u2019s shouting or shutting down. It took me two years to recognize it as emotional abuse, and then several more months to find the courage and confidence to get fed up and actually do something real about it. The whole time, I kept telling myself \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of \u2018good\u2019 here if we just work past this!\u201d I also kept thinking \u201cit\u2019s not that bad!\u201d And I kept investing more effort in how to be a good partner\u200a\u2014\u200aall the while just hoping he\u2019d take up his part and do the same. I just figured that if I was \u201cgood,\u201d the universe would be \u201cfair;\u201d that it would all but rearrange itself and \u201cmake\u201d my partner into the person I \u201cdeserved.\u201d Life doesn\u2019t work like that. I tried the entire time. We talked. We fought. I listened. I shared. I read the articles he sent me. I read books on \u201cfighting fair.\u201d We both promised to work on it\u200a\u2014\u200ato \u201cgive the other the benefit of the doubt,\u201d \u201coperate from love, not hate,\u201d and not to \u201cjump to conclusions.\u201d I stopped stonewalling and instead gave him my full undivided attention, even when he continued to pull every dirty move in the book: shouting, name-calling, accusing, gaslighting, insulting, watching for and then latching on to what he perceived as \u201clogical fallacies\u201d in anything I said and, most of all, getting defensive. He didn\u2019t read the books. When I sent him articles on \u201chow to apologize,\u201d he threw them back at me in arguments, calling them \u201cKG apologies\u201d as though I alone had made the concept of \u201chuman decency\u201d up. After I broke up with him, I realized a few important things: And, just to be clear, that also means that you are allowing everything that you continue to endure. You may think you deserve that pain, but you don\u2019t. It took me over two years to recognize the problem, and several more months to realize: he will never change. It was up to realize that two years was more than enough time for him to demonstrate any kind of improvement. Instead, things had only gotten worse. It was up to me to realize that I deserved better. It was up to me to realize \u201cenough is enough.\u201d And it was up to me to pull the plug on things. Because it does NOT just mean \u201ctaking blame\u201d or playing martyr in your own life. It means recognizing your agency and your role and your control. It\u2019s amazing how committed we can be to our situation. I hear people say things like, Saying \u201csorry\u201d is not \u201cowning your shit.\u201d That\u2019s like 1/100th of the \u201cshit\u201d we need to own\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially in situations like this. (If you were standing in the rain getting soaked to the bone, would you just stand there and apologize for forgetting an umbrella? No\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019d find a way to get inside. The same can be said for the degree of \u201cresponsibility\u201d we\u2019re talking about when we talk about your life overall.) \u201cWaiting for them to change\u201d or \u201choping\u201d they will is not \u201cdoing something.\u201d Dumping more energy into a relationship when they aren\u2019t is not \u201cdoing something.\u201d And crying, whining, getting angry or having emotional breakdowns definitely aren\u2019t \u201cdoing something.\u201d \u201cDoing something\u201d is noticing whether they are actually and truly trying to change. It\u2019s absorbing and accepting whether they\u2019re putting effort in, with their whole heart, or whether they \u201ctry\u201d just enough to keep you around. Most importantly, \u201cdoing something\u201d is leaving if the situation doesn\u2019t improve. Because nobody respects a person who states a demand and then just angrily sticks around when others continue to disregard it.\u00a0Doing something is taking control when you get fed up. It\u2019s taking responsibility and agency for your own life. You are not as trapped as you\u2019ve made yourself. You are not victim of your existence. It was about discerning a higher standard for myself\u200a\u2014\u200ahow I wanted to be treated in a relationship.

Our Facebook feed, news, posters, corporations, people want your attention. Wants you to buy things, help them, listen. We are bombarded with information. Dedicating our time and energy is extremely hard. It takes a lot of effort and keeping that focus is even harder. When your phone pings, when your friend rings, commercial, click baits. And people wonder why the millennials are fucked up. The more things we engage ourselves in the less energy we will have towards what we want to do. And this might not be that important to some people. But if you have clear goals and visions. Then separating ourselves and our work from distractions is a priority. Why? The way I see it. We each have a certain fuel tank of energy and focus. Once we use it all up, we are far more likely to give up and indulge ourselves in our impulses and desires. That\u00b4s why after a long day of work all you want to do is sloth around in your sofa and eat ice cream. Or why after studying all day for an exam you feel justified in going out and getting shitfaced on tequila. The good news is that you are able to exercise and build it up. In the same way that it can be forgotten, weakened and atrophied. Just like going to the gym and building strength, you can build discipline and focus by accomplishing a series of tasks on a daily basis. Lets take a step back and look at Serious Sam for a moment. Sam gets up every morning, makes his bed, gets all of his work done by noon, practices an instrument in the afternoon, learns a new language in his spare time, goes to the gym every other night, budgets his finances perfectly, calls his mother and feeds the dog. Do you really think Sam is forcing himself do all of these things every day against a wave of internal resistance? Of course not. He is a well oiled machine of habit. His actions are close to automatic and certainly doesn\u2019t require any willpower to maintain. Open a new document right now. Name it; Time to get serious. Write down the most important aspect of your life it could be family, work, hobby, passion. Write down the second most important aspect of your life. Third. Now that you have your priorities straight. Its time to set goals. Considering your number one priority in life, what do you want out of it? Do you want to be the best father to your daughter? Well how? Do you want to become the best in a certain field of expertise? How? Do you want to become a better person? Well, how? We\u00b4re getting somewhere. Your are taking yourself seriously. Once your document is finished. It wont take longer than an hour. You know what you truly want to achieve, you know what your focus should be, you know what motivates you. Most importantly you know why are doing it! Most people focus too much on the destination, lose 50 pounds, get a promotion, make more money or be the best father when instead, they should be focusing on the systems they have in place to get them there. Because with the right system, your goals practically take care of themselves. They have this \u201ccrash\u201d mentality, they say; \u201cI will lose 20 pounds in 3 months\u201d and then go ahead and performs some crazy diet or starvation. Most people approach the whole thing from a perspective of pure willpower. But willpower will only get you so far. A beautiful day you will run out of decision-making gas and cave in to the cravings. Instead we need to build a series of healthy life habits. Your willpower is then exerted on making simple lifestyle changes that are sustainable rather than drastic shifts that you have no hope of maintaining day after day, year after year. \u201cWe are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit\u201d With that said, we are left with the million dollar question. What small change can you do to ensure that you are making progress?

It\u2019s been a year now, and in honor of Fatshion February I thought I\u2019d report back on how that\u2019s going. Odds are you know someone already who does something similar in what they wear, or you\u2019ve read about the trend of wearing the same daily outfit in many of the more famous blogs like The Uniform Project or via brands that are building on the re-surging popularity of everyday basics like MM LaFleur. Often the value of wearing the same thing daily has been historically attributed to famous men, Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs, or Barack Obama and heralded as a sign of genius. But this presumption belies that the people who work in industries like beauty, service industry, and retail (all of the above, mostly women) have long been experiencing the benefits and weathering the challenges of wearing a daily uniform. If you have any friends who are stylists or makeup artists who seem to have endless wardrobes of impossibly cool, artsy black outfits, you know what I\u2019m talking about. Being forced to wear something daily like a workplace uniform when you\u2019d rather have the freedom to express yourself via fashion is decidedly not fun. In places that require business wear, dress codes can also highlight class divides in who can afford pricy suiting separates, reinforce gender and racial biases in what is considered a uniformly \u201cacceptable\u201d appearance, squash religious and cultural identities, and our first amendment right to personal expression. Like the grand debate with school uniforms, I think it\u2019s important to look at clothing as a way to say to yourself: which decisions in my day are removing a problem from my life, and which decisions are imposing new ones? When it\u2019s your choice to do so, the basic benefits of a personal uniform of some kind seem to remain the same for this reason: saved time, saved money, and saved mental load. The last benefit was a huge one for me. The opportunity to conserve the the emotional and physical energy I spent agonizing over how I wanted to look each day was the primary driver in making the jump. As a plus-sized person, I\u2019ve found I never had the same amount of choice in trying to find things to wear as my smaller friends. I never really felt I could fully \u201cexpress myself\u201d because I was trapped within whatever cheaply-made schmatta the fashion industry decided to toss in my direction this season. I\u2019m a half-decent seamstress, but not good enough at it to ensure I would have something durable enough for daily wear if I made it myself. The lifelong struggle and accompanying decision fatigue of trying to find a way to look acceptable to the world every morning, especially as a fat woman, was making me extremely unhappy, the money and time I spent on failed experiments in \u201cfinding my style\u201d even more so. It feels like a tax, and it hits your wallet like one too. When you\u2019re in a position to be able to stop doing any individual thing that\u2019s negatively affecting your life, the change is usually worth trying. So here\u2019s how I did it, explained via the FAQs I get when people find out that yes, they\u2019ve seen that dress on me before. I tried out a lot of different dresses from a brand I knew fit me well over a few weeks. Then once the Holy Grail had been found, I immediately purchased 6 to start, and then 6 more after my tax return came back. This particular black, cotton-blend v-neck dress is machine-washable, comfortable for my climate, and doesn\u2019t wrinkle in my luggage. At a cost of about $40 each, this brought my total wardrobe for the year to about $480 for workwear. I could have likely gotten away with maybe 8 dresses instead of 12, but it seems to lessen the wear and tear on them. A dress may not work for your workplace, but similar can be accomplished via your usual work clothes. If you need to wear a button-down, consider multiples of each, or a skirt and a cardigan, or multiples of a blazer if your workplace is on the more formal side. YMMV but for me color was another daily choice I didn\u2019t want to make, and tends to send me in to the backslide of spending energy making decisions about what jewelry coordinates, any layers matching etc. I\u2019m lucky in that my local climate means that the addition of tights and a layering sweater (maybe a coat if I have to travel out of state during winter) about does it for my cold weather needs. Adding on a belt, some fun jewelry, ankle boots, can be a fun way to stretch the look if you desire some variation. I personally discovered via SF\u2019s requirement of carrying a sensible layer with you everywhere that sweater vests can be surprisingly chic. When it\u2019s too hot for long sleeves, I swap to a short sleeve dress that\u2026 surprise surprise, I also have a few multiples of at the moment. I live in California, so a hot weather variant is a necessity. If anyone has ever noticed, they haven\u2019t mentioned it to me. Do you remember what your coworkers wore yesterday? Last week? Me neither. People just aren\u2019t paying attention to what we\u2019re wearing the way we think they are. Anytime anyone has found out I wear the same thing daily, I\u2019ve only gotten compliments, and maybe a few of these frequently-asked questions. I don\u2019t find that I get bored, but that\u2019s because I definitely do make exceptions whenever doing so will make me happier (see above re: hot weather clothes.) I still have special occasion outfits, date night dresses, and other costumery I break out when circumstances warrant. There are no rules here, this isn\u2019t \u201ca challenge\u201d that you pass or fail, and taking a break isn\u2019t \u201ccheating.\u201d I\u2019m a firm believer that you should do a thing as much as it improves your life, and then stop when it doesn\u2019t. If it makes it happier or easier for you, you could just try wearing a uniform only on work days. You could do it for just a month. You could do it 20% of your time. It\u2019s about eliminating the choices you don\u2019t like making, which might be just some of the time. If you like them, keep them. After a few months of figuring out whether my uniform was working for me, I donated most of my clothing because it was taking up a lot of room in my life. Moving and caring for all those clothes was not making me very happy (are we sensing a theme here?) But yes, I do ever miss the things I donated. It\u2019s a normal feeling, and it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing it wrong. The trick is certainly not to admonish the love of fashion as pedestrian and free yourself of any emotional attachments to all earthly possessions like some kind of ascetic monk. The trick is instead to know that you\u2019ll ever have things you love again and maybe someone else is loving the thing you had now. I\u2019ll be honest, wearing the same thing every day has been the single thing I have done this past year that I feel has most contributed to the material satisfaction of my day-to-day life. In the last year I\u2019ve gotten more compliments on what I\u2019m wearing on dates, in interviews, and while running hackathons. I\u2019ve been most grateful for this choice when I have to pack last minute for a trip, and when I\u2019ve had to get it together to be somewhere important but short on time, or when I\u2019ve been hungover (just the facts.) It\u2019s been healing to my finances, my emotional energy, and limited the circumstances where I feel that my satisfaction with my body and appearance is contingent on whether or not I fit in to a particular piece of clothing. So I intend to continue wearing the exact same dress every day, as long as it feels good and is practical for my needs for another year, maybe forever. However the brand that sells My Dress has now finally sold out of the specific style, color, and size that I wear, which has me in a bit of a panic. But I feel I have another year left of wear in these items before I need to go on the hunt for the next dress Holy Grail. And who knows, maybe I\u2019ll like whatever that dress is even better. All I know for sure is that I\u2019ll still be just as happy knowing I won\u2019t have to choose anything else.

When it comes to story in video games, at best there\u2019s an illusion of choice. At worst, there\u2019s no choice at all. In our work, we tried to say, Well, pal, you really don\u2019t have a choice. So let\u2019s see if we can use that concept to mess with your head. And hence was born the \u201cWould you kindly\u201d moment in BioShock, a moment in video game history primarily remembered for reminding us that, when it comes to player choice in narrative, our medium is limited indeed. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I think lots of games have choice. They just aren\u2019t the games you think of as story games: Civilization, XCOM, Minecraft. It\u2019s true that a kind of narrative forms in those amazing games. But it doesn\u2019t bear a lot of resemblance to traditional narrative, the kind you see in novels, plays, movies, and TV shows. And as much as I love them I don\u2019t believe games like Dragon Age, even with their branching paths and complex dialogue trees, offer truly player-driven narratives. Yes, there are a wide range of states the story can end up in, and a number of choices the player has, but those states pale in comparison to the number of states the gameplay exists in, meaning how many combinations of weapons, powers, characters, and so on you can control. So two years ago, I started thinking about how to build a system to let story be as variable as gameplay and still be awesome in the way story can be awesome. Could you have characters, conflicts, and dialogue that could end not in 100 states, not in 1,000, but in X to the Y states? Goodbye linear, hello geometric! And that\u2019s the new big thing that my colleagues and I have been working on at our yet-unnamed new studio. In March, I gave a talk at the Game Developers Conference about some of our ideas. We called it \u201cNarrative Legos.\u201d The goal is to make a flexible narrative that is broadly replayable and strongly adaptive to player choice. But even as we\u2019ve made huge inroads into our design, even as we work on our prototype, there are days when I wonder: Will it be fun? Is there a there there? Even if there is, will the audience give a shit? And then Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor showed up. On the most simple level, it\u2019s Arkham City meets Tolkien. You go around a map, using a fighting system nabbed from Rocksteady\u2019s amazing Batman games to take down what more or less amounts to a criminal family of orcs: first the street thugs, then the captains, and then the boss, orc Tony Soprano himself. But here\u2019s the great part. Nobody tells you how to take down this crime family. You wanna take down Lorm Metal-Beard first to undermine his master, Dharg the Black? Go to it, pal. You wanna turn Horhog the Armorer into a double agent so he backstabs his boss Goroth Caragor Tamer? More power to you, sister. As I was playing the game, I wondered, \u201cHow are they doing this? How are they letting me kill so many bosses in any order? Doesn\u2019t that break the game?\u201d And then I realized: The orcs aren\u2019t bespoke characters. They comprise dozens of bits of micro-content that can be mixed and matched to build thousands of combinations on the fly. An orc named Horhog the Armorer is actually \u201cName X the Name Y.\u201d The attributes that make up Horhog\u2019s character\u2014he\u2019s afraid of fire but angered by the sight of his minions dying\u2014are chosen from a list and assigned by the game dynamically. Even his body, his armor, his scars are attached algorithmically as the player meets Horhog on the field of battle. Horhog will even remember that the last time you met, he kicked your scrawny human ass. These orcs, and how you choose to defeat them, are the story of Shadow of Mordor. They project both real menace and an almost slapstick Grand Guignol, the love children of Sauron and Eliza Doolittle. Yes, there are traditional story elements in the game. And they\u2019re rather well handled, especially the opening sequence that shifts back and forth through past and present, joy and sorrow, life and death to establish a melancholic path for our hero to wander down. But that story pales in comparison to what the players, through the tools the game provides, build for themselves simply by playing the game. By breaking down the elements of character into small chunks and re-combining them based on randomness and, more important, responses to the player\u2019s choices, Shadow of Mordor tells a story that could never exist in another medium. If the audience could somehow change a plot point in Death of a Salesman, the narrative would break. If they could change something in BioShock Infinite, the story would break. But you can change the narrative in Shadow of Mordor\u2014kill an important character, fail an important mission\u200a\u2014\u200aand the story heals itself, because the system can create new characters on the fly. It does so without a \u201cgame over\u201d screen or a request for the player to try again. Players can choose their own paths, not by selecting from a list of three or four predetermined options, but by making decisions in an endlessly combinatorial gameplay system. It\u2019s chess meets Hamlet. Okay, maybe not Hamlet. But it\u2019s a start. There are two games that really kicked off what we think of as the modern \u201copen world\u201d game: Super Mario 64 and Grand Theft Auto III. These games unshackled the player from linear progression through a game\u2019s levels. I think Shadow of Mordor is the first \u201copen narrative\u201d game. You\u2019re not just checking off missions in a variable sequence. You\u2019re changing the dramatis personae. Whenever you succeed or fail, the characters in the story respond to your actions, and not in the manner of a branching \u201cchoose your own adventure.\u201d It is an excessively simple, yet impressively flexible, crime story. I\u2019m grateful to Shadow of Mordor, not only as a gamer, but also as a designer and writer. Yes, these are baby steps toward realizing the kinds of stories that games can uniquely provide. But the first steps are often the hardest of all.

On Jan. 22, CBS San Francisco obtained a letter allegedly written by John Anglin, the convict who escaped from Alcatraz in 1962 with his brother, Clarence, and another prisoner named Frank Morris. The three men are the only people in history who escaped from Alcatraz and are still unaccounted for, the U.S. Marshal for the Northern District of California, Donald O\u2019Keefe, told OMGFacts through a spokesperson. The FBI has claimed for decades that the men drowned, supposedly carried out to sea by the powerful riptides of San Francisco Bay. But the letter\u200a\u2014\u200awhich the man claiming to be Anglin reportedly sent to the San Francisco police back in 2013 (we\u2019re still not sure why it wasn\u2019t made public earlier, though the reason is, presumably, police secrecy)\u200a\u2014\u200atells a different story. \u201cMy name is John Anglin. I escape [sic] from Alcatraz in June 1962 with my brother Clarence and Frank Morris,\u201d the letter says, according to CBS SF. \u201cI\u2019m 83 years old and in bad shape. I have cancer. Yes we all made it that night but barely!\u201d Anglin goes on to propose a deal to the cops: \u201cIf you announce on TV that I will be promised to first go to jail for no more than a year and get medical attention, I will write back to let you know exactly where I am. This is no joke\u2026\u201d Unfortunately the feds didn\u2019t take him up on it. Here\u2019s what did happen, though, according to the U.S. Marshals, which is the only federal agency still actively working to track down the three fugitives. The San Francisco police sent the letter to the U.S. Marshals, who forwarded it to the FBI for a forensic handwriting analysis. The FBI, somewhat maddeningly, said the results of that analysis were \u201cinconclusive\u201d and didn\u2019t give any more information. O\u2019Keefe, the U.S. Marshal, said the agency doesn\u2019t have any other leads to follow up on. But he said the case is still open and will stay open \u201cas long as the possibility exists that any of the three are alive.\u201d In his letter, the man claiming to be Anglin says Morris died in 2008 and his brother Clarence passed away in 2011. \u201cJohn\u201d says he\u2019s living in southern California, which, if it\u2019s true, would mean the cops have done a pretty crappy job of finding him. Anglin\u2019s been an American legend for more than half a century: The media, both nationally and internationally, has breathlessly covered the escape story for decades. In 1979, a hit movie about the escape was released, starring Clint Eastwood. John and Clarence Anglin were born in the early 1930s to a poor Southern farming family. The brothers quickly developed a taste for crime. When they were in their 20s, they were arrested for robbing banks and thrown in prison. They spent time in several Southern cellblocks. Eventually, they were transferred to Alcatraz after trying to escape from the maximum security facility where they were being held in Atlanta. Alcatraz, which is surrounded by strong, cold ocean currents, was supposed to be inescapable. The Anglin brothers met Frank Morris in jail\u200a\u2014\u200apossibly at Alcatraz, possibly in Georgia; no one really knows\u200a\u2014\u200aand soon hatched an elaborate escape plan. Morris was the mastermind: He had an IQ higher than 98% of the population and clearly knew how to use it to his advantage. The three convicts\u200a\u2014\u200aplus a fourth, Allen West, who got stuck crawling through a hole in the wall on the night of the escape and ended up testifying to all these juicy details you\u2019re about to hear\u200a\u2014\u200aused kitchen spoons and a homemade drill made from a vacuum cleaner to open air vents in their cells, which led to an unguarded utility corridor behind the cell block. Then, the men set up a workshop on the roof of their cellblock, still inside the building, where they could work in private, in the middle of the night, on their plan. The four men spent months plotting, and finally, on June 11, 1962, they sprung into action. They\u2019d built dummy heads out of a homemade papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 mixture of toilet paper, soap and water\u200a\u2014\u200awith real hair from the prison barbershop\u200a\u2014\u200awhich they placed on their pillows to fool the guard who made the night rounds into thinking they were sound asleep. Then they climbed a ventilation shaft to the roof of the building, hauling a bunch of gear with them, including a homemade raft they\u2019d made by stitching dozens of raincoats together. (They later inflated the raft with an accordion-like instrument called a concertina, which they\u2019d taken from a fellow prisoner.) They had homemade paddles they\u2019d built from plywood to paddle the raft across the dark channel to the mainland. It was about 10pm when the three men emerged onto the prison roof, stole to the edge of the building and slid down a stovepipe to the ground four stories below. From there, they climbed a pair of barbed wire fences, made their way to the shore\u200a\u2014\u200aout of sight of the guard towers and rifle turrets\u200a\u2014\u200aand shoved off into the bay. Prison guards didn\u2019t notice the men were gone until morning. They launched a huge manhunt that turned up nothing but a couple pieces of the raft and a paddle on nearby Angel Island. According to West, the prisoner who got stuck in his air vent, the plan was to steal a car once they reached the mainland. But the plan might not have involved a car theft at all: In an interview with \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Wanted\u201d in the early 1990s, a former Alcatraz inmate, Thomas Kent, claimed Clarence Anglin\u2019s girlfriend was going to pick up the prisoners and drive them to Mexico. In the 55 years since the escape, all kinds of leads, rumors and stories have emerged about the men\u2019s whereabouts. In 2011, an 89-year-old guy in Georgia, Bud Morris, told a local news station that he was a cousin of Frank Morris, that he\u2019d personally delivered envelopes of cash to a prison guard at Alcatraz and that he\u2019d met with Frank in a park near San Diego after the escape. In 2016, the Anglin family showed a photo to 11 Alive, a news outlet in Atlanta, that they claimed was of John and Clarence in Brazil. The family had been given the photo by an international drug smuggler named Fred Brizzi, who\u2019d known the Anglins as a kid. None of these leads have gone anywhere, according to the U.S. Marshals. But tons of people think the escape was successful. After all, why would the case remain open if authorities didn\u2019t think the three convicts might still be alive? The Anglin letter from last week seems to support the idea that the fugitives succeeded that cold night over a half century ago. Of course, the other possibility is that whoever helped the three convicts escape that night, whoever helped them re-settle into society with aliases, is keeping their mouth shut. As Jeff Harp, a former FBI special agent, told CBS San Francisco: \u201cThey\u2019re getting up there in age, someone knows [where they are], \u2019cause if they made it out they communicated with somebody, so somebody somewhere knows\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s still alive.\u201d By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

As a young girl, Yokia would come home to find her mother and grandmother high or drunk, surrounded by men, whose status\u200a\u2014\u200afriends or johns or dealers\u200a\u2014\u200awas never very clear. Betty liked pornography and kept an abundance of it around the house. She also liked to be naked. \u201cBetty\u2019s the one who told me what the birthday suit was,\u201d Yokia told me recently. \u201cI\u2019m little and grandma\u2019s like, \u2018I got my birthday suit on,\u2019 and I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s her birthday. Then I get older and I\u2019m like, oh shit, grandma walking around naked, high, tripping. They had pornography around, just whatever, pornography, dicks, men, kids, just no respect.\u201d Betty was in her late 40s when she died. Geraldine passed away in 2005, at the age of 47. \u201cShe sat down and said she wasn\u2019t feeling good,\u201d Yokia said. \u201cFifteen minutes later she was dead. That was her life.\u201d Yokia is a tall woman with tightly cropped hair and strong features. One afternoon not long ago, I joined her at the home of her great-great-aunt, Martha Ann, who has lived in the same clapboard house in East Oakland, California\u200a\u2014\u200aon the other side of the city from Yokia\u2019s childhood home\u200a\u2014\u200afor over 60 years. Yokia opened a metal security gate and ushered me in. We had met before, but this was the first time I had seen her at home: she had left her boyfriend of 15 years a few months earlier and was now living with Martha Ann. \u201cI was getting really anxious about seeing you,\u201d Yokia confessed. \u201cI was getting paranoid again. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, I was thinking all kinds of crazy things.\u201d When we last spoke, Yokia had said that she was often depressed and anxious. She had a hard time controlling her feelings. Her thoughts raced. Sometimes she felt suicidal. Before I could say anything, Yokia wandered off into a back room to fetch Martha Ann. A frail African American woman with very light skin and a few white whiskers on her chin emerged. She sat down across from me at her dining room table. Martha Ann is 104 years old, but she remembers the chaotic environment in which Yokia grew up, and from which she had to protect her when things got bad. \u201cThat whole family, they was just crazy,\u201d she said, running her thin hands over the floral-patterned linoleum that covered the table. I asked Martha Ann about the history of violence in her family. She began to twitch and fidget. Yokia was standing by the wall. \u201cSee that?\u201d she said, pointing at Martha Ann. \u201cJust talking about it makes her stressed out. I know what that looks like: that\u2019s what\u2019s going on with her right now.\u201d Martha Ann struggled with the memories at first, but eventually they began to float to the surface. As they did, a pattern appeared. Both women agreed that Yokia\u2019s mother was a \u201chot mess\u201d. She would physically fight people\u200a\u2014\u200amen, women, she didn\u2019t seem to care\u200a\u2014\u200aand would fly into rages with little warning and no apparent reason. Martha Ann thought there was \u201cevil\u201d in Betty too. \u201cThere was something wrong with her,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it was, but there was something wrong.\u201d Betty\u2019s mother, Yokia\u2019s great-grandmother, was no better, she added. Martha Ann described Yokia as a clever child who made an effort to shake off her home life. She went to school and stayed away from drugs. But even as she tried to break away from the patterns she saw in her mother and grandmother, she found herself repeating them. By the time Yokia was 16, she was a mother herself. Eventually she left her first child\u2019s father, who was a drug dealer, and moved in with another man: they had four children together. At the same time, she started abusing alcohol, like her mother and grandmother before her. She suffered regular panic attacks and contemplated suicide. \u201cThe whole time I\u2019m trying not to be like the family. I know that this is not the way, but I\u2019m still\u2026 it\u2019s still on me though,\u201d Yokia said, wriggling her hands as if trying to shake off a cobweb. \u201cIf I decide to drink on a Friday I\u2019m gonna drink, I\u2019m gonna go crazy, but I would go really crazy, I\u2019d start crying, I\u2019d start talking about my childhood, and people were like, what is wrong with this girl? I acted a lot like my mother.\u201d As she grew older, Yokia wondered why she couldn\u2019t break the pattern. \u201cI can\u2019t really shake some of this behavior, it\u2019s like a ghost,\u201d she said. \u201cThe ghost, it\u2019s in my being. No matter what. I could fucking win the lottery today, but that ghost is still there. It\u2019s like it\u2019s out to kill me.\u201d IN THE SUMMER OF 2008, a group of scientists at McGill University in Montreal began looking at a series of brain samples. The samples had been assembled by Gustavo Turecki, a psychiatrist who for several years had been collecting the brains of people who had committed suicide. Turecki also had detailed records of each of the donors\u2019 lives. Some of the suicide victims had hanged themselves; others had taken overdoses or used a firearm. Their brains were stored at -80 \u00baC. Turecki picked out 36 samples for analysis, several of which were from people who had been abused as children. He also put together a separate cohort of brains of victims of accidental deaths, mostly car crashes. Then he took pinprick-sized samples from each, drawing the tissue from the hippocampus, a curving, elongated area of the brain that sits deep below the surface and handles memory and learning. Turecki worked with Michael Meaney, a colleague of his. Meaney, an amiable-looking man with slightly hooded eyes, was beginning a series of studies on the biological impact of childhood trauma. He already knew of studies that showed that victims of physical or sexual abuse are more likely to take their own lives as adults. He\u2019d also read papers that described how childhood abuse can damage a person\u2019s ability to handle stress. These results could be explained away by emotional trauma, of course, but Meaney wanted to know if any biology was involved. How does the toxic impact of childhood abuse live on in a person? Why does it cause some to commit suicide? The answer, he thought, might be hidden in the brains of the suicide victims. Meaney had his eye on one particular molecule. The glucocorticoid receptor is one of the basic building blocks of our stress response system. It\u2019s a protein that helps us control the hormones that cause stress: the more of the receptor we have, the better we\u2019re able to respond to stressful situations. The reverse is also true: low receptor levels are associated with disorganized, chaotic responses to stress. What\u2019s more, Meaney knew that levels of the receptor could be influenced by upbringing\u200a\u2014\u200aat least, experiments had shown that was the case in rodents. By disrupting the maternal bond between a female rat and her young, researchers had already shown that poor parenting can cause young rats to have fewer glucocorticoid receptors. And when they grow up, those same rats coped badly with stress. Meaney wondered if something similar might be happening in humans. When the analysis was complete, Meaney saw an intriguing pattern. For the most part, the brains of suicide victims had similar receptor levels to those of people who had died in accidents. But in the samples from victims of childhood abuse, receptor levels were lower\u200a\u2014\u200ajust as with the rats. When he homed in on the cause of the difference, things got even more interesting. Meaney discovered that the gene for the receptor was covered by a chemical blanket that effectively silenced it\u200a\u2014\u200aexactly the same silencing mechanism as seen in the rats that suffered poor maternal care. The implication was significant: an abusive childhood might turn the volume down on this vital stress-response gene, leaving the abused vulnerable to stress, and perhaps suicidal impulses, later in life. I spoke with Meaney earlier this year, and he recalled the moment when he looked through the microscope and realized what was happening. \u201cI remember this very warm feeling that came over me,\u201d he said. Meaney had successfully revealed a biological basis for what most people had until then consigned to the realm of social science\u200a\u2014\u200aa link between childhood abuse and suicide. Meaney\u2019s study was a landmark moment in a field known as epigenetics, a line of study that is changing our understanding of the links between childhood experiences and adult behavior. His focus was suicide, but epigenetics is revealing that a slew of behaviors, from depression and other mental illnesses to aggression and perhaps even crime, may be shaped by chemical imprints laid down in the cells of people who suffer traumatic childhoods. It\u2019s an area of research that, as a recent article in Nature put it, provides \u201ca molecular middle ground in the centuries-old debate over nature versus nurture\u201d. It may even tell us why families like Yokia\u2019s have endured so many generations of chaos. The focus of the field is something scientists call the \u201cepigenome\u201d, a medley of chemical interactions that take place around our DNA. (Epi means \u201cabove\u201d or \u201cbeyond\u201d in Greek.) Our genes are the foundation of our biological inheritance, and they govern some of our potential to grow to a certain height, or to succumb to a particular disease. The epigenome helps determine how that potential is realized. It can turn off one gene and enhance the activity of another, shaping the behavior of our cells in the process. If our genes are our hardware, the epigenome is the software that runs on top, the instructions that govern how our genes behave. These instructions are written in a chemical code that we\u2019ve only just begun to decipher. One of the simplest and best-understood parts of that code is the instruction to silence a gene. When Meaney examined the brains of the abuse victims, for example, he found that many of their glucocorticoid receptor genes had been covered with a chemical blanket, known as a methyl group, that shut the gene down. Deprived of an important cog in the machinery for reducing stress, the abuse victims may have been more vulnerable to suicidal thoughts. And, at least in animals, parental neglect can prompt gene-silencing methyl groups to cover similar stretches of DNA. The terrible effects of childhood abuse are already clear to us. What epigenetics promises is an understanding of how these effects are carried within victims as they become adults. It suggests that the world we grow up in doesn\u2019t just teach us how to behave: our environment also helps fashion chemical instructions that influence the activity of our genes for the rest of our lives. It suggests that these instructions may be a ghost in the human machine. They may even be Yokia\u2019s ghost. DOGTOWN, THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE YOKIA grew up, spans just a few blocks across. It sits at the western edge of Oakland, near the city\u2019s port and the shore of the San Francisco Bay. The area is home to some of the oldest Victorian homes anywhere in California\u200a\u2014\u200aholdovers from a century ago, when the First Transcontinental Railroad had its terminus there, and a golden era of African American prosperity was rooted in its streets. During World War II, thousands of migrant workers fled poverty and persecution in the Deep South and moved to Oakland, where they found work in the booming shipyards. But when the war ended, so did the work. The economy stagnated and the neighborhood began to decay. Old homes were torn down as city managers made way for public housing projects, a sprawling post office warehouse and a new rapid transit system. By 1979, when Yokia was born, swathes of West Oakland were pockmarked by empty lots and abandoned buildings. The post-war population of over 200,000 had shrunk to well under 50,000. Poverty, unemployment and alcoholism were on the rise. It was around this time, said Oakland residents, that the neighborhood gained its nickname, as police on patrol noticed how many dogs were roaming the deserted streets. Crack hit Dogtown in the early 1980s. It moved through the dilapidated Victorians and the projects like a virus, pulling apart families as it spread. Geraldine, who eventually had six children, was already an alcoholic when Yokia was born\u200a\u2014\u200abut it wasn\u2019t until later that she graduated to crack. Her subsequent children, like Yokia\u2019s brother Johnny Sloan, were born while she was using on a regular basis. The extended family\u200a\u2014\u200aone of Geraldine\u2019s sisters had 12 children, another three\u200a\u2014\u200alived nearby, in the midst of a drug epidemic. \u201cThe police were at our house at least once a week for something,\u201d recalled Yokia. \u201cWe had to survive, really survive. Food, school, everything was survival. All the adults were drunk or high, and not available to take care of us.\u201d As Dogtown crumbled around Yokia\u2019s family, scientists and policymakers debated why violence persisted there and in other low-income neighborhoods. Many chalked up stories about families like Yokia\u2019s to what\u2019s called \u201clearned behavior\u201d: they argued that people in communities stricken with violence and crime repeated the patterns they saw around them. Some argued that salvation lay in pulling oneself up by one\u2019s bootstraps. Others emphasized the need for outside support for troubled communities, perhaps through better job opportunities or community-focused policing. But for both groups, the cycles of dysfunction that wrecked Yokia\u2019s childhood were essentially sociological problems. A third group, however, took a different angle. They looked at families like Yokia\u2019s, in which men and women from multiple generations have been jailed for violent acts and drug use, and saw something different: evidence for a genetic basis for criminality. This was far more controversial, not least because such claims carry the taint of eugenics, the Victorian-era theory used to justify the forced sterilization of the mentally ill and criminals. Yet in recent decades, the distinction between modern genetics and eugenics has sharpened. Slowly, the taboo against the discussion of links between genes and crime has faded. Scientists aren\u2019t searching for a \u201ccrime gene\u201d, nor do they believe that race plays a role in the link. But many think that some parts of our DNA help shape aggression, and, by extension, some crime. Epigenetics is where these twin spheres of inquiry\u200a\u2014\u200abiology and sociology\u200a\u2014\u200ahave started to overlap. Thanks to the work of Meaney and others, many researchers now believe that the neglect and fear that pervaded the Mason household will have left a powerful chemical imprint in the cells of Yokia and her siblings. If the scientists are right, we may have to change the way we think about tackling violence and crime. And if the newer claims emerging from these same researchers are also correct, we may have to accept something even more disturbing: that the trauma written into the cells of the people of Dogtown may be inherited by their children. \u201cWe\u2019re used to thinking of inheritance as DNA focused,\u201d says Frances Champagne, a neuroscientist at Columbia University in New York. We know that the toxic effects of childhood trauma can change lives, and that those effects can spill over into future generations. But the process has been seen as social. \u201cWhat\u2019s being realized now,\u201d says Champagne, \u201cis that it\u2019s biological.\u201d Today, Dogtown and its surrounding neighborhoods contain some of the most dangerous blocks in America. Along with similarly impoverished areas on the eastern side of downtown, these streets are the setting for most of the 100 or more murders that occur in Oakland each year. Despite the end of the crack epidemic, crack houses can still be found dotted along the broad avenues and tree-lined streets where, in a more settled era, trolleys from the Pullman Palace Car Company once rolled. And while the neighborhood has recently seen an economic resurgence\u200a\u2014\u200adue in part to cheap homes and a new hipster culture based on local art collectives\u200a\u2014\u200aYokia\u2019s old stomping ground retains an aura of despair. THE UNIVERSITY OF ZURICH is situated close to the Swiss city\u2019s downtown. It sits near a lake, surrounded by trees and ringed by the slope of the nearby Uetliberg massif. The long shelf of the Alps lies to the south. In the autumn of 2003, Isabelle Mansuy was a young professor working at the university\u2019s Brain Research Institute. The French scientist had completed a four-year stint at Columbia University in New York a few years earlier, and had been hired by the Zurich lab to investigate memory and the long-term impact of stress. One of her early projects was to develop an animal model for borderline personality disorder. It is a condition marked by several distinct traits. Most sufferers experienced physical or sexual abuse as children. They often self-harm: some burn themselves with cigarettes, or cut themselves with razors. And while women with the disorder tend to hurt themselves, men are more prone to lash out at others. Mansuy knew the disorder ran in families, but the mechanism for transmission had not been established. So she devised an experiment using mice. \u201cNow it sounds very intuitive,\u201d she says. \u201cBut ten years ago it was not very common, and very adventurous.\u201d Mansuy began by subjecting mice to a series of ordeals that, if a human analogy can be made, might be said to generate a similarly terrible stress to that inflicted by some abusive upbringings. Her initial subjects were 40 pregnant black-six mice, a strain that is relatively smart. In the weeks after the mice gave birth, Mansuy separated the pups from their mothers for three hours every day. On its own, this would be a disturbing experience for both the parent and her young\u200a\u2014\u200abut the mothers had additional reasons for not enjoying the separation. In one test, Mansuy would take the mother away and place her in a plexiglass tube that was too small to allow movement. In another, the mothers were plunged into containers of cold water. This was intensely uncomfortable for them: mice dislike swimming and avoid entering water if they can. Mansuy\u2019s team carried out the tests at unpredictable times every day for two weeks. The intention was to stress the animals. \u201cVery serious stress indeed,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s chronic, every day for a long time, and it\u2019s very severe because it\u2019s unpredictable.\u201d Then Mansuy waited. She knew that the stress would cause the mothers to neglect their pups, but she was more interested in the effect it would have as the young mice matured. Three months later, she used a series of well-established tests to look for rodent analogs of human ailments such as depression. The adult mice were placed into containers of cold water\u200a\u2014\u200athe same containers their mothers were held in three months earlier. A mouse will naturally start to swim in such situations, seeking the edge of the water and a route out. It will fight and climb to escape. But if it can\u2019t, the mouse will eventually realise its efforts are futile, give up and begin to float. The key measurement here is how much time this takes: happy mice seek a way out for longer than depressed ones. Another test involved something else that mice detest: being hung from their tails. A typical mouse will struggle for a minute or more, but depressed mice give up after only a few seconds. Mansuy also looked at social behaviors, by introducing the animals to \u201cnovel peers\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ain other words, mice they didn\u2019t know. In normal circumstances, the arrival of a fresh face prompts some cautious exploration: the mouse sniffs around the newcomer, gradually learning to recognize its new companion. A depressed mouse, by contrast, shuffles into a corner like a terminally shy party guest. If the depression is severe, the animal may even fail to recognize that there is another mouse present at all. On every test, Mansuy\u2019s mice betrayed their troubled start to life: in the water they began to float almost immediately; when dangled by their tails, they hung listlessly and refused to struggle; placed with new peers they seemed uninterested, almost unaware. Mansuy was searching for clues as to how borderline personality disorder passes through families, so she decided to see whether the impact of the stress might extend beyond the generation exposed to it. She took the male pups from the stressed group, and mated them with a fresh, happy batch of black-six females. This time, neither the mothers nor the pups were subjected to any stress. The mothers reared their pups communally, as they do in nature. Then Mansuy put the young mice through the same series of behavioral tests. She remembers having a feeling of excitement in the pit of her stomach as she awaited the results, and when they arrived they were as she had anticipated: the mice showed exactly the same patterns of depression and socially-altered behavior, and to the same degree as their stressed fathers\u200a\u2014\u200adespite never having been exposed to stressful situations directly. Even so, Mansuy checked again. She mated the males with a different batch of new females and reared this third generation as she had the second. Again the offspring showed the same patterns. And when Mansuy dissected the brains of the stressed mice afterwards, she found changes in the methylation\u200a\u2014\u200athe gene-silencing process\u200a\u2014\u200ain areas of the brain related to stress response. More recently, she found similar patterns in the brains of the offspring of those mice. The mice had inherited a chemical imprint of their parents\u2019 stress, as well as a behavioral one. Last year, a group of researchers based at another Swiss center produced a startlingly similar result. The team was led by Carmen Sandi, a lab head at the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne and a friend of Mansuy\u2019s for several years. Sandi was interested in violence that occurs within relationships. Many researchers believe that violent habits are perpetuated by children observing\u200a\u2014\u200aand learning from\u200a\u2014\u200aadults who act in the same way. Others think that cultural patterns, including the dominance of men in many societies, legitimize aggressive male behavior. Sandi didn\u2019t necessarily disagree, but she thought that biology might also be part of the story. Like Mansuy, Sandi started by traumatising her subjects, which in this case were rats. Each received a double dose of fear. In one test, she put male rats in a cage containing a synthetic version of a chemical found in fox feces. There is no human equivalent to this test, but, if you want to imagine one, consider what it would be like to believe that a tiger the size of a bus was about to enter the room. In the second test, Sandi placed the rodents on an elevated platform three feet above the ground\u200a\u2014\u200aa virtual skyscraper for rats, who fear both heights and open spaces. These tests were conducted at random over a period of seven days: some days the rats experienced both, other days only one. The trauma induced by the tests turned the rats into terrible partners: they were excessively aggressive towards their female cage-mates, even when those females displayed submissive behavior, which would normally be enough to placate the males. More disturbingly, Sandi saw the same behavior in the offspring of those pairings\u200a\u2014\u200aeven though these rats never met their violent fathers, who were removed from the nest before birth, and despite receiving what appeared to be typical care from their mothers. These are unsettling results. Both Mansuy and Sandi found that animals can inherit the chemical imprints of stress experienced by their parents, even if they had never been stressed themselves. If humans can also inherit epigenetic marks, we may have to accept that childhood abuse doesn\u2019t just damage those who suffer it; it also impacts the brains and bodies of victims\u2019 children, and perhaps their children\u2019s children. If so\u200a\u2014\u200aand there is much work to be done before we can draw such a conclusion\u200a\u2014\u200aepigenetic inheritance may be part of the reason why families like Yokia\u2019s have experienced multiple generations of crime and child abuse. At home, pondering the results, Mansuy turned to history for inspiration. She spent an entire Sunday reading manuscripts written by the 18th-century scientist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck\u200a\u2014\u200athe father of a simple, but very controversial idea: that acquired characteristics could be inherited. Lamarck believed that traits developed in one\u2019s own life, through environment, industry or experience, could be passed on to one\u2019s offspring. As Darwin\u2019s theory of natural selection gained traction, the concept of \u201cacquired characteristics\u201d started to decline in popularity. It was further discredited, at least by association, when Soviet agriculturalists of the Stalin era claimed that they could use Lamarck\u2019s theory to improve crop yields, an application that had disastrous effects on food production. Among modern scientists, \u201cLamarckism\u201d is almost a shorthand for a failed theory. \u201cSome people still hate him today,\u201d says Mansuy. Yet Lamarck\u2019s ideas had been in the back of her mind as she carried out the mouse studies. As she read the manuscripts, written in old French, she became increasingly excited. \u201cThe feeling I had in reading those old monographs was that he was so right, he was right.\u201d IN 1993, WHEN YOKIA MASON was 13, her older brother Melvin Jr. moved back to Oakland. The two had grown up in the same house, but Yokia was upset by his return. This was because his absence had been enforced: by his early teens, Melvin had become involved in Dogtown\u2019s street life of drugs and violence, and a court had intervened and sent him to a boy\u2019s home in Fresno, a three-hour drive away in California\u2019s Central Valley. Melvin was banned from setting foot in Oakland, and the move altered his trajectory in just a few months. Six feet seven inches tall and athletic, he excelled at basketball and quickly managed to score a sports scholarship to a local university. But the court order expired when Melvin was 18 and, with freedom handed to him, he decided to return to Oakland. Within days he picked up the life he had left behind, and within weeks he was arrested for possession of drugs. The arrest cost Melvin his basketball scholarship and earned him a two-year prison term. He served his time, but once he was released the life wouldn\u2019t let go of him. Shortly after getting out, he was standing at a bus stop when he was robbed and shot in the neck, paralyzing him from the waist down. He spent half a decade recovering, eventually learning to use his hands and arms again. As his condition improved, he moved into an assisted living home and from there got his own apartment. \u201cSo Melvin gets out and goes into Oakland and gets an apartment right in the hood, and everything is running together,\u201d Yokia told me. She spoke quickly, as if she was trying to keep pace with everything she wanted to say, but struggled to express. \u201cHe\u2019s living there in the hood and somehow he could not be washed of that mentality, so the other street guys they like him, and my mom\u2019s not helping him\u200a\u2014\u200ashe\u2019s drunk and still smoking crack, getting beat up, going in and out of whatever she doing\u200a\u2014\u200aand he\u2019s having to call the police on her, and so my youngest brother\u2026\u201d Yokia trailed off and went quiet for a moment. Johnny and Yokia had the same mother, but Johnny had a different father, who was in prison for murder. Johnny\u2019s paternal grandmother adopted him as a young boy and took him out of Geraldine\u2019s world, but the physical absence didn\u2019t seem to have much of an effect. By the time he was a teenager, Johnny was \u201ccrazy\u201d, said Yokia. She described him dealing drugs, fighting, stealing. His grandmother eventually sent him to a group home, where he was briefly medicated, but he continued to misbehave. \u201cIt was like, what the hell is wrong with him?\u201d said Yokia. Martha Ann, leaning over, concurred: \u201cThat boy had the devil in him.\u201d Johnny eventually served six months for robbery. When he got out of prison, he moved in with Melvin; Yokia said Melvin was the only person who could tolerate Johnny\u2019s volatility. On Friday December 2nd, 2005, 10 days after her 26th birthday, Yokia received a phone call. Melvin had been killed at home. The murderer had shot him three times, placed a pillow over his head and left. Yokia was devastated, but not completely surprised. After all, Melvin had returned to the streets, the streets had embraced him and now, she told herself, the streets had killed him too\u200a\u2014\u200ajust as she suspected they might. Johnny came over to Yokia\u2019s house the following day, and stayed there that evening. On Sunday he went to church. But when the preacher started talking to him about loss, Johnny became angry, screaming, \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me about that.\u201d He didn\u2019t stay at Yokia\u2019s house that night. On Monday morning, Yokia received another phone call. This time it was Melvin\u2019s ex-girlfriend, and she delivered some unsettling news. The police were looking for Johnny Sloan: he was the prime suspect in Melvin\u2019s murder. The police arrived at Yokia\u2019s house that same day, looking for Johnny. They left empty-handed and carried on searching his haunts, eventually finding him in a local youth shelter. After a lengthy interview at the Oakland police headquarters, Johnny Sloan admitted to killing his brother. His arraignment fell on the same day as Melvin\u2019s funeral. \u201cYou shoot your own brother\u2026and leave? Really?\u201d Yokia said, distraught. \u201cThen you spend a night at your sister\u2019s house like nothing ever happened?\u201d Telling the story had agitated her. At times the violent threads in Yokia\u2019s life seemed to make sense: she knew, for instance, that she had to face the generational patterns in her family head-on if she was to escape them. She talked about how she had tried running away, self-medicating with alcohol and drugs, until she reached a state of mental and physical collapse\u200a\u2014\u200aand realized that she hadn\u2019t gone anywhere at all. At other times, however, the sheer volume of the violence seemed to overwhelm her. She told me she felt mortally threatened by it. \u201cOnce your brother kills your brother, with family like that, who needs an enemy?\u201d she asked. \u201cI just always have this thought of what if I get killed?\u201d Yokia joined Alcoholics Anonymous four years ago. She hasn\u2019t had a drink or touched drugs since. In that time, she told me, she has come to see the toll that her traumatic childhood and her choices as an adult have had. She looks at her extended family and sees a web of murder, suicide, jail, abuse and rage. And she wonders sometimes if she will ever escape it. \u201cThere\u2019s always this, like, ghost, like I\u2019m trying to beat too many odds,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with one issue but there are so many layers. Who can overcome this and lead a relatively normal life?\u201d IN THE YEARS AFTER HER first mouse experiment, Isabelle Mansuy replicated the study more than a dozen times. Still, it took almost a decade before she was able to publish the results. Mansuy attributes the delay to the reluctance of the scientific establishment to embrace the idea of epigenetic inheritance. The delay might, of course, be due to the science itself, not the scientific establishment. There are complaints that can be leveled against advocates of epigenetics. The most significant may be that there are holes in their reasoning. Critics point out that the existence of epigenetic changes in people and animals with a history of stress does not mean that one caused the other. The connection may be there, but so far scientists have failed to trace the causal chain. Nor have they produced a full account of how epigenetic activity can be passed down a generation. And it won\u2019t be easy to do so. Epigeneticists can\u2019t recreate a traumatic childhood in the lab, and they can\u2019t take samples from the organ in which epigenetics does some of its most interesting work: the living human brain. There\u2019s also the possibility that something other than epigenetics may explain the results of Mansuy and others. Last year, an American geneticist named Eric Nestler described an experiment similar to Mansuy\u2019s, but with a clever twist. After stressing male mice, Nestler extracted their sperm and, using IVF, impregnated female mice. Because the mothers never met the fathers of their pups, Nestler had eliminated the possibility that spending even a brief time with a troubled male might be enough to damage a female\u2019s parenting skills. When he ran behavioral tests, Nestler saw only \u201cvery modest\u201d signs of depressive behavior in the offspring, not the significant changes seen in Mansuy\u2019s mice. The study doesn\u2019t disprove Mansuy\u2019s claims. There was still some transmission of behavior and, perhaps more importantly, Nestler had applied the original stress to adult mice, which may have limited the impact it had on the animal\u2019s epigenome. But Nestler\u2019s results did demonstrate how much more work needs to be done before the implications of Mansuy\u2019s work can be accepted\u200a\u2014\u200aor rejected. Even if Mansuy\u2019s mouse studies are replicated, skeptics will have at least one more question. For scientists who work with rodents, the similarities between mice and rats and humans abound. To the rest of us, such comparisons can seem bizarre: what can a pair of caged rats possibly tell us about a man who beats his wife? In fact, the two positions are not completely at odds. Rodents share many genetic, physiological and behavioral traits with us\u200a\u2014\u200aenough to have proved an extraordinarily useful way of studying humans. But they also lack so many aspects of human behavior that it\u2019s easy to over-interpret the results of rodent studies. \u201cIt\u2019s a long way from differential methylation to behavior, physical health or mental health,\u201d says Greg Miller, a psychologist at Northwestern University in Chicago. Ultimately, the claims of epigenetics need to be evaluated in humans. But working on the human epigenome is difficult, says Meaney. Epigenetic markers do not always manifest in two places in the same way, making hard and fast conclusions rare. For all of that, he believes the science will reveal that patterns of violence like those in Yokia\u2019s family are at least partially rooted in biology. \u201cDoes witnessing violence produce a stable epigenetic signal that would then influence physiology and behavior?\u201d he asks. \u201cYes, if I had to bet my house down, then yes.\u201d IF THE EPIGENOME REALLY IS the molecular manifestation of Yokia\u2019s ghost, studying it may lead to new ways of sparing others from similar demons. Meaney, for one, believes epigenetics speaks directly to how we structure our societies. For too long, he says, policymakers have intervened in places like Dogtown using reforms based on shoddy science, or even worse\u200a\u2014\u200ano science at all. Epigenetics could present a smarter alternative. \u201cWhat we need are objective predictors of who is at risk,\u201d he says. The epigenomes of people in neighborhoods like Dogtown might contain that information; we could use the results to assess the impact of the environment on residents, and to identify those upon whom it takes the greatest toll. Epigenetics could also lead to a better understanding of why people commit crime. In 1984, Richard Tremblay began tracking 1,000 kindergarten-aged boys from Montreal\u2019s poorest neighborhoods. Today, those kids are in their mid-30s and Tremblay\u2019s study is one of the longest, and largest, longitudinal experiments conducted. One of Tremblay\u2019s more surprising results is the suggestion that the peak of aggressive behavior in humans, as measured by his subjects\u2019 willingness to resort to violence, generally occurs around the ages of two and three. As soon as children gain a decent control of their muscles, their use of aggression as a problem-solving mechanism spikes. The finding cuts across much conventional thinking on violence, which holds that people learn to be aggressive, perhaps by witnessing violent events. \u201cPhysical aggression is a natural, normal response to solving a problem,\u201d says Tremblay, who is now based at University College Dublin in Ireland. \u201cAs we get older, humans learn not to aggress, rather than the other way around.\u201d (As Tremblay has noted, Thomas Hobbes made this point in 1647: \u201cAn evil man is rather like a sturdy boy, or a man of childish mind, and evil is simply want of reason at an age when it normally accrues to men by nature governed by discipline and experience of harm.\u201d) Roughly four percent of Tremblay\u2019s cohort are what he calls \u201cchronically violent offenders\u201d: people who have committed murder and other serious crimes. In 2006, Tremblay studied blood and saliva samples from this group. Several hundred genes, including some that have been linked to aggression, were marked by patterns of epigenetic activity that differed from those he saw in the rest of the group. \u201cIt looks like there is an epigenetic basis for the transmission of violence, and not only does it look like it but it makes sense,\u201d Tremblay said. It\u2019s not hard to see that such a project would generate both enthusiasm and concern. A more accurate means of honing in on the most troubled children and those at risk of committing crimes would be a boon to social services. BUT WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED whenever simple labels are proposed for complex problems. Even though epigenetics may be part of the reason why people abuse drugs or turn to crime, it almost certainly can\u2019t explain the detailed trajectory of a person\u2019s life, or their ability\u200a\u2014\u200aor inability\u200a\u2014\u200ato change its course. Yet if the field continues to attract attention, some scientists will claim that it can, just as some eugenicists claimed that genetics could explain criminality. \u201cIf the funding stream for research and services moves towards trying to classify people, then you\u2019re going to evaluate people based on their physical experiences to the detriment of not just how these people look but how they suffer,\u201d says Jaleel Abdul-Adil, a psychologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago who works with at-risk youth. There\u2019s another thorny question raised by the new science: that of responsibility. We know, for instance, that smoking during pregnancy increases the risk that a child will develop asthma. Last year, scientists working with a rat model of the disease showed the effect extends at least a generation further: the grand-pups of rats exposed to nicotine during pregnancy also suffered from lung problems. So are smoking mothers hurting their grandchildren? \u201cAnd what if my alcohol consumption affects my grand-offspring?\u201d asks Bruce McEwen, a neuroscientist at the Rockefeller University in New York. \u201cOr if the stress of one generation affects others? If you\u2019re going to pass on your life experiences to subsequent generations, what do we do as policymakers? Especially when we may not see effects of our interventions for generations. Right now we evaluate success on short term, but epigenetics tells us we need to rethink that.\u201d Yet the most immediate implication of epigenetics is less controversial\u200a\u2014\u200aand potentially far more powerful. Recent research suggests that the epigenome is less malleable later in life, and that the epigenetic marks laid down by childhood trauma are stubborn. If that\u2019s the case, we may be too late if we intervene only after epigenetics starts to influence adult behavior. \u201cThings start going wrong very early, but we don\u2019t know it, we can\u2019t observe it,\u201d says Tremblay. \u201cSo we wait\u2026then it\u2019s too late because the brain has not developed in a way that enables the individual to get control of himself.\u201d The idea that we should intervene early in a troubled life is not a new one. When I asked Tremblay about the policy implications of epigenetics, he cited the importance of having nurses visit families at home to advise on health and parenting\u200a\u2014\u200aan idea that is over a century old and known to bring about real health benefits. \u201cThe interventions are quite simple,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we know that, and have known that for a long time.\u201d The problem, he noted, was a reluctance to pay for those nurses. If epigenetics becomes more widely accepted, the field\u2019s first contribution could be a renewed interest\u200a\u2014\u200aand perhaps funding\u200a\u2014\u200afor an old idea. Gary Slutkin is an American epidemiologist who spent much of his early life studying infectious diseases in places like Somalia and East Africa. He now works in Chicago for Cure Violence, an organization he co-founded in 1995. Slutkin sees epigenetics as a tool that can help a new generation of health workers to intervene to prevent violence\u200a\u2014\u200ain his language, to become \u201cinterrupters\u201d. \u201cCommunities need more intervention, they need more care,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s analogous to going to Bangladesh, where there are certain communities that have more diarrhea. So they need the intervention more. In Bangladesh, you need more training about oral rehydration and improving sanitation. For violence, you need more interrupters, that\u2019s the new health worker.\u201d The results of epigenetics should force a broader rethinking of violence, Slutkin added. \u201cIf we look at it this way, we\u2019re able to take it out of the realm of morality. We used to think of people with leprosy as bad people because we didn\u2019t understand what was happening. Epigenetic damage is invisible, and neuronal circuits are invisible\u200a\u2014\u200aso until we start to talk about violence as science we\u2019re still in the Middle Ages.\u201d As scientists debate epigenetics and the possibility it may help us change lives, the stresses in Yokia Mason\u2019s life continue, as if they spring from a never-ending font. Her most recent fear involves Brianna, her 16-year-old daughter. Yokia has tried to raise Brianna with a degree of awareness and conscientiousness her own mother never showed. When Brianna was a girl, Yokia moved her family from Oakland to the more peaceable towns of San Lorenzo and San Leandro, just far enough south of the city proper to feel like an escape. Yokia made sure her daughter went to good schools and surrounded herself with upwardly mobile people. Yokia now has a job as an outreach worker at a local public health office. Working there has allowed her to educate herself about the traumas of her early life and what she can do to mitigate their effects on her and her family. And yet there are days when Brianna terrifies Yokia. Some of this may be the angst and upheaval of teenage life. But some of it, Yokia is convinced, is not. \u201cI\u2019ve had to call the police on her at my house because she hit the window, I mean, hit the walls, put holes in the walls, and I get scared,\u201d Yokia told me. \u201cI see my little brother Johnny Sloan in that behavior. So it\u2019s like, oh my god, she gonna kill me?\u201d Martha Ann has also expressed concerns about Brianna, telling Yokia that the girl was \u201ccrazy\u201d. And the other side of Brianna\u2019s family is as troubled as Yokia\u2019s. Brianna\u2019s father, Yokia\u2019s first partner, has been in and out of prison for most of his life. His mother is also in prison, serving a 79-year sentence for bank robbery. \u201cThat was her career,\u201d Yokia quipped. Outside Martha Ann\u2019s house, the heavy beats of a car stereo thumped as the vehicle drove slowly past, turned the corner and disappeared. Martha Ann looked up. A thin shaft of light streamed in through a small, round hole in the front door. She raised a long finger and pointed, and Yokia explained that a stray bullet had torn through the house several years ago. The two women spent a couple of minutes recalling the event, describing where each had been when the bullet entered and where it had ended up\u200a\u2014\u200astuck in the wall above Martha Ann\u2019s head. I looked up and saw the hole was still there, a thick, dented smear in the drywall that no one was going to fix. \u201cI feel like a time bomb,\u201d Yokia said, \u201cI do. I don\u2019t know why I don\u2019t act on it. I have a relationship with God that I work on daily. It helps me, I read the stories of the Bible. Cain and Abel. You know, this shit\u2019s been going on since the beginning of time.\u201d After a while, she added, \u201cBut I don\u2019t like that story. Who wants to be connected to that?\u201d  This story was written by Scott C Johnson, edited by Jim Giles, fact-checked by Jeffrey Gleaves, and copy-edited by Tina Lee. Nicky Barber narrated the audio version and photographs were taken by Audrey Whitmeyer-Weathers and John Orvis.

Continuing his thought we can add that a logo design is a heart of a brand identity which presents a personality of a company or a product. If you want to set the connection with the target audience and tell the story of a brand, starting with a logo would be a good choice. Today we describe visual components of a logo which are vital for compelling visual perception and also show practical cases of applying psychology of color and shapes in design for branding. To make an effective logo, designers have to consider the tiniest components which it is built of and think about the influence they will have on potential clients. The science studying the impact of various factors on human\u2019s mind and behavior is known as psychology. Knowledge of psychological principles helps to understand human aspirations and motivations which means designers can predict the possible users\u2019 reactions to the certain solutions. People may not notice but mind often reacts to visual objects affecting the emotions and behavior. In our previous articles, we described two psychology branches which study the impact of shapes and colors on people\u2019s visual perception. In short, each color and shape tends to be perceived with its own meaning, so when we look at a visual object our brain receives the certain message and reacts according to what we see. Comprehending the role of the color and shape psychology, design expert can control the meaning a logo contributes. Each component chosen thoughtfully helps people read the meaning of the logo right. The research provided by Colorcom showed that it takes only 90 seconds for people to make a subconscious judgment about a product and between 62% and 90% of that assessment is based on color alone. That\u2019s why the success of the brand strategy depends largely upon the colors chosen for the logo design. Colors are a vital factor for not only the visual appearance of products but also brand recognition. In the article Color in Design: Influence on Users\u2019 Actions we described the meanings of common colors in branding and here is a short sum up. Red. Confidence, youth, and power.Orange. Friendly, warm, and energetic.Yellow. Happiness, optimism, and warmth.Green. Peace, growth, and health.Blue. Trust, security, and stability.Purple. Luxurious, creative, and wise.Black. Reliable, sophisticated, and experienced.White. Simple, calm, and clean. The color choice shouldn\u2019t be based on the common meaning alone. Visual perception is quite individual for everyone so the color effects may be different because of the factors such as age, culture, and gender. For example, children like yellow color pretty much, but as we become adults it usually seems less attractive. Moreover, there are many cultural differences in color definition. To make sure the color will work effectively for a brand strategy, it\u2019s vital to consider the preferences of the target audience. As we already mentioned in the article devoted to the psychology of shapes, all the visual objects can be analyzed in terms of shape. People may not always notice what figures and shapes surround them still they have a great impact on our consciousness and behavior. Many years of research and tests have helped professionals to define what meaning each shape typically brings and how it can influence human perception. Let\u2019s take a closer look. Squares and rectangles meanings: discipline, strength, courage, security, reliability.Triangles meanings: excitement, risk, danger, balance, stability.Circles, ovals, and ellipses meanings: eternity, female, universe, magic, mysterySpirals meanings: growth, creativity, calmness, intelligenceNatural shapes meanings: originality, organic, balance, refreshmentAbstract shapes meanings: the duality of meaning, uniqueness, elaborate. Creating a logo, designers should work on the shapes applied as well as pay attention to the typeface chosen for the wordmark. Tubik designers have great experience in creating compelling brand signs. Let\u2019s see the logo design examples applying color and shape psychology. The logo was created for LunnScape company specializing in landscaping services to commercial properties like office and courtyard spaces, parks etc. A brand sign is presented with a mascot of a dragonfly. LunnScape company is based in Florida and the creature is a perfect representative of a regional fauna. Moreover, a logo with an insect helps customers understand the nature of the services. The dragonfly illustration has a simplified style so its wings look like flower leaves. The logo consists of several colors. Turquoise circle with a dragonfly gives a solid stamp effect and brings calming feelings. Also, the color is associated with refreshment and energy, so it creates the right mood around the brand. The wings of the dragonfly combine yellow and pink colors. Together these colors symbolize joy, warmth and a bit of sensitivity making a dragonfly look playful. The wordmark typography complements and also unveils the core brand services of the company due to the thin and elegant font. One more identity design project connected to the theme of landscape and nature was logo for Andre Landscape. The final choice was made on the combination mark presenting the mascot in clear simple forms and elegant lettering echoing the rounded shapes. Symbol resulted in a new shape combining the visual concept of a bird and of a leaf in one image based on the circle. The rounded shape is easily associated with universe and eternity, quite positive stuff to transfer the idea of professional land care. Color combination is also connected with the nature of the offered services with vibes of green and natural background. This is the brand sign for trash bin cleaning service called Binned. A logo is presented with a lettermark featuring capital B as it associates with the brand name. The lines in the letter take the shape of waves evoking a sense of water and cleanliness. The logo is followed by the wordmark of the entire brand name. The chosen font is simple yet bold which makes it look neat and reflecting the mood of a brand. The color palette includes tints of blue and green which give string associations of cleanness and refreshment. In addition, the blue color often represents some corporate images since the blue is the color of trust. It usually shows reliability, may give users calming feelings. The logo presents a self-service Chinese restaurant Reborn. The major philosophy of a brand is bringing in the modern way of automated ordering food in the restaurant industry and setting the link between traditions of healthy food and innovations. To transfer all these ideas and create the effective brand image, the red silk ribbon was featured as the initial letter in the wordmark. The ribbon creates spiral shapes which bring the feeling of creativity and innovation. Moreover, it features the slight movement showing the restaurant as a modern business which moves with times. Red is a traditional Chinese color so a logo lets customers understand the specifics of cuisine served at the restaurant. Also, red color demonstrates the confidence and youth of the service as well as contributes to better brand awareness due to its brightness. This is a logo concept for modern dance studio called Motion. The company participates in multiple directions of the dancing sphere like organizing classes and workshops, events and tournaments. The brand sign has a shape of a circle. Originally, this shape symbolizes eternity since it has no beginning or end. This way, a logo highlights the diversity of company services. Moreover, one of the common meanings for circles is motion so it perfectly reflects the brand\u2019s name. This logo concept provides the variety of color performance showing the flexibility of general brand strategy. The presented options include yellow, green, and blue colors. Yellow is a principal color which brings the warm and playful emotions. Green and blue colors symbolize balance and harmony. Another round logo was designed for OrBeat, the online platform for sharing digitized sound material like music, speech and specific sound sets on the Internet. In addition, the service has the functionality of a social network so the shape sets the association with the circle of friends. Users can create their unique playlists, leave comments, listen to the tracks online and share their sound collection with friends from other social networks. So, setting the connection with the themes of music adding dynamics to everyday life, communication and expressing the metaphor of orbit, the logo is based on rounded shapes and features the variety of shades associated with diverse content on the platform. The logo is made for the social network Whizzly showcasing talents and sharing creative projects. The mascot is a monkey which looks quite pretentious because of the sunglasses. The choice of the character can be explained by the common associations connected with this animal. Monkeys are energetic funny representatives of fauna and they know how to draw attention. Rounded forms make the image dynamic and friendly. As the brand\u2019s target audience are talented people, the monkey displays their eccentricity. The colors include the gradient of violet and blue. They are easily associated with the lights which are often used on the stage. Also, we can see the reflection of the brand\u2019s name in the sunglasses. It ensures better brand recognition. Here\u2019s the concept applying branding symbol for an app icon. It features a logo for fOxygenic, a mobile application which represents a social network for people loving the active life, open-air sports and events. As you see, the mascot is based on round shape. It may set different levels of association by the resemblance with \u201cO\u201d letter for the word \u00aboxygen\u00bb applied in the brand name, motion and active life and the circle of friends as well as in OrBeat logo. Bright warm orange color reflects not only the traditional vision of a fox coloring but also the idea of dynamic life, joy, and great mood. Moreover, the color has high visibility potential which strengthens the icon\u2019s recognizability. This is a branding sign for a music app SwitchUp with broad functionality on generating and sharing playlists. A logo features a wordmark and the form of a play button. This shape helps to set the link with the nature of the application. In addition, the keywords behind its branding are \u201cbright\u201d, \u201cdynamic\u201d, \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cpositive\u201d, the reason why the triangle is an accurate choice. The thing is that triangle is an energetic and dynamic shape which is associated with motion and direction. The color palette supplements the brand image bringing the feeling of energy and freshness. The logo concept was designed for a medical app Meditrack used by doctors for planning and organizing the flow of appointments as well as tracking and saving health data for patients. It features the stylized track sign where straight lines go up and down similar to heart rating graph. The combination of blue, light blue and red colors is often associated with health care industry so creates a professional image for a brand. The success of branding highly relates to a logo design. Considering the influence of colors and shape on human psychology, you can create compelling brand signs which set the connection with the target audience by transferring accurate messages and emotions.

Bedrooms and kitchens have their charms, sure, but neither approaches the bathroom\u2019s blend of solitude and comfort. The bathroom is where magazines are read and ideas are generated; where a modicum of privacy and a moment of respite is possible. A good bathroom break is like a small-scale spa visit\u2014a few minutes of self-care that can make the rest of the day a little more bearable. For month two of my self-bettering experiment, I\u2019m going to overhaul my bathroom\u2014testing products, speaking to experts, and adopting the latest methods to make the most of my morning ablutions. What kind of toothbrush should I be using? How should I shower? Which brand of toilet paper is best? My goal is to make my bathroom as comfortable as possible\u2014a luxurious Shangri-La retreat that will leave me coddled and rejuvenated. My quest starts with the centerpiece of any bathroom: the toilet. In his 1966 book The Bathroom, which is still considered the bible of bathroomology, Cornell professor Alexander Kira called the modern, sit-down toilet \u201cthe most ill-suited fixture ever designed.\u201d Kira believed\u2014and subsequent studies have confirmed\u2014that toilets work against our bodies by forcing us into unnatural angles when we sit down to defecate. The solution to hunched-over posture, Kira wrote, is squatting\u2014a more natural position that opens the anal sphincter, moves the body\u2019s plumbing into proper alignment, and allows us to evacuate more freely. A 2003 study published in Digestive Diseases and Sciences found that squatters took an average of 51 seconds to move their bowels, as opposed to 130 seconds for those sitting on a standard high toilet. A more recent study by a group of Japanese researchers found that \u201cthe greater the hip flexion achieved by squatting, the straighter the rectoanal canal will be, and accordingly, less strain will be required for defecation.\u201d Our caveman ancestors, in other words, had it right. I\u2019m a renter, so I can\u2019t exactly tear my toilet out of the wall and replace it with a hole in the ground. But I did figure out one way to replicate the pre-plumbing experience. I ordered the Squatty Potty, a nine-inch-tall stool ($24.99 on Amazon) that sits on the ground in front of your toilet. \u201cIt\u2019s all about basic mechanics,\u201d Robert Edwards, the CEO of Squatty Potty, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s about taking it back to the way it was done thousands of years ago.\u201d There are two ways to use the Squatty Potty, Edwards said. The easy (and recommended) way is to put your feet up on it while sitting down on the toilet, which raises your legs and simulates a shallow squat. The even more effective, harder way is to stand on the Squatty Potty and lower yourself into a deep squat, either hovering over or barely touching the seat while you do your business. I experimented with both methods for several days, and I found the hard-core one more satisfying. It makes going to the bathroom easier, and it saves time. I used to dawdle on the toilet, finishing long New Yorker articles and completing tough Candy Crush levels. But with the Squatty Potty, that\u2019s impossible. After 30 seconds of deep squatting, your quads start to burn, so you learn to finish your business, wipe, and move on. After testing the Squatty Potty for a week, I decided to venture to the other end of the comfort-efficiency spectrum. I e-mailed Brondell, a company that makes high-end toilet seats, and asked for a review model of their top-of-the-line model, the Swash 1000. The Swash 1000 ($599, Brondell.com) is a marvel of modern engineering. It has two bidet attachments (one in back, one in front for \u201cfeminine\u201d washing), a heated seat, an electric air dryer, and options for sanitizing and deodorizing your toilet bowl. I installed it on my toilet in about 10 minutes. Bidets haven\u2019t caught on in the U.S., but there\u2019s a reason they\u2019re standard in most European countries: They\u2019re cleaner and more civilized than wiping with paper alone. (Alexander Kira, the late bathroom expert, agreed: \u201cMany are prepared to complain about a tomato sauce stain on a restaurant tablecloth,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwhilst they luxuriate on a plush seat in their faecially stained pants.\u201d) The first squirt of the Swash 1000\u2019s bidet attachment shocked me\u2014I jumped off the seat in surprise. But the second and third were less abnormal. And by the fourth, I was hooked. The Swash 1000 isn\u2019t the most luxurious toilet fixture on the market\u2014that would probably be the $6,000-plus Kohler Numi toilet\u2014but it is one of the best things I can put in my bathroom without violating my lease. (A warning about the Swash 1000, though: It makes sitting on the toilet so pleasant that you\u2019ll end up staying for much longer than normal. Adjust your social calendar accordingly.) While enjoying my bidet seat, I experimented with several types of toilet paper. Consumer Reports\u2019s favorite brand, White Cloud 3-Ply Ultra Soft and Thick, is good\u2014thick, soft, not too expensive \u2014but I preferred Quilted Northern Ultra Plush, which felt like a soft chamois cloth. I also tried several other toilet accessories, such as Cottonelle wet wipes and something called the Bottom Buddy ($36.20 on Amazon), a plastic stick with a grabbing mechanism on the end that holds a wad of toilet paper and makes it possible to wipe with minimal effort. (It\u2019s meant for people with physical impairments but also works for the truly lazy.) But neither struck me as necessary, especially now that I\u2019ve got the Swash 1000. The most far-out solution I tried was based on a 2005 study by Korean researchers that found that people who received an abdomen massage using essential oils had an easier time overcoming constipation. To test this finding myself, I ordered some vials of lemon, peppermint, and rosemary oils and tried rubbing my belly with them before I went to the bathroom. I\u2019m not sure whether it helped, but it did make me smell like a Yankee Candle store for the rest of the day. We\u2019ve all heard the tooth-care orthodoxy from our dentists: Brush twice a day for at least two minutes, floss regularly, and use a pea-size amount of toothpaste. But when I dug into the science of dental hygiene, what I found was a hodgepodge of mixed findings and conflicting advice. For example, a 2010 study in the American Journal of Dentistry found that sonic toothbrushes were better at removing plaque and preventing gingivitis than regular, manual toothbrushes. But a 2013 study found that oscillating, rotating toothbrushes\u2014brushes with heads that spin in a circular pattern, rather than simply vibrating back and forth\u2014had the edge. Meanwhile, a 2011 study in the International Dental Journal \u00adfound that electric toothbrushes weren\u2019t significantly more effective than a manual brush. And a recent paper in the British Dental Journal found that, basically, nobody in the dental community agrees on anything: \u201cThere was unacceptably very wide diversity in recommendations on toothbrushing techniques and on how often people should brush their teeth and for how long,\u201d the authors wrote. Since no scientific consensus exists, I had to go by personal preference. I tested three brushes\u2014a sonic brush (Philips Sonicare HX5610/30 Essence 5600, $39.95 on Amazon), a rotating-oscillating brush (the Arm & Hammer Spinbrush, $7.99 at Target), and, last, my regular Oral-B manual brush ($9.99 for four at CVS). Of the three, I found that the Sonicare left my mouth feeling the cleanest. I\u2019m not sure, in a periodontal sense, whether it did a better job than either of the others. But I liked the brush\u2019s small head and wireless charging cradle, and the fact that it has a timer that vibrates when you\u2019ve brushed for two minutes. Toothpaste, too, is a toss-up. I tried three brands: Colgate Total Enamel Strength (the top-rated pick of Real Simple magazine), Crest Complete Multi-Benefit Whitening (the one I normally use), and a fancy, all-natural toothpaste from Tom\u2019s of Maine. Neither worked definitively better than the others, I don\u2019t think, but I liked the Colgate best, in part because it had the strongest mint flavor. (The fact that I associate a minty taste with quality means that Big Toothpaste\u2019s marketing team has done its job.) The Tom\u2019s toothpaste had a more natural, mild mint taste. But, weirdly, natural mildness wasn\u2019t what I wanted\u2014I\u2019ve been conditioned to expect a strong artificial mint aftertaste in the mornings, even if it does make my first cup of coffee taste bad. I also tried the toothbrushing method recommended by my friend A.J. Jacobs in his book Drop Dead Healthy. It\u2019s called the Modified Bass, and it involves angling the brush at 45 degrees toward your gum line, scrubbing a few times, and then rolling the brush across the surface of your teeth. And, in a less crucial improvement, I sprang for the Touch N Brush Hands Free Toothpaste Dispenser ($12.35 on Amazon), which mounts on your bathroom mirror and squeezes out the right amount of paste when you push your brush into a small divot on the dispenser. It didn\u2019t save me much time, but it did create the kind of neat toothpaste ribbons you usually see only in commercials. Unlike the men in Gillette ads, I\u2019ve never really cared whether my morning shave leaves me baby-faced or not, as long as it gets rid of visible stubble and doesn\u2019t result in too much razor burn. But this month, mediocrity wouldn\u2019t cut it. I decided to try four different methods: one with an electric razor, one with a standard cartridge, one with a safety razor, and one with a straight razor\u2014the kind you find in old-time barbershops, handled by old men with gravitas and steady hands. Electric razors are by far the most convenient of the bunch; with mine, I can erase a week\u2019s worth of hair growth in just a few minutes. But it leaves behind a light stubble. So, when I really need to get clean, I usually shave using a disposable cartridge razor\u2014specifically, the Dorco SXA5000. (Pro tip: Dorco razors are the same ones used by the Dollar Shave Club, and if you buy them in bulk, they\u2019re a lot cheaper. At $34.42 for a pack of 24 replacement cartridges, they\u2019re also roughly a third of the price of the name-brand Gillette Fusion cartridges, with no discernible difference in quality.) Cartridge shaving is fine for most people, but purists swear by the traditional \u201cwet shave,\u201d which is accomplished with a straight razor or safety razor. (Wetshaving.net, a forum for dedicated wet-shavers, asks potential converts to ask themselves, \u201cAre you the kind of man that rakes a dull hatchet across his face in front of a half-steamed mirror, grunts, and goes about his day, tying his shoes at red lights and grabbing breakfast at McDonald\u2019s on the way to work? Or are you the kind of man who has it together when he leaves the house, with that ready-for-anything attitude?\u201d) I want to be the second kind of man. So I procured a bar of shaving soap, a badger-hair brush, and two razors: a Merkur safety razor ($31.49 on Amazon) and a Parker stainless steel straight razor ($19.99 on Amazon), which looks like the kind of implement you\u2019d find in Sweeney Todd. I put the soap in a coffee mug, added warm water, and began lathering my face with the brush. I decided to shave one half of my face with each razor. I started with the safety razor, which felt like a duller, less ergonomic version of the Dorco cartridges I\u2019d been using\u2014not a huge improvement. The straight razor, on the other hand, was a frankly terrifying hair-destroyer. After inserting a blade into the handle, I gingerly dragged it over the unshaven side of my face, barely touching the hair as my mind reeled with disaster scenarios. What if I shaved too close and took off a layer of skin? What if my hand slipped, and I cut myself and bled out on my bathroom floor? The straight razor gives a close shave\u2014closer than the safety razor, even\u2014but it took me half an hour to shave half of my face, and the procedure made me so frazzled that I had to lie down afterward. If this is what real shaving is like, I think I\u2019m willing to tolerate some stubble. Design-wise, my shower is a mess. For starters, it\u2019s narrow and low-ceilinged, so I have to crane my neck to wash my hair. Like most baths, it\u2019s a tub/shower hybrid, which makes no sense given that I almost never take a traditional bath. Several of the experts I spoke to recommended ripping out the tub completely, and replacing it with a standalone shower. \u201cThe vast majority of adults prefer a large, luxurious multi-head shower enclosure and not a big soaking tub,\u201d Ellen Cheever, an interior designer who specializes in kitchens and bathrooms, told me. But, since I rent, I can\u2019t make any major alterations to my shower, so I had to make do with minor tweaks. Diana Schrage, a senior staff interior designer at Kohler, recommended that I make my shower more exciting by adding devices that make it more fun. \u201cWe spend a lot of time thinking about how many senses we want engaged,\u201d Schrage said. \u201cUsually, I start with light.\u201d Most people\u2019s showers are too dark to be fully safe, Schrage says, so on her recommendation, I put a small tap light in my shower. I don\u2019t have a grab bar for my shower, as Schrage recommended, but I do have a towel rack within reach of the tub, and I began using it to steady myself as I entered and exited the bath. Next, I attached a Bluetooth speaker (the Ivation IVA-400, recommended by tech review site Tom\u2019s Guide, $29.99 on Amazon) to my showerhead, which allowed me to listen to music while I scrubbed myself. (The speaker also has a speakerphone feature, should I ever need to bathe while on a conference call with my boss.) Playing music livened up the shower experience, but it still felt like I could be more stimulated. So I downloaded The Social Radio, an app that reads your Twitter timeline to you out loud. This way, I could improve my efficiency by reading the news while I showered, batching two important tasks into one. \u201cWall Street Journal: Family Dollar rejects increased takeover bid from Dollar General,\u201d the app read as I soaped my armpits. Cheever, the bathroom designer, warned me against tweeting from the shower, for fear that I\u2019d get distracted and hurt myself. (\u201cMusic, I applaud,\u201d she said. \u201cBut anything that has to do with reading, reacting, responding, I would strongly suggest is not a good idea.\u201d) So, after a few days with The Social Radio, I went back to using the Bluetooth speaker. Showering with a musical soundtrack is more fun than listening to tweets, and playing music allowed me to give myself a time limit. (Right now, my morning shower is two \u201cTurn Down for What\u201ds long.) I also experimented with different things to put in my hair. For shampoos, I tried Woody\u2019s Daily Shampoo and Clear Men Scalp Therapy ($19.96 and $4.49 on Amazon, respectively), both of which came recommended by shampoo-review site GetGoodHead.com, as well as American Crew, the shampoo I normally use. Of the three, Woody\u2019s was the winner. It smelled great\u2014a little citrusy, with a hint of grapefruit\u2014and it made my hair feel better and thicker than normal. I also tried three conditioners: Jack Black True Volume conditioner ($19), American Crew Tea Tree Calming Conditioner ($11.35), and Redken Finish Up Conditioner ($13.50). All three smelled good and made my hair soft, but American Crew came out slightly ahead thanks to its less aggressive scent and cheaper price. Experts generally recommend bar soap over liquid body washes, since we tend to use too much of the liquid kind, and since plastic body wash bottles are less eco-friendly than the cardboard or paper wrappers on bar soap. (One study found that liquid soaps had, on average, a 25 percent larger carbon footprint than bar soaps.) So I switched from my normal Irish Spring body wash to a Dove Men +Care Body & Face Bar ($4.49 for four). I hadn\u2019t washed with bar soap in years, but after a few days of adjustment, I found it worked just as well as the body wash. And I take pleasure in knowing that I was making up in a small way for the environmental havoc I was wreaking with my longer, music-accompanied showers. These changes made a huge difference to my shower routine. With music, added light, and improved toiletries, I found I actually looked forward to showering every day. But that, too, is an area of debate. Some experts advise showering only two or three times a week, so as not to wash away the natural oils on your skin and in your hair. In the interest of testing the full range of options, I tried going without showers for a week\u2014at Burning Man, it turns out, where my editor sent me for a story. There, in the desert, my $600 bidet seat was replaced with reeking Port-a-Potties, and I heard dubstep bass lines from the camp next door instead of a pleasant Bluetooth soundtrack. Going to the bathroom in such austere conditions was a terrible shock to my system, and I confess: My weeks of bathroom optimization may have spoiled the great outdoors for me. The minute I returned home, I put down my bags, rushed to the bathroom, closed the door, and stayed there for 45 minutes, treating myself the best I know how.

In fact, it is one of the most misused terms in the technology domain: it is often poorly referenced to describe a prototype, a demo or even the first deliverable of a project. Assuming you have this great idea\u200a\u2014\u200aa concept you believe is good enough to further analyze as a product\u200a\u2014\u200ayou need a method to start defining the product and more specifically, the subset of the product features that can serve your objectives with the minimum cost and risk. Key stages in this process are: Set the context\u200a\u2014\u200athink of the problem, the situation, the opportunity; think of what is already available in the market dealing with the same problem; identify and name the types of users involved and how they interact. Document your users, their needs, the problems they are experiencing, their expectations, and the best-possible experience they could have in your context. The Minimum in the MVP implies that you already have the big picture, you have the product vision! A common mistake is when the team \u2018easily\u2019 identifies a set of \u2018obvious\u2019 use cases as the MVP\u200a\u2014\u200awithout a clear product vision and the big picture. Having the big picture, the product vision, you need to apply a process to identify the smallest subset of functionality that serves a very specific goal: to satisfy your users while enabling critical user insights and feedback which can significantly improve the next iteration in your product development plan. The big picture can be expressed as the super-set of user stories across all the classes of users identified. It\u2019s a good idea to create a large set of epic stories: iterate across all identified users and try to define user stories covering their needs and expected benefit/ gains. Use a compact format as the one proposed in Scrum as a <user> I want to <be able to perform an activity> so that <describe the gain>. You don\u2019t have to worry about priorities at this stage. A good idea would be to name each story/ assign a compact title for easier classification and organization. As soon as you have your product feature super-set\u200a\u2014\u200athe big picture\u200a\u2014\u200ayou need to review it to ensure that it really defines a product (the P of the MVP): search for continuity, homogeneity and complementarity among your user stories. As a result of this process, you may realize that more than one related products are referenced in your backlog and need to be separated. Or you may realize that there are significant gaps that need to be filled. Again, think as a user, use empathy to identify interactions, scenarios and stories that need to be included. You need to also gather feedback so you can try to validate your stories and the product through expert advice, user interviews, formal or informal surveys or public domain references (for instance any reliable public domain statistics that can in-validate your assumptions). Thinking as a user is great\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can be creative and forget, for a moment, about real-world challenges such as technical and financial constraints: your objective is to compile the product super-set of user stories to satisfy\u200a\u2014\u200aor to even to excite\u200a\u2014\u200aall the different types of your users. Now it\u2019s time to think as an entrepreneur: you need to start considering and documenting implementation costs, priorities, strategic advantages and differentiators against competition. You need to estimate the development cost of each user story and also to quantify the expected value for the user along with the expected impact on the business: your business. The logic to identify the right minimum subset can be complex\u200a\u2014\u200arequiring estimates of all the above at the user-story level; for each user story (or Epic) you need to have at least the following: 1. The complexity / cost associated / feasibility 2. The expected value for the user Estimates of the above dimensions could be on a numerical or ordinal scale. As soon as you have those estimations you can then rank your stories and also plot them in a simple chart against complexity and expected value for the user. At this point you can start prioritising high-value, low-cost stories over lower value, costly ones. Be aware though of those natural, strong dependencies between product features. In many cases there are technical or procedural dependencies requiring certain features to be implemented first although their cost is high and the expected user value low. These dependencies need to be identified and possibly visualized in the user stories mapping. Having the above for each of the features (user stories) of your product allows you to define your MVP as: You can sort your entire product backlog by dependency sequence (start with foundation), then by the value for the user in descending order and then by complexity and feasibility in ascending. You can also combine budget constraints, team\u2019s velocity and go-to-market strategy makes it \u2018easy\u2019 to identify the red-line of your to-be-proved Viable MP. The above can be easily applied on a well-understood concept and documented in the form of a properly structured product backlog. In reality though, this will be just a draft definition of an MVP. What is needed in an ideal scenario, is feedback and validation of the features by real users via prototyping, focus groups, market research, competition analysis and related methods. The more input from real users, the more confident you can be that your product concept has all it takes to become Viable (which also assumes a great execution/ implementation/ launch).

This is a limited cognitive resource which is often seen while seeing users perform only one task adequately at a time.

Bottom up processing is when interaction is governed by sensory stimulation, like loud sounds, or bright lights. Using of visual elements in UI can be used effectively to grab attention. Banners and animations are smartly used to push information to users. The cognitive process involved in storage of information once it has been received by our senses.

Continuous rehearsal stores information in the long term, known as long term memory. This may be difficult to access depending on the situation or state of mind. As builders of products we must not cognitively overload our users with plethora of options on the interfaces we make. There is only so much that a user can consume at a point in time. Language is the cognitive process of learning, understanding and sharing of meaning. It is essential to use appropriate language in design else users will not understand how, why or what they are interacting with. Language is not only spoken or written, visual language comprises of a range of symbols that mean things to users. Product teams must ensure that a language that is understood by users is used in their products.

Problem solving involves primarily having a goal, breaking this goal up into sub-goals and then choosing a plan of action for each. Over a period of time and with enough practice this becomes automatic for users. What matters is to have the tools used to solve the problem visible. The user will normally connect the dots and initiate problem solving. This involves selection of the best possible idea from a range of ideas generated while problem solving. Normally rational there are also many subjective factors involved while making decisions. Most decision making is directed towards minimising losses. It is thus important to ensure that our products make our users feel comfortable and minimize the cost associated with actions they take. This will ensure they can move around freely.

It freaks some people out, but I had no problem. Not because I dug being stabbed by sharp objects. Not because I grooved on pain. Instead, I believe it was the surreal experience of watching the crimson juice of life flow so easily from my body, looking so healthy, all the while knowing a disease is threatening to take that life away. There was something about the contradiction that gave me comfort. What I grew to depend upon even more was the bruise left behind. That silver-dollar size, purple-black-sometimes-yellow badge that appeared afterwards and hung around for days. It was painful. It was ugly. It was impossible to hide and people saw it. I liked it. I liked it because it was something I could look down at and instantly be reminded that I was alive. I had a problem, but I was alive. So, live. After five years of this, I was told by the white coats to go away and not come back. I don\u2019t miss cancer. But I kinda miss that bruise. Why do we require reminders to tell us we are alive? People go about this in many different ways. Some rock climb or skydive to keep them awake and engaged. The constant threat of danger, the thrill provided by tempting fate tells them, \u201cI am most definitely alive.\u201d The contradiction is comforting. Athletes grow to depend upon the pain that comes after the battle. To spend hours crashing violently into their opponents on Saturday/Sunday is not enough. Winning or losing doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. A body racked and seized with pain on Monday/Tuesday is the real badge. \u201cI hurt. I can barely walk. Therefore, I am most definitely alive.\u201d But when these badges disappear or are no longer available, we become vulnerable. We search for new ways to remind ourselves that we are still alive. Some healthy, some not-so-healthy. It is when we begin to seek out our own badges, or create them on our own, that we often find not comfort, not reassurance, but problems. You would think the fact that we are alive, that we woke up this morning and watched a sunrise or got kissed and hugged by our children was enough to remind us, \u201cWe are most definitely alive.\u201d Some will say: \u201cYou don\u2019t need a badge. You don\u2019t need anything other than a splash of cold water and your own reflection in the mirror to give your life validation,\u201d and I would agree. I really did not need a painful ugly bruise in the middle of my arm to tell me anything I didn\u2019t already know. It shouldn\u2019t take standing on a mountain to remind us we are most definitely alive. It\u2019s not the view from 20,000 feet that impacts us. It is the perspective the view provides, reminding us that life is not lived on mountain tops, nor dangling from cliffs. It is acted out on flat, ordinary ground among ordinary people, working ordinary jobs, eating ordinary food. It is there, among the ordinary, that our actions become our badges. We decide every day whether our actions will be ordinary, or extraordinary. Do you wear the badge, or does the badge wear you?

The perk tree system presented in this series, and others such as Skyrim, allows a high degree of personalisation and customisability, while rewarding the experience of levelling. While selling your crates or won parts is a core functionality of the game, we also wanted to reward users who regularly battle and use the platform in order to motivate true engagement. Thus there are two forms of levels in Etherbots: Your account level allows you to accumulate experience independent of the robots you use to battle overtime. It persists with your Ethereum account and allows you to unlock rewards according to a perk tree. Maybe you want to invest in your fire perk tree, benefiting the combat capabilities of fire parts you use in battle; this could influence the way you decide to keep and sell parts after battles, too. When you battle, your parts gain a little bit of experience (and more if you win). This directly affects the combat capability of those parts. Levels are intrinsic to parts, and stay with them even when they\u2019re sold. If you collect enough parts of one elemental type or rarity, and combine them into a robot, you\u2019ll gain enhanced combat powers for that bot. Get a robot of the same type and rarity (say, a legendary golden, fire element Etherbot)\u200a\u2014\u200aand gain the highest set bonus possible. We wanted to distribute a small amount of initial parts to users in a way that was incredibly fun, fair and rewarding, and had an element of luck due to part rarity. It\u2019s hard to get a game like this started; you need to distribute robots in a fair way, and provide some sort of intrinsic reward for those who take the risk of getting in early. The entire game benefits from network effects and communal engagement, and rewarding early adopters\u200a\u2014\u200athereby turning them into advocates and fans who were with you from the beginning\u200a\u2014\u200ais one of the best ways to create a thriving community around this game. Besides, loot crates are fun (as long as you don\u2019t ruin the functionality by relying on huge amounts of microtransactions like Battlefront). Opening a satisfying loot crate literally feels like Christmas. Think about the animation of opening one up on Overwatch or League of Legends. Sure it\u2019s harder to do this in the browser than in a unity engine rendered video game, but we want you to feel incredible when you open up and find what parts you received in your crate. Also\u200a\u2014\u200aour loot crates provide you at the *very worst* with a full set of 4 parts, everything you need to create your own robot and battle. And these crates are hard-capped at 3900 to be sold, ever\u200a\u2014\u200aeven after the presale. The source code is verified on Etherscan.

In fact, it\u2019s probably fair to say that I had few entrepreneurial aspirations in general. I had a job; I had some hobbies; I attended some professional meetups. It was all\u2026pretty standard. Then, on March 31, GiveBackHack came along and punched me in the face. In a good way. In a \u201cget off your ass and do something\u201d sort of way. And now, throughout the past year, I\u2019ve felt a little like I just woke up. I\u2019ve spent most of my professional life in the call center industry. Between a soul-sucking stint in outbound telemarketing and closing that chapter of my career as a Product Manager for a call center software company, fifteen of my working years contributed to the bottom line of other businesses trying to lower the costs of interacting with their customers. Simply put, my job was to help businesses make more money. As I hopped from position to position\u200a\u2014\u200aover a dozen, in fact\u200a\u2014\u200anothing really stuck. Some of the jobs fizzled into boredom, but many offered exciting challenges to tackle and brilliant, vibrant people with whom to tackle them. But there was always something naggingly unfulfilling about the work. A few years ago I finally realized the problem: I just don\u2019t give a shit about helping businesses make more money. Of course, there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with businesses making more money, but, in all of my time in the call center industry, I just couldn\u2019t find a purpose beyond that bottom line. So I left. I went on sort of a sabbatical, doing my best to immerse myself in the culture of Columbus. My stint in Product Management had stoked my passion for software development, so I went to technology talks, meetups, and networking events to try to get a lay of the land. It was amazing and a little shocking to find such a thriving tech community right under my nose, made easily accessible mostly through the auspices of Techlife Columbus and its sponsors. I can\u2019t remember how, in 2016, I heard of GiveBackHack, but I assume now that it was through one of their newsletters. I didn\u2019t go to that one, although I wish I had. I\u2019d have known a year earlier what I know now. By February of 2017, I\u2019d been working for a software consulting company for about a year, using consulting as an opportunity to figure out where I fit into the world, still without quite hitting the mark. When the event notice for GiveBackHack 2017 hit Facebook, I bought my ticket immediately. I had no idea what I was signing up for, if I\u2019m being completely honest. I\u2019d never been to anything like a hackathon or a startup weekend, and, being mostly connected to the business side of technology and devoid of anything but the most rudimentary software development skills, I really wasn\u2019t sure how I\u2019d contribute. Regardless, I knew it would be something different\u200a\u2014\u200asomething with purpose. I mean, just read the description from the Facebook event and tell me you\u2019re not even a little intrigued: Yes. I\u2019ll have some of that, please. If you want to know what the experience was like for me, you can read all about it here: But beyond the power of the weekend, there was some kind of lasting imprint on my psyche, like some social entrepreneurial hoodoo that had somehow opened my eyes to yet another vibrant ecosystem hiding in plain sight in Columbus. As it turns out, there are scores of people in Columbus who want to be in the business of good, who want their professional lives and purpose to be intrinsically entwined. As it also turns out, I\u2019m one of them. Now, almost a year later, I\u2019ve become what I guess I would call a social enterprise geek. I left my consulting job and went to work for a company whose mission is to help people live healthier lives. I meet with nonprofits and entrepreneurs almost every single week to try to find ways I can help. When people talk to me about their business ideas or some problem they\u2019ve identified, I steer them toward sustainable social impact. I find myself constantly thinking about purpose. It\u2019s kind of funny: one of the opening talks of GiveBackHack was from Dan Rockwell of Big Kitty Labs. He led with an assertion that everyone has this entrepreneurial itch they need to scratch. I remember rolling my eyes internally at the time, thinking it was all a bit dramatic and that I really had no such itch. I was just checking out this random event. I didn\u2019t even have a tingle. Well, damn it, Dan, I guess you were right. I do have that itch, and scratching it has propelled me into a new worldview that has given me opportunities to meet and work with some of the most incredible people making Columbus one of the most incredible cities in the United States today. Interestingly enough, Dan says in his write-up: He\u2019s not kidding. A few weeks ago, I read this quote in The Startup Way by Eric Ries: He\u2019s right, and just imagine if we could apply that widely-distributed genius more to social problems as much as we apply it to economic ones. I think a lot about trying to figure out what the biggest, most imminent problem is in Columbus that we can try to tackle in an economically sustainable way. Is it access to clean water? Poverty? Income inequality? What if the biggest problem is that we just don\u2019t have enough social enterprises tackling these issues? What would happen if more and more people are given the chance to try their hand at social entrepreneurship? What would the world look like, then? And I think that\u2019s what GiveBackHack and the ecosystem that surrounds it is all about: lowering the barriers, spreading awareness, and providing entrepreneurs a true launchpad for social impact. Beware: if you go to one of their events\u200a\u2014\u200aand you really should\u200a\u2014\u200ayour brain might just be rewired like mine. But I promise you\u2019ll be in good company.

Not even close. They are dragged down by mindsets defined primarily by limits\u200a\u2014\u200ahow smart they are, how far they can go, how hard they can work, how successful they can be. Most of these limits are pretty low. \u201cIt\u2019s lonely at the top,\u201d wrote entrepreneur Tim Ferriss. \u201c99% of people are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for \u2018realistic\u2019 goals, paradoxically making them the most competitive.\u201d Most people are living far below their potential, fighting for scraps with the other 99%. They\u2019re more concerned with politics and \u201cbeating the other guy\u201d than actually achieving personal success. The power of these limiting mindsets comes from how long they\u2019ve been in use. Most people had limits impressed upon them from an early age, which they mistakenly began to believe was the true deciding factor for what they could and could not do. If you want to reach new heights, break new records, and become the best version of yourself, you must unlearn these negative mindsets. Here\u2019s how. Back when I was an emotional mess in therapy, my therapist instructed me to read David Richo\u2019s How to Be an Adult. Among the many gems I wrote down, this one was particularly powerful: \u201cUnresolved baggage from our childhood can have severe impacts on our adulthood.\u201d Outdated and archaic limits we learned as children will have severe negative impacts on our adulthood, if left unresolved. If we don\u2019t unlearn and replace them, we will continue living with the same childish limits under which we once lived. We will never experience the rich, full success of a fully matured adult. One afternoon when I was 10, my parents came home with a lot of groceries. My mom fussed that the bags were too heavy for us little kids. But my construction-worker dad disagreed. \u201cAnthony, you\u2019re fine. Now get off your ass and go help your mother with the bags.\u201d (He was a\u2026blunt man). Guess what? The bags were heavy, but I could carry them. I was strong enough. I appreciate my mom wanting to shield and protect me. But that type of learned helplessness has profound powerful consequences over time. Some people never get over it. Due to learned helplessness, constant settling, and avoiding risk\u200a\u2014\u200ahabits we learned growing up\u200a\u2014\u200amost people have begun to believe \u201cthis is as good as it gets.\u201d They are content to walk the treadmill of mediocrity\u200a\u2014\u200abreaking a little sweat, but never really getting anywhere. This is not as good as it gets. The first step of any 12 step program for addiction recovery goes something like this: \u201cWe admitted we were powerless over ______, and our lives had become unmanageable.\u201d The first step to unlearning negative mindsets is recognizing you have them, and how much power they\u2019ve had (and still have) over you. Identify what is holding you back\u200a\u2014\u200ain relationships, career, finances, ability, and belief. Then you can move forward. There are three mindsets that cause the most damage in an individual\u2019s life: the Fixed mindset, the Scarcity mindset, and the Entertainment mindset. Carol Dweck\u2019s book Mindset is one of the most powerful books I\u2019ve read in years. She explains the \u201cfixed\u201d mindset is founded on the belief that you can\u2019t change. You are who you are, and that\u2019s final. But that mindset is wrong. You are not fixed. You are a fluid, malleable being, and can become whatever you want. Upgrade your mindset to the \u201cgrowth\u201d mindset: the belief system that says you can change anything about yourself. Failures are simply opportunities to grow, not measurements of your self-worth. You can have whatever you want if you\u2019ll do whatever it takes. The Scarcity mindset says, \u201cThere\u2019s only enough for you! Take what you can, and run!\u201d The Scarcity mindset is living in a perpetual game of Hungry Hungry Hippos. Every day, you must scramble to get yours before it\u2019s gone. It\u2019s exhausting and depressing\u200a\u2014\u200aeven when you \u201cwin.\u201d This isn\u2019t how the world actually works, though. As Adam Grant wrote in his book, Give and Take: \u201cThe world gives to the givers and takes from the takers.\u201d There\u2019s not one pie to fight over; there are unlimited pies. A win for you doesn\u2019t take away from me. My mom once told me if I closed my fist around some cash, I wouldn\u2019t lose it\u200a\u2014\u200abut I couldn\u2019t get any more cash, either. Most people seek entertainment and distraction. But incredible people seek education and learning. Focus on creating and growth, not distraction and mindless entertainment. Author Hal Elrod once wrote, \u201cYour level of success will rarely exceed your level of personal development, because success is something you attract by the person you become.\u201d Entertainment isn\u2019t \u201cbad.\u201d It\u2019s not wrong. But it can be used wrongly, which is what most people do. Most people don\u2019t have the self-control to use entertainment and relaxation in a healthy way. Instead, focus on learning, creating, growing, and evolving. This is how you avoid stagnating in mediocrity and becoming the best version of yourself. The world trains you to operate at substandard levels. Traditional structures like the broken education system, archaic 9\u20135 workday schedule, and endless amounts of addictive entertainment set you up for mediocrity. Don\u2019t fear being different\u200a\u2014\u200afear fitting in with mediocrity. \u201cYou cannot allow the actions of others to define your reality,\u201d prolific writer Steven Pressfield once penned. If you do, you lose control. Most people are consumed with competition and will manipulate you for their cause if you let them. Pressfield went on: Most people just want to fit in and enjoy the safety of the herd\u2014 to fly under the radar, not rock the boat, and live as hassle-free as possible. But eventually, hassle-free morphs into mediocrity. Best-selling author Grant Cardone once said, \u201cIf you are not creating enough new problems for yourself, then you aren\u2019t taking enough action.\u201d Struggle is growth. Experiments, even failed ones, lead to success. Don\u2019t worry about fitting in; you don\u2019t want to be part of that club anyway. Tony Robbins once explained that everyone has a \u201csleeping giant\u201d in them, waiting to be awoken. This giant is a personification of the sacred power of choice we all have\u200a\u2014\u200ato choose to be whatever we want to be. The problem is, most people never wake up their giant. They drift through life on autopilot, unconsciously trudging along without making the difficult but rewarding choices to become extraordinary. The truth is, your estimations of yourself are probably wrong. Perhaps wildly wrong. You are stronger than you think. Most people\u2019s low levels of self-belief came from the agreed-upon norms of a mediocre society, favoring risk-avoidance and comfort over learning and growth. Most people mistakenly believe these self-imposed limits are the ceiling for what they can do. Your estimations are probably wrong. Less than 5 years ago, I was a hopeless porn-addict, I was broke, depressed, overweight, with no leads or prospects. Now, I\u2019m 100% debt-free and my beautiful wife and I are traveling the world. Marriage with her is incredible, and I can\u2019t stop thanking Jesus for her. I don\u2019t look at porn anymore. I lost my beer belly. I\u2019ve gained tens of thousands of followers and I can make a living helping people live a better life. What\u2019s stopping you? Are your estimations about yourself wrong? If you want to live an extraordinary life, you must give up many parts of a normal one. There are three primary securities you must give up if you want to become the best version of yourself: Most people believe they already have \u201ccertainty\u201d of the future. They believe they\u2019ll simply live their life, with their job and health intact, with no problems. But obstacles always arise. \u201cBehind mountains are more mountains,\u201d goes an old Haitian proverb. Difficulties never cease. It\u2019s time to stop believing you have any certainty at all. Your job, family, health, even your life, are not guaranteed for even the next hour. The next security to let go of is the fear of judgement. Becoming the best version of yourself will ruffle some feathers. Once you take a stand on issues you were previously vague with, or declare values you never had the courage to commit to, you\u2019ll attract some critics. The first time I began experiencing this was in my writing. When I finally started to get serious about my work, I began getting some serious, vicious criticisms in the comments. But haters confirm you\u2019re on the right track. It means you\u2019re evolving and growing. You should prioritize learning and creating, not entertainment and distraction. In the words of writer Nicolas Cole: Most people are not the best version of themselves. Due to limiting mindsets they adopted early on, they\u2019ve developed a mistaken belief that their current limitations are actually true. Unlearning limiting mindsets is your responsibility. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll continue living below your potential, never really experiencing true greatness or top-tier achievements. Seek growth, not comfort. Choose learning over entertainment. Make the choice today that you\u2019ll stop living with fake limits and start becoming the best version of yourself you can be.

Spin doctors, spymasters, gossip columnists, historians, courtiers, fixers, ad men, politicians\u200a\u2014\u200ashaping opinion and projecting certain perspectives of reality on to other eyeballs. It is at once both impalpably nebulous, and\u200a\u2014\u200awhen properly applied\u200a\u2014\u200aruthlessly direct. 2017 saw \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d become one of the most commonly searched terms on the entire internet. The underlying rationale for the bulk of that trend can be surmised in three simple words: get rich quick. Any time that such a proposition dominates global consciousness the public relations aspect becomes impossibly fragmented and quite difficult to steer. For an ICO there are two avenues of media worth thinking about, the mainstream and the blockchain specific. It may come as a surprise to people who are new to, or not a part of the crypto community, that there is an entire alternative world of blockchain media. For a company trying to promote its token offering, the crypto media is in fact a far more important space to crack than the traditional media\u200a\u2014\u200aor at least it was in the early life of the ICO industry. This may change. Blockchain media is persuasive to token buyers as it purports to know what it\u2019s talking about. To people inside the crypto tent, in the majority of cases the mainstream media has little understanding of the core concepts of the technology, and is not particularly trusted. There\u2019s a tension here though: as more and more new token buyers come into the blockchain space the power of the traditional media becomes ever more persuasive. The Fake News Problem 2017 saw a huge realignment in the structure of media. This had been going on for years but 2017 finally saw the faultline tear in opposite directions. The seismic focal point of this was the President of the United States. The ground that shifted was a media landscape that had been fractured and hollowed out by the extraction of advertising revenue by Facebook and Google. Into the cavernous void poured \u201calt news\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200asmaller media organizations with niche agendas, opaque funding, and at times intriguing technical leverage. In an unexpected twist the traditional media became the fake news media and to vast swathes of the public, at least in America, the alt media became the trusted media. Defining \u201cfake news media\u201d is a daunting proposition, beyond the scope (or the patience) of this article. But if we take a much more old fashioned view of things, and define fake news as news that has been paid for and is thus advertorial rather than editorial, then much of the blockchain media is fake news media. Much of it isn\u2019t. Discerning between the two is near impossible to the casual observer. The majority of blockchain media is paid content. In the traditional PR game, good PR firms courted and knew journalists. Their success was generated by introducing interesting individuals to interesting media contacts (and often making each appear interesting to the other) and bridging the gap between the two. This sort of intermediary role becomes harder to play when the media that you\u2019re courting unabashedly seeks payment for its service. One would have to be incredibly naive to assume that such paid opportunities aren\u2019t as old as time, but the scratch-my-back world where favours, gifts, and extra spend on advertisements were parlayed into \u201corganic\u201d coverage, has been replaced with a much more overtly fiscal ledger. In this light the blockchain media is a pure product of the post-truth era. The old ideals of journalism\u200a\u2014\u200awhich were perhaps always ideals rather than reality\u200a\u2014\u200aare washing upon the rocks of one of the most lucrative new industries to have broken upon the public imagination, cryptocurrency. Effective PR in the blockchain space needs to embrace paid media while actively pursuing opportunities with traditional media as well. A popular tactic for ICOs to circumvent shortcomings in their budgets is via bounty campaigns, wherein the project leverages an early offering of tokens to reward community building exercises\u200a\u2014\u200aessentially generating paid media engagement with future tokens rather than cash. But these sorts of tactics are heavily reliant on the quality of the project and the ease of telegraphing that message. The Story Problem Finding narratives that make for compelling stories can be challenging. In spite of the assurances of the people whose lives are buried in the project, translation into a truly interesting story for popular consumption is at times complex. Many blockchain projects that are fascinating are difficult to convey to a non-specialist audience with a short attention span. Narrative, story, message\u200a\u2014\u200athis is the essential first step a project needs to review and understand. The second step is highly targeted projection of that message into the laps or inboxes of the sorts of publications that might be interested in it. Then in concert, to pay for or incentivise its widespread distribution across the blockchain space. As 2018 evolves the rules that applied in 2017 will almost surely fall by the wayside, at least in part. Narrative imagination, nimbleness, and deep pockets will likely be the key to success in generating strong PR impact. While the blockchain media may be a new thing, the lessons to be applied are anachronistic. Money is great, story is greater, truth is some function of them both.

That all changed at the 2016 Rio Olympics. I stood near the track as athletes warmed up for a robust day of Olympic competition. As a producer, it\u2019s not unusual to find yourself on the field, backstage, often with a camera crew and living with constant anxiety of accidentally ending up in the shot. But the fear of being impaled by a flying stick was new to me. I was ultimately spared, and, in retrospect, probably unnecessarily worried about death by track and field. But bizarrely enough, such a moment didn\u2019t even feel that strange to me at the time. I was covering the Rio Olympics\u200a\u2014\u200amy third\u200a\u2014\u200athis time as a producer for NBC Sports. Before that, I had covered the 2012 Games in London and the 2014 Sochi Games for The New York Times. All three were a blast\u200a\u2014\u200aa front row seat to the Model United Nations of sports. The Olympics is where a tangled mess of storylines meet and where fates are determined, sometimes by the thousandth of a second (if you\u2019re a luger). But none were what I expected. I\u2019ve been an impassioned Olympics fan since my youth\u200a\u2014\u200agrowing up in 1990s Oregon gave one a vested interest in Tonya Harding and I had the matching ponytail and bangs to prove it\u200a\u2014\u200abut there is still part of the Games that I\u2019ve never understood. The level of focus and drive many of my sources there possess is motivating, humbling, and terrifying. Then, and now, I experience the Games as a total outsider, not understanding how or why people devoted so much to just a few seconds, while I can only manage to wheeze away on a treadmill at my local gym. As it turns out, just hanging out around athletes doesn\u2019t actually make one more fit. In between covering a calendar of sporting events, getting exercise or access to vegetables can be a strain. To put it in bad sports terms\u200a\u2014\u200awhich you will begin to do with everything intentionally or not\u200a\u2014\u200acovering an Olympics is a marathon, not a sprint. And if you don\u2019t take care of yourself, you will pay the price after a few days. By the time I covered Rio, I made a point of walking and trying in earnest to visit a gym as often as I could. It\u2019s impossible to describe the guilt that comes with waking up to cover Mo Farah run one day, only to lay in bed thinking, \u201cHmmm\u2026I don\u2019t really need to go to the gym today\u201d the next. There are other elements of covering an Olympics that feel a bit more familiar; much of it feels like a return to college, which is particularly jarring considering the lone wolf lifestyle of most sports reporters. Members of the press typically stay in their own blocks of hotels, work in arenas or out of a giant warehouse with the charming monniker, \u201cthe Main Press Center/International Broadcast Center,\u201d and schlep around in special buses or trains. Sometimes you dine on delicious local fare (Brazilian steak, London\u2019s menagerie of Indian culinary delights), other times you\u2019re relegated to bland stadium food (the last, sad hot dog on a greasy roller, peanut M&Ms as a protein source). Like college, there are some scheduled activities (women\u2019s soccer kickoff at 8 pm! Figure skating practice at 11 am!) and some free time (the men passed out in the bar at the MPC with Duane Reade lighting in the middle of the day). You get to spend time with old friends and make some new ones, along with navigating a nasal palate that can range from sweat to freshly-plowed snow. There\u2019s even a big celebration with speeches at the end. There are geographic similarities to a college campus, too. In spite of the promises made by host cities about the Games enhancing local life, one of the great sins of Olympic organizers is sterilizing the Olympic Park, bubbling off the Games from the dynamic locales and local flair around them. After a week or so, word gets out of where the best local eats are outside the Olympic Park, which are typically barred from the sealed off area due to security and sponsor concerns. This is a critical subplot beyond the medal count, treasured intelligence among those reporters staying for the long haul, often in town longer than the tourists or athletes that pop in for just a couple of events. Speaking of the guests, I\u2019m here to tell you that there is nothing like the people-watching at the Olympics: the Queen parachuting in with James Bond, LeBron James roaming in and out of non-basketball arenas, the dutiful shuffling of curling sweepers, an inexplicable mime in front of you at the figure skating security line, a giant furry polar bear taking in a hockey game, and on and on. With a press credential around your neck denoting that this is your workplace, you can walk up to just about anyone and just start asking questions, a form of journalistic bliss. Other moments are less blissful. Ahead of Sochi, I made the mistake of thinking, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve spent a summer in Russia and I\u2019ve covered an Olympics, so I\u2019ve got this!\u201d Nyet. Because one half of Sochi\u2019s Olympic park was not even in Sochi, but a 45-minute drive away, access to basics was limited, sparking a sort of black market among journalists. I used some Clif Bars in my bag (a must, by the way, for anyone heading to a Games) to barter for toiletries and other necessities. In a plot that is still mysterious to me, a helpful colleague back in New York somehow procured me a shower curtain, which was handed to me at the figure skating rink by a journalist from another publication. Early in the Games, the lock on my hotel door broke, trapping me in my room. I contemplated a Spiderman-like exit, but realized that I was more than three stories up with little ledging. I couldn\u2019t break my leg\u200a\u2014\u200aI had to go cover figure skating. With the help of an editor who I Gchatted with limited wifi, the Moscow bureau chief busted me out (thanks, David!). Because the lock remained broken for days, I forged some great friendships with my neighbors who promised to keep an eye out if any creeps or stray dogs came into my room. There was no room for existential problems at Sochi; my focus was on eating, sleeping, and working, safely. It was the most expensive sporting event in world history. If I had to be honest, those kinds of adventures are part of why I decided to be a journalist in the first place. I had a fantastic time in Sochi and after the closing ceremony, I flew to northern India to report a story about yoga tourism and digital detoxing. By the time I returned to New York, I was so disoriented that I gave my cab driver the wrong address\u200a\u2014\u200aI had forgotten I moved from the West Village to Brooklyn two days before the Games. Upon arriving to my new home, I had the opposite of mover\u2019s remorse. Rather, I marveled at the hot water in the shower and the electricity. It turns out, if you have anxiety about moving apartments in New York City, it\u2019s best to dump your things, flee the country for a few weeks, live off of pretzels and no sleep, then come back. Covering the Olympics changed me in other ways, helping to shift my focus as a sports reporter and as a human. Specifically, I became interested in the athlete\u2019s reality\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s the centerpiece of my forthcoming book about Kevin Hall, an Olympic sailor who battled a rare form of bipolar disorder against the backdrop of a stunning athletic career. The Olympics also changed my bandwidth, as it makes covering other events feel relatively simple. I remember showing up to the 2012 U.S. Open\u200a\u2014\u200aa spectacle in its own right\u200a\u2014\u200aand my colleagues and I were somewhat shocked there was only one sport to cover. This year, I\u2019ll sit out the Pyeongchang Games in a somewhat bittersweet manner as I prepare for my book launch and tackle some other projects stateside. Given the complete morphing of the American political climate since Rio, I know I\u2019m not alone in being confused about where to file sports in my brain with the onslaught of Washington news. But maybe now, more than ever, we should cling to storylines like the Nigerian bobsledders, South Korean and North Korean hockey players competing on a single team, or the US women\u2019s hockey team continuing crusade for equal pay. The more I think about the Olympics, even from afar, its mere concept stuns me. I can\u2019t think of any other line of work where every four years, people gather to be ranked one, two, and three, then are more or less told to evaporate until the next go-around. So removed is the competitive spirit from the reporters that many of us received participation certificates for just showing up. Between covering an Olympics and competing in one, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind which is more difficult, and that will continue to compel me to watch. And for those heading off to Pyeongchang with their notebooks and cameras in hand, just be thankful that there\u2019s no javelin at the Winter Games.

What is your \u201cbackstory\u201d? I spent a number of years running high growth companies before I started Dosh. Like many entrepreneurs I was focused on creating businesses that were wildly successful and we did that; but, as I grew older, I wanted to also focus doing things that would make a positive difference in people\u2019s lives. I had spent my life chasing money, accomplishments, things, and feeding my ego. I had given money to charities and foundations because it felt good but it wasn\u2019t until I went to Central Africa and the Congo to spend time building water wells\u200a\u2014\u200aseeing the life changing impact something as basic as providing water could do to improve life\u200a\u2014\u200athat my focus shifted to doing good for others. When I realized that doing good and doing business could converge, I had a light bulb moment. I began noticing several things that are around us everyday. I saw some of my extended family members struggling to support their families on the average American salary. I saw people all over the world who could be hugely impacted by an extra $20\u201350 per month. I also noticed that advertisers were spending billions of dollars trying to reach people every day and over half of those dollars were wasted. I asked myself, what if you could move those billions of wasted advertising dollars to consumers by creating a positive connection with brands and businesses they were already shopping with. To do this, I set up an R&D team in Austin, TX that was focused on creating technologies that could put billions of dollars into millions of people\u2019s pockets. We targeted the excess wasted spend in the advertising industry and after a few years, we partnered with the leading credit card companies to create revolutionary technology that would allow people to get cash back automatically on things people were already buying everyday without the need for coupons, rebates, etc. In doing so, we also knew we could help those businesses and brands who who were wasting advertising dollars connect with their customers like they hadn\u2019t done before. In doing so, both merchants and customers would benefit by being connected to Dosh. And billions of dollars could be used to do good. Yitzi: Can you share the funniest or most interesting story that happened to you since you started your company Shortly after we had launched the Dosh app in beta, I received an email from someone who had downloaded the Dosh app. He wrote to tell me that he had taken his friends and family to a restaurant in Florida to celebrate his parent\u2019s anniversary. After dinner, his waiter brought him the check and he gave him his credit card to pay for the meal. Not knowing that the restaurant was integrated into the Dosh app with 10% cash back, he was incredibly surprised when his phone buzzed with the notification that he had received $75 cash back before the waiter had even returned with his card and receipt. He emailed with his enthusiasm about how incredible it felt to get the surprise cash without him having to do anything. It has been moments like that which daily strengthens our resolve to do good. Yitzi: So how exactly does your company help people? Dosh is a cash back app that helps consumers get money back on their purchases while dining, shopping and traveling at over 100,000 retailers like Forever 21, Hallmark, Sam\u2019s Club, Denny\u2019s, Marriott and Starwood Hotels. Dosh helps merchants and retailers deliver seamless performance based customer acquisition and loyalty while creating a positive behavioral connection with their customers. Yitzi: What makes your business stand out? Can you share a story? We are the first company that allows you to automatically get cash back shopping in a store and online, dining at a restaurant and booking a hotel without ever needing to scan a coupon or a rebate. We integrate directly with the credit card companies so that when you swipe your credit card you get instant cash back at over 100,000 brands and businesses. No matter how much money you have, or how little you have, everyone of us would rather keep the money in our pockets but most of us don\u2019t have time for coupons, scanning receipts or looking for a deal. Dosh makes it so you never have to do that again, but you still get the deal. We received a Facebook post from someone a few months ago. Bob, a Dosh member, had gone on a business trip to Minneapolis and stayed at a Marriott. He booked his hotel through the Dosh app and had paid a better price than what the hotel and online travel sites had listed.Three nights had cost him over $1200 but he received $431 in cash back immediately from Dosh. To say that he was happy would be an understatement; those surprise moments of good are what makes us stand out. Yitzi: How have you used your success to bring goodness to the world? Everyday I can look at the Dosh app on my phone and it shows me how much cash back the friends that I referred to the app and those that they\u2019ve referred have recieved. The total goes up all day long and yesterday it surpassed $362,520. It made me feel good that an idea brought to life is doing good things every moment of the day and is thst measuremnt of our success. In each of the conference rooms in our headquarters, we have white ceramic bowls full of Lifesaver candy. Each bowl is meant to represent what we are doing to positively impact millions of people\u2019s lives. The Lifesavers serves as a reminder for what a lifesaver a few dollars of extra cash can be for people. The technology we continue to create and the cash back we continue to drive into people\u2019s wallets is for many, an actual lifesaver\u200a\u2014\u200ait means more money for health insurance payments, a doctor\u2019s appointment, back to school supplies, or a few extra hours not having to work so a single mom can spend more time with her children. We had given the first $100,000 out in cash back, we knew that there were a lot of people out there who were starting to see these small changes in their bank accounts\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014 and all they had to do was download an app. That\u2019s pretty powerful. Yitzi: What are your \u201c5 things I wish someone told me before I Started my Business\u201d and why. (Please share a story or example for each.) 1. Set a strong vision. If you don\u2019t have a big vision, you\u2019ll never grow into a big company. When I started Dosh, I knew it could compete with the Facebooks, and Googles of the world. We set a high bar and bit off a lot, but the idea is what brings people here and what helps them to stay here. 2. Focus your app on the needed key features and execute to the highest standards. Dosh has five complex parts of the business: cash back to consumers via a mobile app, performance based behavioral connection to consumers via a dashboard for merchants, a data platform with machine learning and a mobile wallet. It\u2019s complicated and many people thought it was impossible to do it.. We made the key strategic technology and had our business imperatives clearly defined and then executed with great focus. Everything has been about that focus. 3. Resist the urge to rapidly expand the team in the early days. We have a saying in the office that we only start with \u201c10s.\u201d This means that we hire the smartest and brightest people who are committed to the vision. We don\u2019t compromise on having the best people.. Brett Hurt, founder of several successful billion dollar companies and one of our early investors, encouraged me to reach out to a few technology leaders in Austin as we were to filling out our leadership team. He said, \u201cif you can get one of them you\u2019ll have a great technology leader because they are all 10s.\u201d I said to myself, if they are all great leaders then I want them all. That was my goal and I got each of them. Now I\u2019m watching them and all the engineering leaders that have joined with them impact the technology of the company daily. 4. There are always second chances. I have started or been involved with a number of big businesses. At the end of the day, some will lead to success and some will not. You meet people along the way who want to take advantage of you and people who will go to the end of the world to help you succeed. If you fail, try again. When you try again, try a new approach, try to do more good, look for people who want to do good with you. Look for people you want to see when you go into an office, or people you want to call you when it is 2am and there is a crisis. Those are the people who will help you build a great company. So, if you do fail, try again and keep trying until you succeed. 5. Do good. Every one of us can have a company where we do good. For Dosh, it\u2019s in our DNA. Our members can transfer their cash back from their Dosh wallet to their bank account or Paypal but we have even included a way for members to donate their cash back to any 501c3 charity in the USA. I was having coffee with a journalist recently who has a charity in Houston where she provides clothes to kids in underserved communities. When I showed her that her non-profit was in the app she was floored and I was elated. It\u2019s continued proof that our business can be everyone\u2019s business and help millions of people with billions of dollars. That\u2019s what keeps us going no matter what.

So she constructed the Landlord\u2019s Game, which intended to educate players on the rules and regulations of realty and taxation. Eventually, it ended up being the precursor to the game-which-nobody-ever-finishes, Monopoly. Shortly after producing the game, Maggie told a reporter, \u201cIn a short time, I hope a very short time, men and women will discover that they are poor because Carnegie and Rockefeller, maybe, have more than they know what do to with.\u201d A long time has passed since then and it\u2019s safe to say that Maggie\u2019s hope has not been realized. Monopoly\u2019s creator would look at today\u2019s economic landscape and be disheartened. Inequality remains breathtakingly high, poverty still exists at a startling rate in the wealthiest nation on earth, and her board game has become a celebration of the very economic practices it was designed to denounce. That\u2019s some tragic irony\u200a\u2014\u200athough it appears as if Hasbro is trying to draw attention to Monopoly\u2019s original purpose by releasing a new \u201ccheaters edition\u201d this autumn (as seen above). This is the sort of economic commentary we need right now. For far too long, Americans have acquiesced to an economy ordered by and for monopolies. More than that, control of market share has become the desired outcome in every aspect of economic life\u200a\u2014\u200ait is the logical conclusion of shareholder-driven capitalism. Peter Thiel captured the sentiment of modern times perfectly when he approvingly wrote, \u201cmonopoly is the condition of every successful business.\u201d Naturally, that mindset leads to an economy which lacks robust levels of competition as capital becomes more and more concentrated. Matt Stoller lists the gross outcomes of that worldview: How did we get here though? How did we move from the New Deal economy, which aimed to protect small businesses and empower workers, to a low-wage economy motivated by monopoly capitalism? During the fight against big businesses, Franklin Delano Roosevelt made clear that cutthroat competition needed to be curtailed by strong antitrust laws. He labelled business and financial monopolies as \u201cthe old enemies of peace\u201d\u2014and built up countervailing powers like labor unions and regulations to stop the concentration of power into the few\u2019s hands. FDR was considered a traitor to his class and a champion of the forgotten men and women of America. That\u2019s some favorable messaging territory, and conservatives knew it. It would have been politically ruinous for them to come out in favor of rabid monopolization and abuse of the common worker. So conservative business leaders, politicians, and academics coalesced around the promotion of freedom\u2014namely, the safeguarding of one\u2019s liberty from government intervention. They focused their efforts on making the public fear government monopoly more than a business monopoly. The pro-business political agenda became nothing less than \u201ca noble bid for human freedom.\u201d Hyperbole notwithstanding, they were able to depict the government as the robber baron and big business as the hapless victim of socialist interventionism. In this light, a government that intervened to curb monopolies became worse than the monopolies it aimed to restrain. That logic may sound ridiculous, but this economic narrative worked. In the minds of Americans, Republicans slowly became the lone \u201cguardian of the Ark of the Covenant with its charter of freedom,\u201d as Herbert Hoover declared. By the 1970s, anti-monopoly movements went from being \u201ca bipartisan goal\u201d to an economic framework which \u201cretreated from the public consciousness.\u201d As the worry about corporate consolidation became a partisan issue, \u201cthe enforcement of anti-monopoly policy grew increasingly toothless.\u201d Barry Lynn, the author of Cornered: The New Monopoly Capitalism & The Economics of Destruction, argues that the overturning of anti-monopoly laws came down to the \u201cradical neofeudal wing\u201d of economic thinkers taking over the Republican Party\u2019s economic messaging. It was Reagan who was able to really codify this economic worldview into laws, but in order to do so he needed Democratic help in the House\u2014and he unfortunately got a lot of it. Driven by fears of high inflation, Democrats became fixated on lowering prices for the American consumer. Subsequently, Lynn notes \u201cthe party leaders became increasingly open to the idea that concentration, efficiency, and privatization (under the guise of deregulation) were the best way to serve the nation\u2019s populace.\u201d Unfortunately, all presidents after Reagan continued this line of thinking, which allowed for further corporate consolidation. It is important to recognize that this economic outcome was considered a worst-case scenario just a century ago. Woodrow Wilson, a Democratic centrist who ran to the right of Teddy Roosevelt in 1912, admitted as much, predicting the United States was \u201cnever going to submit to monopoly. America is never going to choose thralldom instead of freedom.\u201d How quaint. The lesson of history is clear: the pull towards monopolization is extremely strong in a capitalist economy. No matter how defiant the people, eventually powerful economic interests prevail. If a government does not make attempts to curb wealth hoarding at both the individual and business level, inequality will rise and competition will be restricted. As we look to reverse the trends of radical inequality, we must analyze the success of the conservative\u2019s messaging. They were annoyingly effective at undoing the New Deal\u2019s policies by changing how Americans thought of the relationship between the government and business. While Lizzie Maggie\u2019s ultimate goal of unveiling the wickedness of monopoly capitalism has yet to be achieved, her instincts were right. She understood how important it is to alter people\u2019s perceptions of the accepted realities around them. Although she\u2019s not here today, she would be quite pleased with Monopoly\u2019s dramatic rule change. What better way to highlight our rigged economy than by making blatant cheating permissible\u2014and advantageous\u2014in a game all about wealth accumulation? Progressives have to finally demonstrate to Americans that monopoly capitalism is not only, as Barry Lynn claims, \u201can ideology of darkness that erects institutions to promote more darkness.\u201d It is a perverse way of ordering an economy. The house rules must change. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out. Contributor to Civic Skunk Works.

Social media gurus, SEO \u2018ninjas\u2019, bloggers, etc. It\u2019s a coterie of tech \u2018club promoters.\u2019 The hype men of the industry. \u2018Hack your way to success.\u2019 \u2018Meet the right people.\u2019 \u2018Become a business superstar.\u2019 They\u2019ve found their silver bullet. They boast of building a passive income from a web business, all while traveling the world as the rest of us mortals are slaving away at our 9\u20135 jobs. In a world where we are searching for silver bullets, these people seem to have amassed an arsenal of them. Moreover they\u2019ve found audiences to sell their silver bullets to en masse. The most blatant example of this are some of the disciples of the 4 Hour Work Week, by Tim Ferriss. The book itself is not really the issue. Ferriss indeed outlines some interesting tips on managing resources to get the highest ROI on your work. What is objectionable, however, is the hack-your-way-to-success mentality it has spawned in entrepreneurial circles. It\u2019s a mindset that is antithetical to everything I know about entrepreneurship. A mindset that I see when I hear people talk about having an amazing idea that they want to farm out to a young college student who can code or outsourcing development of a product to a cheap dev house. It\u2019s a mindset that assumes entrepreneurship is a series of networking events and fundraising meetings, or even some silver-bullet business connection they have in lieu of a real distribution strategy. It\u2019s taking a passive approach to a very difficult undertaking. What is missed in all of this is the mindset of craftsmanship; that one\u2019s expertise and deliberate focus on one\u2019s craft is actually the primary driver for success and not some crapshoot of a series of hacks. What happens on the periphery\u200a\u2014\u200awhether it be the towel slapping we see on Twitter from tech celebrities or headline gossip out of TechCrunch\u200a\u2014\u200ais not actually meaningful as a foundation of a business or a profession. Neither are the number of coffee meetings you have scheduled or the amount of networking meetings you attend. These things are tertiary at best, and at worst, just plain old distractions. To be successful over the course of a career requires the application and accumulation of expertise. This assumes that for any given undertaking you either provide expertise or you are just a bystander. It\u2019s the experts that are the drivers\u2014an expertise that is gained from a curiosity, and a mindset of treating one\u2019s craft very seriously. A startup is by nature a crash course in developing expertise. What makes startups unique is the sheer dearth of resources. This dearth of resources forces founders to rapidly adapt their skills to meet the demands of the project. \u2018I didn\u2019t know how to do x, so I just had to figure it out.\u2019 This is what I regularly hear from successful founders, whereas \u2018I couldn\u2019t find someone to do X, so I had to reconsider whether to pursue it at all\u2019 is a common refrain from unsuccessful founders. If you step up to the challenge, you\u2019ll realize that the startup is nothing more than a teacher. It in fact is a great teacher for no other reason than it demands the accumulation of knowledge quickly for the startup to survive. A technical founder, whose experience may relegate her or him to a specialist role in a large company, for example, has to adapt and take on more expertise in adjacent technical areas. There simply aren\u2019t the human resources to hand off these tasks to another specialist. This is true for taking on tasks in other domains, whether that be sales, finance, marketing, management or design. You have to take an interest in these domains because there is no one else to fill these roles in your early stage company. It\u2019s in exploring these unknown territories and facing the headwind of startup challenges that it becomes clear that the startup is merely a force of catalytic professional and character growth. With actual success of any given venture subject to the whim of outside forces, this growth is the non-monetary dividend that makes the experience priceless. That is why the passive, 4-Hour Mindset is so self defeating. To lounge on a beach or travel the world and not actively engage in building your arsenal of expertise is professional malpractice. It\u2019s also not practical. No serious company has been created passively\u2014the passive mindset that leads people to say \u201cI\u2019ve got a great idea. I\u2019ll hire a team to build it out\u201d or \u201cI have this great connection who will drive sales,\u201d while I play armchair visionary. Startup graveyards are full of visionaries without expertise or the proper skills to execute, for no other reason than ideas are not self executing, but are rather made into being by intense engagement by skilled operators. Most importantly, to think of a business as a series of hacks and transactional relationships, you\u2019ll never amass the expertise that your future self and future businesses need to succeed. Startups fail withstanding founder expertise, of course. It is certainly not sufficient to be an expert. However, expertise does make it possible to traverse the struggles of creating businesses over the course of a career. You\u2019re not simply working on the idea in front of you, you\u2019re building the knowledge to succeed at your next projects as well. It is the expertise and the mindset of craftsmanship that allows someone like Elon Musk to jump from project to project and sector to sector with the knowledge of how to execute on the highest level problems. It\u2019s not simply his ability to find interesting ideas. It\u2019s his command of the domains of the business that allow him to execute the way he does. He is the epitome of interdisciplinary student of his businesses. If you are to optimize for anything, optimize for the long term. Use the challenges of your business today to build mastery in your craft. There is no guarantee that any one venture will succeed, but that mastery will bend luck in your favor over the long course of your career.

It\u2019s a weekday morning in March, and he\u2019s working out of his clean, quiet two-bedroom house in Beverly Hills. The office, next to the kitchen, feels like some kind of resonating chamber for his mania, a tiny room with a window that looks out onto a twisty canyon road. A poster of I.F. Stone, the independent journalist and muckraker, hangs on the wall, along with a small, framed piece of paper that Leopold recently found sitting on a table at the U.S. military base in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. It\u2019s one of his favorite document scores ever: a \u201cPublic Affairs Smart Card\u201d created for the military\u2019s PR folks, telling them to \u201cOwn the Interview\u201d and \u201cStay in your Lane\u201d and listing the many topics they\u2019re not allowed to discuss, including \u201cInvestigations or their Results,\u201d \u201cSuicide,\u201d \u201cConstruction,\u201d \u201cPresidential Remarks,\u201d and \u201cAttorney Allegations.\u201d (To Leopold, this one scrap of paper made the whole trip worthwhile because it revealed how the government tries to control information. \u201cI\u2019m like, you idiots, why did you leave that lying around?\u201d) And everywhere, stacked on bookshelves and on his desk, are piles of paper from every imaginable government agency, state and federal, topped by response letters: Dear Mr. Leopold\u2026 Dear Mr. Leopold\u2026 I first learned about Leopold\u2019s work from Twitter. His profile picture showed him standing in front of the entrance to Guant\u00e1namo wearing a T-shirt from the punk band Black Flag. He called himself a \u201cFOIA terrorist\u201d\u2014FOIA, the Freedom of Information Act. I started following him. The range of stuff that zips by on his feed is staggering and kind of thrilling: 140-character dispatches about guards and prisoners, spies and secrets, corporate intrigue, torture and war. Many of his tweets link to government documents he\u2019s dug up. The documents regularly supply ammo to left and libertarian causes (curtailing NSA surveillance, closing Guant\u00e1namo), but Leopold doesn\u2019t present as an activist. He comes off more like a stonecutter chipping away at the base of a mountain, sometimes getting pebbles, sometimes boulders. Today there\u2019s a small stack of recent FOIA responses next to his iMac. When I ask about them, Leopold starts flipping through the pile, page by page, with a mixture of irritation and amusement. He says he asked for all documents from the Department of Homeland Security about how it monitors the Tea Party movement. \u201cThis is really frankly fucking annoying as hell,\u201d he says, looking at the letter from the government. The agency took a year to respond to his request, and now it has given him exactly three pages of documents, \u201credacted to the point where I don\u2019t really know what it\u2019s about,\u201d he says. So he appealed the decision. (He appeals every response as a matter of principle: \u201cI don\u2019t care if they\u2019re like, \u2018Here\u2019s a bunch of documents.\u2019 Still appeal. There may be something left. Have them perform another search. Because they\u2019re just terrible at it.\u201d) He asked for all white papers, PowerPoints, and policy summaries on the use of drones in U.S. airspace and internationally for the purposes of engaging in lethal force against terrorist targets. He asked for \u201call draft talking points prepared by the NSA following the leaks of classified material about NSA surveillance programs\u201d; he already got the final versions of the talking points, but he wants the drafts, too, for insight into the government\u2019s thought process. \u201cThis is great,\u201d he says, grinning at the NSA letter. \u201cThey identified 156 pages of draft talking points but they classified every single page as top secret.\u201d Leopold shoots me a deadpan look: \u201cThe draft talking points.\u201d He asked for all CIA files on the folk singer and activist Pete Seeger. The agency sent him a \u201cGlomar response,\u201d a kind of evasive maneuver in which an agency neither confirms nor denies that the information exists, and says that if it does exist, it\u2019s classified. \u201cEveryone wants to get a Glomar every now and then,\u201d Leopold tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of like: You hit something. You achieved a Glomar: one point!\u201d (Though his request was rejected by the CIA, Leopold obtained Seeger documents from the FBI that show one agent investigating a complaint from a government employee about his \u201cfeelings of revulsion\u201d after listening to a \u201chighly inflammatory\u201d Seeger tape.) Leopold picks up a piece of paper, squints, frowns. It\u2019s a letter from the Postal Inspection Service. He asked them for\u2026 something. \u201cTo be honest with you, I don\u2019t remember,\u201d he says. \u201cThis was not even that long ago. Um.\u201d We\u2019re not even through half the pile. The Freedom of Information Act, passed in 1966 to increase trust in government by encouraging transparency, has always been a pain in the ass. You write to an uncaring bureaucracy, you wait for months or years only to be denied or redacted into oblivion, and even if you do get lucky and extract some useful information, the world has already moved on to other topics. But for more and more people in the past few years, FOIA is becoming worth the trouble. There\u2019s a whole segment of the tech community, for example, that wants to improve how cities and governments function by sharing data openly, and sometimes FOIA is the only way to get the right data. Activists are using it to investigate the views and ties of university professors. And journalists are turning to FOIA as the profession changes in ways that make the law more necessary. For one thing, it\u2019s getting harder for national security reporters to obtain government secrets the old-fashioned way, by coaxing them from sources. Even before Edward Snowden, the Obama administration was pursuing leakers of classified information with unprecedented aggression, going so far as to seize journalists\u2019 phone records. Now, fearing another Snowden, the government has intensified its crackdown. \u201cPeople are just not willing to give shit up,\u201d Leopold says. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019ll go to jail.\u2019\u201d With FOIA, though, you don\u2019t have to imperil a source: Instead of asking a vulnerable human to spill government secrets, you ask the government for those secrets directly. There\u2019s also simple opportunism behind the FOIA boomlet in journalism: Primary source documents play well on the Web. They add heft to posts, building trust in young sites. The data work of Nate Silver, the Snowden-sped muckraking of Glenn Greenwald and colleagues, the expos\u00e9s of Gawker and even TMZ\u2014all of this ravenous digital journalism is trying to tap some external source of truth, to develop some pipeline of facts that can better withstand reader skepticism, and FOIA happens to be a set of pipes that\u2019s already there. Leopold has shown that it\u2019s possible to build an entire working method around FOIA. Over and over, by demanding information more creatively and more persistently than anyone else, he gets documents no one else gets, like the military\u2019s horrifyingly clinical description of how guards at Guant\u00e1namo are force-feeding prisoners on hunger strikes, and manuals describing how the Department of Homeland Security is monitoring Twitter for terrorist threats, and FBI records about the late investigative journalist Michael Hastings. (Leopold got the Hastings records by suing the bureau along with Ryan Shapiro, a friend and fellow FOIA obsessive; the documents showed that the bureau opened a file on Hastings to \u201cmemorialize controversial reporting\u201d by him, including a story in Rolling Stone about the American prisoner of war Bowe Bergdahl, captured in 2009 by the Taliban and released in May.) Leopold\u2019s FOIA requests also play a role in larger battles for some of the most highly contested documents in the land. In late May, the government decided to release a legal memo about the 2011 \u201ctargeted killing\u201d of the U.S. citizen and jihadist cleric Anwar Al-Awlaki, who was killed by a drone in Yemen. A lot of people have demanded to see this memo; the ACLU and The New York Times sued to force its release. The government argued that releasing it would harm national security. But a panel of appeals-court judges ruled that this argument didn\u2019t make sense. Why? One big reason: Leopold already had the memo, in essence. He\u2019d put in a FOIA request for a sixteen-page white paper that contained a lot of the same legal reasoning. It argued that the U.S. could kill a \u201csenior operational leader\u201d or \u201can associated force\u201d of Al Qaeda without the need for \u201cclear evidence that a specific attack on U.S. persons and interests will take place in the immediate future.\u201d Leopold\u2019s FOIA successes have allowed him to make a living as a freelancer, writing news stories for Al-Jazeera America, Vice News, and other publications. He also publishes stories at Beacon Reader, a crowdfunding website that lets freelancers sell subscriptions to their work; there he offers \u201cLessons in FOIA Terrorism,\u201d plus a \u201cFOIA Terrorist\u201d T-shirt, for ninety dollars a year. One reason Leopold has been able to build a following is that he\u2019s a master of the law at a time when a lot of people want to learn it. Unlike many of his disciples, though, he has embraced FOIA for deeply idiosyncratic reasons. He isn\u2019t just using it to dig up documents. He\u2019s using it, in part, to atone for past sins. He\u2019s using it to transform himself. He\u2019s pretty open about what happened. Writing about Leopold means reckoning with a uniquely full-disclosure human. Early in our conversations, I asked him what a national security reporter was doing in Beverly Hills. Most of those writers live on the East Coast, to be close to government sources. He said he used to live in New York, but he had to get out. Then he told me the story in what seemed like one unbroken breath. It started with cocaine, which he discovered as a twenty-year-old, working in the music business. As he fell into addiction, a number of bad things happened in quick succession. He failed out of New York University. He tried to kill himself. He spent a month in a mental hospital. He started stealing promotional CDs at the music label he worked for and sold them at record stores to buy coke. He got caught and arrested, and eventually had to plead guilty to a felony theft charge to avoid jail time. He thought maybe he could get off drugs by moving to a new city, so he left New York for Los Angeles, where he\u2019d met someone on a previous trip\u2014Lisa Brown, a calm, steady woman who worked as a music executive at a children\u2019s TV network. He wanted to marry her. But he didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d make a living. He took stock of his skills. In New York, for a brief time, he\u2019d written obituaries for a small newspaper. \u201cThe only thing I knew how to do was write,\u201d he says. So in L.A., he joined the Whittier Daily News as a cops and courts reporter. His plan to get sober in L.A. didn\u2019t work. Within six months, he was using again. He moved from the paper to a small wire service, which fired him after an attorney threatened to sue for libel over a quote in one of his stories. The quote was legitimate, but the wire service couldn\u2019t afford a lawsuit, and Leopold\u2019s editor didn\u2019t back him. Not long afterward, in 1997, Lisa, now his wife, confronted Leopold about his drug use. He spent a month in rehab and began to attend 12-step meetings. But he wasn\u2019t in therapy, wasn\u2019t at peace. He spent the next several years chasing stories, winning scoops, and trailing debris through various California newsrooms, never telling anyone about his criminal past. Editors always loved Leopold at the start. He had real talent, an instinct for novelty coupled to an electric aggression, and his stories won lots of internal praise and even some awards. But he tended to bungle quotes and make spelling mistakes, and he was willing to bend or break ethical norms to get stories, sometimes lying to sources to get interviews and breaking agreements he made about what information should be on and off the record. \u201cMy whole thing was, I wanted to get at the truth by any means necessary,\u201d he says. He got fired from the Los Angeles Times after another reporter complained that he was playing music too loud and Leopold threatened to \u201crip your fucking head off your shoulders, you little prick.\u201d Instead of stepping back, he pushed harder. In 2002, after reporting for a time at Dow Jones Newswires and covering the Enron beat, Leopold published a long investigative piece in Salon about the role of a key Enron figure named Thomas White. Leopold botched it. For one thing, he relied on a particularly damning email from White that he couldn\u2019t prove was authentic. (He says he shared the email with his Salon editors, and they agreed he should use it.) Worse, he plagiarized seven paragraphs of the piece from an earlier Enron story in the Financial Times. Leopold says the plagiarism was a mistake made in haste; he credited the FT in the story, though no amount of credit could have justified that much lifted material. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can say that will explain it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was completely fucked up.\u201d Salon apologized to its readers, and the media reporter David Carr pointed out Leopold\u2019s mistakes in The New York Times: \u201cWeb Article Is Removed; Flaws Cited.\u201d Leopold revealed all of this in News Junkie, a memoir he published in 2006, with a cover featuring a keyboard, a coffee ring, and a line of coke. News Junkie is a dark book that rides on long passages of dialogue (Leopold says he kept journals) and potboiled prose. Typical sentence: \u201cHellbent on living the life of a rock star, I drank a half bottle of straight whiskey and snorted eightballs of cocaine nearly every day.\u201d It feels like the outpouring of a guy who realizes he\u2019s been destroyed by the secrets he\u2019s kept and vows to never keep one again. Leopold failed to disclose, so here\u2019s an orgy of disclosure to compensate. He writes that his father, a blue-collar New Yorker with a panther tattoo on his arm, used to beat him. He writes about wanting to smash a particular lawyer\u2019s head with a baseball bat, and deciding to send David Carr a gift-wrapped box of elephant shit, \u201ctwo big logs,\u201d before losing his nerve. After Carr\u2019s article, Leopold panicked that he would never be able to work in journalism again: \u201cIt felt like my arms had been amputated.\u201d Still, his wife stuck with him. \u201cThe thing that I was really drawn to was his honesty,\u201d Lisa says, \u201cwhich seems so ironic, but he was so real, and honest. He\u2019s very honest with his emotions\u2026. Through the drug-use phase, I still ultimately felt he was honest about how he felt about me. Like, that has never\u2014I have never doubted that.\u201d But if anyone else was going to see what Lisa saw in him, he needed to start over. One afternoon in L.A., Leopold lets me tag along to a meeting with a source so I can see how he operates now. Leopold\u2019s been talking to the guy for a year, but has never met him in person. The guy says he has some information about misconduct and incompetence in the part of the government that performs background checks on potential employees\u2014the same part that failed to flag Edward Snowden as a security risk. Leopold says he\u2019s asked the source if I can observe their meeting, and the source has agreed. We walk out Leopold\u2019s front door and hop into his black Mercedes C250. There\u2019s a child seat in the back, and on top of the seat, a stack of rock and punk CDs. (Leopold owns a massive collection of rock-concert T-shirts that takes up almost three full closets in his bedroom and spills into the room proper. \u201cI gave it all up\u2014the drugs, the alcohol,\u201d he says. \u201cI gotta have something.\u201d) I ask how he can afford a Benz. \u201cIt\u2019s actually not that expensive,\u201d he says. \u201cSame price as a Prius. My wife drives a Prius.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI\u2019m still fakin\u2019 it, I guess.\u201d We drive toward Redondo Beach, listening to The Fall and talking about his fascination with Guant\u00e1namo Bay. It\u2019s such a strange, dark world, he says, and there aren\u2019t a lot of people reporting on it. Maybe the biggest story of Leopold\u2019s career came from Guant\u00e1namo. Last year, he received an encrypted email from a source. It contained the government\u2019s translation of six handwritten notebooks belonging to a Saudi prisoner named Abu Zubaydah. George W. Bush called Zubaydah \u201cone of the top operatives plotting and planning death and destruction on the United States,\u201d and the CIA used him as a guinea pig for its torture program, flying him overseas and waterboarding him repeatedly. But in a four-part series for Al-Jazeera America, Leopold pointed out that while Zubaydah was clearly a man of \u201chard-core anti-Western sentiments and a willingness to embrace violence and death for the cause,\u201d he wasn\u2019t the high-level leader the U.S. government had said he was. A functionary, not a mastermind. Leopold used the diaries to humanize Zubaydah. He quoted the jihadist on his fondness for elements of Western culture: \u201cThe Lady in Red\u201d songwriter Chris de Burgh; Rambo III (\u201cI watched this movie and I laughed loudly\u2026 My eyes became teary because of the deep laugh\u201d); Pepsi (\u201cFive chilled bottles of Pepsi Cola\u2026 is a very amazing thing\u2014especially when you drink the bottle as one shot\u201d). \u201cIt almost makes me think about myself,\u201d Leopold says. \u201cWhat made me make the choices that I made in my own life? And is there such a thing as redemption?\u2026. What does it mean, what does it look like?\u201d Leopold is a jittery driver, checking his phone at every light. He\u2019s afraid he\u2019ll miss something: an email from his lawyer about documents on the way, a note from an editor or a source, a tweet on a breaking story. We eventually come to a coffee shop in a strip mall and get a table outside. A few minutes later, the source shows up and shakes Leopold\u2019s hand. He sees my tape recorder and asks if it\u2019s on; I tell him no. On the other side of the coffee shop\u2019s window, a guy in a Jimi Hendrix shirt is typing on a laptop. \u201cIs he with you?\u201d the source says. He starts talking at high speed about the nuances of government procedures, jabbing his finger at Leopold\u2019s reporter\u2019s notebook, giving him names and dates but no quotes for the record. Leopold asks a series of simple, basic questions, trying to get the guy to slow down and walk him through the material; the guy asks in a worried tone if Leopold got the documents he sent, irritated that Leopold doesn\u2019t seem to recall every detail. There\u2019s a lot at stake here: If either guy misjudges the other, they could both end up screwed. Leopold keeps telling the source that he\u2019s okay, that no one is listening to their conversation, but when a random dude in an NPR T-shirt begins to loiter outside the coffee shop behind him, the source clams up until the dude walks away: \u201cHe\u2019s wearing an NPR T-shirt.\u201d Leopold is confused by this statement. After an hour of tense back-and-forth, Leopold shakes the source\u2019s hand and says goodbye, and we climb back into the Benz. Whistleblowers are \u201ca very very unique breed,\u201d he says. He understands and shares their passion for exposing injustice, but at the same time, you \u201chave to really vet them.\u201d The meeting has left Leopold a bit wary. The source\u2019s paranoia, he says, may be a notch against his credibility. It\u2019s hard to know what might be real and what might be generated by the guy\u2019s own fear. Leopold got burned by a source once. It happened in May 2006, just as News Junkie was rolling off the presses. Here\u2019s how he tells the story. His phone rang on a Saturday afternoon when he was in the car with Lisa. The call was from an FBI source he trusted implicitly, a guy who had come through for him on multiple stories. Now the source gave Leopold huge news: Karl Rove, the conservative political strategist and deputy White House chief of staff, had been indicted in the Valerie Plame leak investigation. Plame, an undercover CIA agent, was married to a high-profile former ambassador who had written a New York Times op-ed that angered the Bush administration. Someone with knowledge of her secret identity had leaked it to journalists, apparently as retribution. Leopold felt like this was \u201cthe most unbelievable injustice,\u201d and he had been pursuing the story for the liberal news site Truthout. If Rove had truly been indicted, it could reroute American politics. \u201cI was like, \u2018Holy fucking shit!\u2019\u201d Leopold recalls. \u201cI pulled over. I was like, \u2018Lisa, I gotta go, here, bye.\u2019\u201d Leopold called another source that he and the FBI guy both knew, and the second source confirmed that Rove had been indicted. Next, Leopold called the spokesman for special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald and left a message. He didn\u2019t immediately hear back. Then he called his editor, Marc Ash, who interviewed one of Leopold\u2019s sources on the phone \u201cat significant length,\u201d Ash recalls. \u201cI walked away with the impression that I was talking to someone who was in fact qualified, and was providing solid information.\u201d Leopold and Ash decided to publish the story without any caveats, without saying it was a rumor. Leopold wrote in Truthout that \u201cRove\u2019s indictment was imminent.\u201d He was trying to beat the Times and the Washington Post. He did beat them\u2014with a false story. Rove hadn\u2019t been indicted and never would be. In his 2010 memoir, Rove called Leopold \u201ca nut with Internet access.\u201d The timing, for Leopold, couldn\u2019t have been worse: He had just published a memoir portraying himself as addict, liar, and thief, and now he had blown one of the biggest stories in the country. Other journalists chewed over Leopold\u2019s mistake on blogs, in newspaper columns, and on radio. The Columbia Journalism Review, in an article that still comes up on the first page of Google results for \u201cJason Leopold,\u201d called Leopold a \u201cserial fabulist\u201d and compared him to Stephen Glass, one of the most prolific liars in modern journalism history. Leopold\u2019s attorney sent CJR a letter saying the statements were false and defamatory: There was a difference between getting a story wrong and making a story up. \u201cI mean, I was a crazy guy,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019m not that crazy.\u201d Leopold is apologetic and horrified when he talks about the Rove story. \u201cIt\u2019s like, what the fuck was I thinking?\u201d he says. Were his sources lying to him? \u201cI really just don\u2019t know.\u201d (Scooter Libby, a close advisor to Vice President Dick Cheney, had discussed Plame with reporters, and was later convicted of four felony counts for lying about it. Rove\u2019s attorney later admitted that Rove had disclosed Plame\u2019s covert identity to a Time reporter but didn\u2019t identify her by name.) The investigative reporter and blogger Marcy Wheeler, who covered the Plame leak and is now known for her work on civil liberties and national security, offers a plausible explanation: \u201cI basically think Leopold got used by FBI sources. He published that Rove was being indicted as a means to pressure Fitzgerald into indicting him, and it didn\u2019t happen, and he didn\u2019t burn his sources, and as a result, he took egg in the face.\u201d Leopold is still trying to figure out what went wrong; earlier this year, he filed FOIAs with the George W. Bush Presidential Library for records on Rove and Plame to see if he could find any clues. What do you do as a journalist when you run short? The next couple of years were hard for Leopold, and they would have been harder if not for the birth of his son, Hill, in 2008. \u201cI just didn\u2019t care about anything else,\u201d he says. Despite the perception in some parts of the profession that he was done for, Leopold continued to report. He wanted to make up for the Rove story, and he couldn\u2019t do that without producing new work. He remained on staff at Truthout. He interviewed Valerie Plame on video. (Plame has long supported Leopold; she recently messaged him and one of his Al-Jazeera America colleagues on Twitter and said she was \u201cproud to know you both & call you friends.\u201d) He wrote about veterans and post-traumatic stress disorder for an obscure site. He started his own site and posted the odd document there. Eventually he caught a break. In 2010, a military source gave him a set of documents he\u2019d obtained through FOIA showing how the Air Force trained young officers in the ethics of launching nuclear weapons. The jewel in the pile was a forty-three-slide PowerPoint presentation in which the Air Force quoted from the Bible (\u201cJesus Christ is the mighty warrior\u201d), St. Augustine, and Wernher von Braun, the ex-Nazi who helped America launch its space program. (\u201cWe wanted to see the world spared another conflict such as Germany had just been through,\u201d the von Braun quote read, \u201cand we felt that only by surrendering such a weapon to people who are guided by the Bible could such an assurance to the world be best secured.\u201d) Leopold wrote a story for Truthout\u2014\u201cJesus Loves Nukes,\u201d the headline began\u2014and linked to the raw documents in the text. The story spread quickly, shared by readers and by other reporters, maybe because no one sharing it had to worry about whether they could trust the person who had unearthed the documents; they only had to trust the documents themselves. For Leopold, it was a lightbulb moment; he wanted to do more work with that kind of impact and reach. He asked the military source to help him better understand FOIA, and the source obliged. He explained how to write an effective request. You had to send the request to exactly the right place, and you had to tell the FOIA analyst on the other end which keywords to use and even which databases to search. The trick was to let them know you knew as much about FOIA as they did, if not more. The great thing about FOIA, for Leopold, was that it didn\u2019t care about his past. It was just a law, an impersonal series of rules and procedures, inputs and outputs. Anyone could make a request: a good person, a bad person, a person who had done something bad and was trying to be good. There was hope in that. Slowly, letter by letter, Leopold discovered the power of FOIA. The main thing was a simple mental shift, an epiphany that filled him with a glee that never really went away. According to the law, Leopold could ask the U.S. government for anything, as long as it was an agency record. They didn\u2019t have to give it to him, but he could ask: for emails and schedules and meeting minutes, for reports and standard operating procedures, for PowerPoints and white papers, even for lists of other people\u2019s FOIAs\u2014and not just for these things but also for the things that the government was saying to itself as it decided whether to give him these things. He could ask for the \u201cprocessing notes\u201d of his own FOIAs. (In one set of processing notes from the Department of Justice, an agency employee jokes that Leopold is part of a \u201cFOIA posse\u201d; a DOJ colleague shoots back that he should start a band.) He could ask for stuff so outlandishly secret and high-level that even he had a hard time believing the government would cough it up, stuff like the emails of Keith Alexander, former director of the NSA\u2014but he got them. This dude who was reading all these other people\u2019s emails? Leopold could get his emails. \u201cJust give them to me! They\u2019re government records, give them to me!\u201d (Leopold recently published emails between Alexander and high-level executives at Google, and the NSA folks have told him that more emails from Alexander are on the way. \u201cThe intelligence folks are really nice,\u201d Leopold says. \u201cEven though they\u2019re doing all these allegedly terrible things, they\u2019re really nice.\u201d) As he investigated the machinery of FOIA, he found the hidden gears and tricks that made the machine work faster. Like expedited processing: If he could demonstrate a \u201ccompelling need\u201d for information that must be released urgently, it could move his request to the top of the pile. And at every step, Leopold learned, if the answer was no, he could appeal. Appeal the denial of expedited processing. Appeal the integrity of the search. Appeal the redactions. Sue. Yes, he could sue the government to get the documents he wanted. \u201cGoing to court completely changes the process,\u201d Leopold says. \u201cIt forces them into action.\u201d With an activist attorney in D.C. named Jeffrey Light, Leopold has sued the government eleven times in the past two years. For perspective, his ten open FOIA lawsuits is nine more than the entire staff of The Wall Street Journal has right now, and it\u2019s about the same number of suits that the The New York Times has opened or concluded in the past year. \u201cIt becomes almost like an addiction, you know?\u201d Leopold says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a secret. I have a totally addictive personality. And I think it\u2019s healthy, because I\u2019m taking advantage of the democratic process\u2026. I\u2019m doing everything by the book.\u201d He makes the process transparent, too. He shares not just the documents but the journey toward them. When the government denies him, or heavily redacts, he publishes the government\u2019s explanation, which is often revealing in itself. There\u2019s almost no way for him to lose. Within the FOIA world, anyway. The journalism world is another story. Leopold is not forgiven. He is followed, he is read, he is respected, and he even has his fans: According to former L.A. Times reporter Terry McDermott, who has written two books about 9/11 and its aftermath, \u201cIf [Leopold] were working for the New York Times, every journalist in the country would know who he was.\u201d But because of Leopold\u2019s mistakes on the Rove story, and maybe also the Enron story, he\u2019s still a little bit toxic. I had a hard time getting prominent national security reporters to weigh in on Leopold, even ones who had written about his recent work in a positive light. They\u2019re \u201csort of caught,\u201d says Allen McDuffee, who covers national security for Wired and used to work with Leopold at Truthout. \u201cThey definitely have to recognize the work that he\u2019s done, but they don\u2019t want to give him credit as a journalist for doing it.\u201d Stories that praise Leopold\u2019s FOIA scoops often refer to him not as a journalist but as an \u201cactivist.\u201d Last month, he got into a Twitter exchange with Spencer Ackerman, the national security editor for the Guardian US and a widely respected reporter. Ackerman tweeted, \u201cThere is video evidence of Guant\u00e1namo Bay force-feedings\u2026. So today, I filed a FOIA for it. We\u2019ll see what they do.\u201d Leopold replied, \u201cBeat u to it. I filed FOIA for it last July & it\u2019s now part of my wide-ranging Gitmo FOIA lawsuit.\u201d Leopold linked to a PDF of his legal complaint. Ackerman tweeted back, \u201cuh, good for you?\u201d Leopold\u2019s whole approach was right there in microcosm, and his problem, too: his pride in being first, his eager self-promotion, his ache for validation from his peers, his peers\u2019 uncertainty about who the fuck this guy is. (In an email to me, Ackerman writes that he and Leopold have \u201cnever met, never had any sort of relationship, and so I found it an odd & random thing to tweet at me.\u201d) Leopold\u2019s crimes against journalism were serious. But it\u2019s hard to think of any journalist who has worked harder to show that he\u2019s changed. Some miscreants don\u2019t visibly change at all and are forgiven anyway. Leopold is different. He\u2019s been sober 17 years, he says. He has made his work part of his rehabilitation; he has slowly rebuilt journalistic trust by circumventing the usual idea of it. \u201cHe\u2019s always trying to prove that what people have been saying about him is wrong,\u201d Lisa Leopold says. How many years of good work does he have to produce before he will be forgiven? He already has eight years. So is it ten years? Twenty? Last month, he conducted the first interview in seven years with James Mitchell, the Florida psychologist who helped the CIA design its torture regime and who had never before spoken publicly about his role. Leopold published it in the Guardian, his first byline there. He followed it up on May 22 with his second Guardian piece, based on a classified Pentagon report he won through a FOIA lawsuit; the report described \u201cstaggering\u201d and \u201cgrave\u201d damage to U.S. intelligence capabilities as a result of the Snowden disclosures, but provided no details of specific damage. Does the fact that he\u2019s writing for the Guardian mean he\u2019s back in the club? No one will tell him; forgiveness doesn\u2019t work like that. Which is why he fantasizes sometimes about The Document. One day at lunch\u2014a Greek place in Beverly Hills\u2014he tells me he dreams of discovering the ultimate document, some kind of tape or report \u201cwhere I look at it and it\u2019s like, \u2018This is it. This is what I\u2019m waiting for for ten years.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s a videotape of terror suspects being waterboarded by the CIA\u2014a squirreled-away copy of one of the tapes they famously destroyed. Maybe it\u2019s something else. The Document. A record of such clear and deep injustice that it will upend trust in the powerful at the same time it restores trust in him. A thing he can show not just to the public but to the journalism community, to his peers, and say, \u201cOkay, are we good now?\u201d It\u2019s out there. He may have a filed a request for it a month ago, or a year. And when it suddenly appears, in his mailbox or in his Dropbox, he will know he has to move quickly, carefully but quickly, to push the news into the world before he gets scooped.

The problem is that this default setup, with built-in apps, non-stop notifications, and constant cries for your attention has nothing to do with productivity or happiness. I\u2019ve seen this firsthand. Several years ago, I had a job where I reviewed mobile phone apps and gadgets. In the course of this job, I realized how much our phones were taking over our lives each day. The entire industry is built around begging for your attention. But you\u2019re the boss of your phone, and you should be the one in charge of when and how you give your attention. There\u2019s a better way. Let\u2019s take a look at the ways you can set up your Android phone for a more zen experience. This guide will give you step-by-step instructions that will work for the majority of Android phones. The menus may look slightly different on your particular device, but the thought process will be the same. A supposed selling point for Android is how customizable the lock screen is. Some people like to add widgets, notifications, and all sorts of information to the lock screen. But these extra bells and whistles just tend to distract you; they take you away from the task that prompted you to pick up your phone in the first place. Remember what the purpose of a lock screen is. It\u2019s really just there as a security measure. You shouldn\u2019t be reading notifications there\u200a\u2014\u200ayou should be confirming your identity and then moving on to more important tasks. If you want the security of a lock screen that doesn\u2019t display your notifications, here\u2019s an easy way to do it. 2. Tap \u201cSecurity & location\u201d 3. Tap \u201cLock screen preferences\u201d 4. Tap \u201cOn the lock screen\u201d and choose \u201cDon\u2019t show notifications at all\u201d Once you have this set up you\u2019ll still have the security of a lock screen, without being bombarded by a stream of notifications as soon as you look at your phone. Most Android phones come with a home screen pre-configured. Often there are shortcuts to the apps the manufacturer assumes you\u2019ll use the most. Worse, there are often some sponsored apps that companies have paid to get in front of you. You\u2019re paying to be advertised to. That\u2019s not cool. In almost all cases, there are a lot of things that you just don\u2019t need to be staring at. The home screen certainly is a personal space that will vary from user to user. But here I will give you my rationale for why a clean, uncluttered home screen works the best. My home screen has no app shortcuts. It does not has excessive widgets. It has nothing but a Google search icon, the date and weather, and navigation buttons. Whenever I look at my home screen, I see nothing but the relaxing live wallpaper that I\u2019ve installed. All of my apps are still easily accessible with a swipe up from the bottom, but there are no shortcuts with badges of unread messages or widgets displaying news headlines that I didn\u2019t ask for. A clear home screen equates to a clear mind, and it makes me far more productive. App badges, in particular, are a case of the app manufacturing trying to control your behavior. If there\u2019s one principle of this article, it\u2019s that you should always be in control of your phone. I\u2019m glad not to see those badges any more. Here\u2019s how to remove the clutter from your home screen: 2. You\u2019ll see some options appear at the top of the page (Remove, App info, Uninstall) 3. Drag the icon into the option that says \u201cRemove\u201d 4. Repeat the process for any widget or app shortcut that you no longer want to see on the home screen Don\u2019t worry, removing an app shortcut from your home screen doesn\u2019t entirely remove the app from your phone\u200a\u2014\u200ait just takes away that visual distraction. You\u2019ll still be able to open the app from your app drawer, but only when you need to complete a task! The smartphone notification has become a scourge of modern society. People are always checking for new notifications and searching for the shot of dopamine they receive when they obtain new information. Linda Stone has the best phrase for the multitasking world we live in: continuous partial attention. It may sound jarring, but I recommend turning off all notifications. You won\u2019t miss them. In fact, there are many reasons why the biggest lovers of productivity, like the editor of this publication, are turning off their notifications. I know it can be an uncomfortable thought, but it will be worth the head space you\u2019re freeing up. Remember that all of the notifications are still on your phone; you don\u2019t need them to pop up and take control of your time. Turning off the notifications allows you to regain that control. Social media apps should be the first ones to go. You can still check your favorite social media apps if you need to, but don\u2019t let them distract you throughout the day! Shutting off these notifications puts you back in control. You\u2019d be surprised at how unimportant most of these notifications are. Are there any other apps that are needlessly notifying you? Maybe a photo sharing app telling you to remember the photo you took on this day 4 years ago? Perhaps you downloaded a game that keep reminding you of the latest high scores? We all have downloaded an app at some point that just starts notifying us when we least expect it. At the very least you need to disable these notifications. You may also want to reassess if you need the app on your phone at all. E-mail should be the next notification that you tackle. Yes, we all need to check e-mail throughout the day, but you don\u2019t need to be told when each and every new message has arrived in your inbox. Your postal mail carrier delivers all of your mail at one time, right? You don\u2019t receive each piece of mail individually, and your e-mail should be received the same way. Disable these email notifications, and just check your inbox a few times throughout the day. Texting and SMS are typically the most urgent messages that are received on a smart phone. This is the one area where I think it\u2019s okay to allow notifications. If your friends and family know that you\u2019re not checking the other notifications frequently, they can rely on the fact that you\u2019ll check your text messages. This doesn\u2019t mean that you need to drop everything and reply to each message on the spot, but if it\u2019s something urgent you\u2019ll know about it. Here\u2019s how you can turn off your notifications: 2. \u201cApps & Notifications\u201d 3. \u201cNotifications\u201d 4. \u201cApp notifications\u201d 5. You\u2019ll see a list of all the apps on your phone 6. Tap any app 7. Here you can toggle notifications on or off for any given app The beauty of this method is that it allows you to take control of your notifications. There may be some apps where you still want to allow notifications, but you can turn off the ones that you know are distracting you the most. We all need time to rest and recharge away from our smartphones. Fortunately, there are easy ways to disconnect during certain hours. All Android phones now allow you to set quiet or \u201cdo not disturb\u201d hours, during which your phone will be silent. Depending on your sleep schedule, I\u2019d recommend setting these for an hour before bedtime and an hour after you wake up. This allows you to have a wind down period when you\u2019re preparing for sleep when you\u2019re not checking your phone. It\u2019s also important to allow yourself some time to wake up in the morning and plan your day before you jump straight into checking your phone. Here\u2019s how you setup \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d on your phone: 2. Click \u201cSound\u201d 3. \u201cDo Not Disturb Preferences\u201d 4. This screen gives you options to set up different rules based on days of the week or special events. (Maybe you don\u2019t want to be disturbed after 8pm during the week, but you\u2019re okay with pushing it to 10pm on the weekends.) 5. Configure each rule as you see fit (Give it a name, days of the week, start & end time, and allow overrides if you\u2019d like) Everyone has a different schedule, and you\u2019ll obviously have different \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d hours that make sense for you. For me, not being disturbed between 9pm and 6am works really well any day of the week. Experiment for yourself until you find what works! Much has been written on how the blue light from our phones is keeping us awake at night. It\u2019s just not natural for human eyes to stare at such bright lights at all hours of the day. Sure, not looking at a phone at all is the best option. But the next best option is to calibrate your screen to block the blue light wavelength and go easy on your eyes. Some of the latest Android phones (from Samsung and LG specifically) come equipped with night time modes that dim the screen and reconfigure the wavelengths of the light being emitted. If your phone doesn\u2019t have this capability straight out of the box, I highly recommend downloading an app to help. My personal favorite is CF.lumen, but I\u2019ve also used Twilight in the past and it has worked well. Whichever app you choose, just set some initial parameters and then let it do its thing. Yes, there may be a few instances where the dimmed light is hard to see, so you can temporarily disable it as needed. But your eyes will surely thank you compared to the typical brightness of a phone screen. Here\u2019s how to setup a basic sleep filter that comes standard in the Android OS: 2. \u201cDisplay\u201d 3. \u201cNight Light\u201d 4. From here, you can customize exactly how you want your night light to work 5. Choose a custom on/off time 6. Set your desired intensity for the screen brightness For most people, this will be plenty. But if you\u2019re looking for some more advanced features, here is a quick guide on getting CF.lumen setup: 4. Tap on the \u201cLocation\u201d section to set your location. (don\u2019t be scared off by the longitude and latitude, the GPS on your phone will detect it automatically. This is used to calibrate the sunset and sunrise times for your location) 5. You\u2019ll want to set the \u201cSleep: Start time\u201d and \u201cSleep: End time\u201d to know the specific times to start the blue light filtering 6. Those are really the only required settings, the rest of the options are for power users to customize things. (For instance, you can make CF.lumen start automatically when you boot up your phone, or manually set up the color filter if you want to try something more extreme) Taking these steps will certainly improve your experience. But it\u2019s important to realize that every Android user needs to find their own personal balance of function and aesthetics. What works for me may not work for you. The beauty of the Android eco-system is that it\u2019s built on choice and customization. You may find that a clean home screen brings you joy but a blue light filter just frustrates you. That\u2019s okay! Only make changes that you think will genuinely improve your experience. We\u2019re staring at our phones for nearly 5 hours per day. You owe it to yourself to maximize the visual experience and efficiency of that time. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

I channel Tony Robbins for advice. Your phone is toxic to your relationships. You should put it down. Turn it off often. Agreed? So how come you haven\u2019t done it? Yeah. Me neither. There are days I check the thing every damn hour.Should I get a no-phone or a dumb-phone just for calls? Should I turn my screen black and white to make everything on the screen seem less enticing? Ugh, where do I start? And when? I started writing this piece in a coffee shop. From where I was sitting I could see the computer screen of the guest at the table next to me \u2014he was watching a Tony Robbins video. I don\u2019t know what the topic was. It doesn\u2019t even really matter. Something about that man makes me stop and try to listen every time I see his face. I imagine the script in my head, Tony saying, You, sir/ma\u2019am/person. Yes, you, hiding ijntge corner over there. Does your partner fucking use that dumb phone when you\u2019re together? Even when you\u2019re eating dinner or watching TV? Tony also swears like a sailor, which makes everything he says a little scary. But he\u2019s a gentle giant, which is probably why millions of people are drawn to his advice and his over-the-top book titles like Date with Destiny and Awaken the Giant Within. Watching him is sort of brainless because if you do it enough, you get his formula and you realize that the answer you want is already right there in your head. Want more meaningful time together? Shut the phone down. Want to focus more, feel more, relax more? Stop staring at the phone. The simplest way to use your phone less is to find people and activities thar interest you more. The answer is so clear. But most of us are too lazy or numb to even notice. That\u2019s when you need to channel your inner Tony: This is your life! By using the phone constantly, you have been taking life and putting up a door. In your case a wall. SHUT IT DOWN and destroy the wall. Everything you are seeking and desiring is right now inside of you and completely alive. The only thing that\u2019s stopping you? YOUR SMARTPHONE. Put it down. Ok, so I had seen the Tony Robbins video pretty much by chance. But, clearly, I couldn\u2019t get it out of my head. Back at my desk, I Google a few Tony Robbins quotes and find this one: Live life fully while here\u2026.take the opportunity to learn from your mistakes. Don\u2019t try to be perfect. Just be an excellent example of being human. My goal this Valentine\u2019s Day? It\u2019s to be with the people who make me forget to turn my phone on or even look at it.

Today, the news is dominated by Elon Musk running victory laps after the successful launch of the most powerful rocket since the Space Shuttle. The launch\u200a\u2014\u200aan admittedly impressive technical achievement that can be more accurately attributed to years of hard work by engineers and scientists rather than the whims of a rich, bored douchebag\u200a\u2014\u200ahas naturally inspired quite a degree of excitement. Most importantly, this is a prime opportunity for the media hivemind to engage in one of their favorite pastimes: gushing breathlessly about the antics of Elon Musk. Indeed, if you look at the past couple years of coverage of Musk, all the well-researched critical journalism is overshadowed by people tripping over themselves to have the most shared article singing his praises, all while broadly attributing SpaceX\u2019s work to one person: himself. This is ostensibly a piece of hard journalism on the launch by CNBC, but it seems far more interested in Musk than in the actual launch, and regurgitates his grandiose claims about the potential scope of his work without any scientific context or rebuttal: This, to be clear, is not adequate journalism: it is accidental PR, giving Musk a platform for his claims to be presented without scrutiny. It would take comparatively minimal effort to link to public documents that proved or disproved his claim that SpaceX used no public funding, or to note that evidence could not be found to prove the claim either way. The way we smooth over our grossly unequal reality is deeply dehumanizing, down to the fundamental way in which this has been described in the news almost singularly as Musk\u2019s achievement. But it isn\u2019t always such a blatant process\u200a\u2014\u200asometimes, its as simple as Bloomberg\u2019s (via TIME) choice to describe onlookers for a major rocket launch as Musk\u2019s \u201cfans\u201d, rather than people interested in one of the most American of all pastimes: watching a big thing blow up and/or go fast. The phenomenon is far more pronounced once you pass into the realm of opinions writing\u200a\u2014\u200awhich, it should be noted, is often treated in the popular eye with a level of disproportionate authority. One post in particular, \u201cElon Musk Does it Again\u201d from Scientific American, is so effusive in its praise that it recalls shades of the infamous Pitchfork Kid A review: While this may be effectively a blog post, it\u2019s still pretty demoralizing to see this lack of scrutiny in the esteemed Scientific American. The writer is tripping over himself to praise a wealthy man, and it\u2019s hard to take anything else he says seriously as a result. This dynamic has followed Musk everywhere\u200a\u2014\u200ait is difficult to find a similarly wealthy person whose ratio of positive to negative press is as grossly imbalanced as his. If you feel a need to delve further into this phenomenon, the search \u201cElon Musk saves world\u201d comes up with a pretty upsetting number of results. While many of those do indeed apply necessary skepticism to his lofty claims, many of them take it at face value. Unfortunately, there\u2019s a problem with reporting about the rich in such a lighthearted and non-confrontational manner. Musk and his ilk are modern-day robber-barons whose wealth comes at an immense human cost. As such, humanizing them effectively acts as free PR\u200a\u2014\u200aa counter-narrative to the violence of their wealth. This is a fundamental abdication of journalistic duty, one which allows the wealthiest, most powerful people alive to spout their narrative in many cases with limited-to-no pushback. Strangely, Musk is far more broadly popular than most billionaires. It\u2019s understandable to a degree: Musk is the deeply unfunny Reddit nerd we all know and loathe. Musk has a vocal interest in popular items of \u201cnerd culture\u201d\u00a0, makes grandiose-and-baseless statements about a vague desire to elevate the quality of life in the world, and lobs weak jokes on social media with the prowess of a 27 year old who thinks they can Tweet their way out of the seemingly endless banality of their own life. He\u2019s just like us! As a result, media outlets at all levels of renown have reported on tiny details of his personal life, making his interest in Rick and Morty somehow newsworthy. But really, he isn\u2019t, because again: he now has enough money to single-handedly end homelessness in the United States. There\u2019s a lot I can get into here about how Musk is a union-busting, worker-abusing, tax-evading, grossly negligent financier whose pet projects are draining funding and talent for actual infrastructure improvement and scientific development. If you\u2019re writing about Musk or any other billionaire, it is always relevant to note how people have accumulated wealth, and who they have harmed to do so. But even if Musk was, by all accounts, a paragon of a good person who followed the letter of the law, he\u2019d still be scum. Elon Musk is one of the fraction of a percent of people with the material wealth and power to impose near-instant improvement in people\u2019s lives, and chooses to use his astonishing wealth to\u2026 generate more wealth and pursue his pet projects. Moreover, to get to Musk\u2019s level of wealth, a person must do unspeakably evil things. You can\u2019t reach such wealth without actively denying someone else the right to an even minimally decent existence. Whether it\u2019s cutting corners, mistreating workers, bulldozing affordable housing and wildlife, or simply the banal evil of pursuing capital for its own sake, at a certain point you can\u2019t explain it away. Musk\u2019s pursuit of capital has cost people their homes, their jobs, their health, and their lives. He knows this, and he has continued\u200a\u2014\u200aaccelerated, even. It is the same choice every rich person makes. As such, Musk\u2019s fundamental contempt is laid bare: he has the capacity to do good, and actively chooses not to. It is astounding to me that such contempt is not immediately transparent to everyone else\u200a\u2014\u200awhich makes it all the more frustrating that people generally do not write or talk about Musk with such vitriol accordingly. In spite of this, Musk is generally considered to be altruistic in spite of the fact that he doesn\u2019t indulge in the same kind of performative, manipulative philanthropy efforts in the way people like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet have. His appeal comes from his admittedly lofty ambitions to change the world\u200a\u2014\u200ain his image. Elon Musk strives to impose his very narrow view of the future on the world writ large, his story of the future is invariably all about himself and his own ventures. Musk has crafted his rhetoric around SpaceX to paint his company as the only hope for space travel\u200a\u2014\u200aas the company that will take humanity to Mars. Thanks to a combination of the economic downturn and Bush administration cuts to NASA that ended the shuttle program, Musk has strived to paint SpaceX as a de facto private replacement for NASA. Ownership of space is impossible, but Musk aims for the next best thing: control over access and resources. In stoking public excitement, Musk doesn\u2019t aspire to raise humanity\u200a\u2014\u200ahe aspires to attract investors. SpaceX is, as such, effectively a very boring supervillain\u2019s plot. Unfortunately a good deal of people fall for Musk\u2019s egocentric view of progress, and it\u2019s hard to blame people who bite: everyone wants to believe improvement is tangible, easy, and inevitable\u200a\u2014\u200aMusk offers this in the form of a convenient narrative that paints him as an iconoclast pushing for the future, rather than as a petty oligarch cashing in on an untapped market. The weird, perverse phenomenon of admiration this inspires is best seen here, in an infographic slavishly devoted to singing his praises in documenting his life and work. Unintentionally, this infographic ends up being the most damning possible indictment of Musk, as it speculates on the future Musk envisions for himself (and the World, by extension): the peak of imagination for Musk and his acolytes is to see trips to Mars become an attainable luxury, a \u201cmere\u201d $200,000. This, of course, isn\u2019t intended as some unrealistic statement that space travel isn\u2019t costly\u200a\u2014\u200ait is instead a condemnation of priorities. Musk\u2019s end game here is to be the first person to space simply so he can own that market. You can see a similar phenomenon in any supposedly altruistic venture by these oligarchs: the best example, the Gates foundation, has become one of the most powerful non-state actors in the world by wielding so much money as to redefine international aid, and to make it inseparable from themselves and their whims. To bring this back to what this piece is ostensibly about, a CNN opinion piece titled \u201cElon Musk just launched our Breathtaking New Adventure\u201d drives this point home in the vision of the future they paint: This is why the way we gush over the Randian exploits of rich nerds is so dangerous: people actually buy it. In this grandiose prayer of thanks for Musk and the free market, the author notably omits the billions of dollars in federal funding that Musk has received for SpaceX. Not only is this directly taking resources that, yes, come from taxpayers, this is money not going to benefit programs or to scientific efforts aimed at the general good. In short, we are still paying for it, but we\u2019re not even getting anything out of it. Not without a \u201cmodest\u201d $200,000 and a lifetime of waiting, at least. Again: what happened today was an incredible achievement, but it is an achievement that does not belong to Musk, much as he will reap all the credit for it. This was the work of engineers, physicists, programmers, factory workers, janitors, and their neglected families as all of them worked inhumane hours to realize Musk\u2019s childish fantasies and cynical ambitions alike. They should all be incredibly proud of what they accomplished. Musk just made some dumb tweets and stuck a car in it, all while holding their lives hostage with the implicit contract that binds all workers under capital: work for me if you want to eat. When you read about the rich, their description almost always includes a number: their net worth. But this number has a never-mentioned story told through the unspeakable things a rich person had to do to get that wealth. When you omit that story without even an acknowledgement, the implicit statement is that it doesn\u2019t matter\u200a\u2014\u200athat the lives ruined and ended to accumulate this wealth do not matter. But we will keep treating rich tyrants like Musk with kid gloves because it\u2019s profitable. These rich idiots are the ones who cut the checks anyways. And so, for now, the cycle continues: The narrative of human history is one of deluded individuals who see God as a tyrant, and model themselves in his image in their desire to wield power over others. They are propped up in equal measure by sycophants who see a route to comfort, and the dispossessed who have no means to stop them. You do not have to keep worshiping these false gods. And at the very least, you don\u2019t have to write about them so breathlessly. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out. Waiting patiently for the Heat Death of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

A black car arrived and drove us to downtown Chicago. I was a junior at New Trier High School, living Monday to Friday with the Thomas family in Kenilworth, a fancy suburb. Claire, unlike me, was not a kid when we got asylum in the United States, so nobody sent her to school or took her in. Instead, she worked as a maid, cleaning 200 hotel rooms a week. All I knew about The Oprah Winfrey Show we were taping was that it was a two-part series: the first, a segment of Oprah and Elie Wiesel visiting Auschwitz, God help us; the second, the 50 winners of Oprah\u2019s high school essay contest, of which I was one. All of us winners had written about why Wiesel\u2019s book Night, his gutting story of surviving the Holocaust, is still relevant today. I dictated my essay to Mrs. Thomas, my American mother, who packed my lunch and drove me to school. I said that maybe if Rwandans had read Night, they wouldn\u2019t have decided to kill each other. Oprah sat on stage on a white love seat, next to tired, old Elie Wiesel, who sat in a white overstuffed chair. Oprah said glowing things about all the winners except me, which I told myself was fine. I hadn\u2019t really gone to school until age 13, and when I was seven, I\u2019d celebrated Christmas with a shoebox of pencils that I\u2019d buried under our tent so that nobody would steal it. But then Oprah leaned forward and said, \u201cSo, Clemantine, before you left Africa, did you ever find your parents?\u201d I had a mic cord tucked under my black TV blazer and a battery pack clipped to my black TV pants, so I should have known something like this was coming. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cSo when was the last time you saw them?\u201d Oprah asked. \u201cIt was 1994,\u201d I said, \u201cwhen I had no idea what was going on.\u201d \u201cWell, I have a letter from your parents,\u201d Oprah said, like we\u2019d won a game show. \u201cClemantine and Claire, come on up here!\u201d Claire kept on her toughest, most skeptical face, because she knows more about the world than I do. I leapt up onto the set smiling, because I learned some really useful skills as a refugee\u200a\u2014\u200alike, I always could read what people wanted me to do. \u201cThis is from your family, in Rwanda,\u201d Oprah said, handing me a tan envelope. \u201cFrom your father and your mother and your sisters and your brother.\u201d Claire and I did know that our parents were alive, but we\u2019d barely talked to them because\u200a\u2014\u200ahow do you start? Why didn\u2019t you look harder for us? How are you? I\u2019m fine, thanks, now working at Gap, and I\u2019ve found it\u2019s much easier to learn to read English if you also listen to audio books? I opened the envelope and pulled out a sheet of blue paper. Then Oprah, thank God, put her hand on mine. She stopped me from unfolding it, a huge relief. I didn\u2019t want to have a breakdown on TV. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to read it right now, in front of all these people,\u201d Oprah said, mercifully. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to read it in front of all these people\u2026.\u201d She paused, grandmaster of stagecraft that she is. \u201cBecause\u2026 because\u2026 your family\u2026. IS HERE!\u201d I started walking backward. Claire\u2019s jaw unhinged, a caricature of shock. Then a door, that weirdly had images of barbed wire on it, opened stage right and out ran an eight year old boy, who was apparently my brother. He was followed by my father, in a dark suit, salmon shirt, and tie; a shiny new five-year-old sister; my mother in a long blue dress; and my sister, Claudine, now taller than me, who I\u2019d last seen her when she was two and I still believed my mother picked her from a banana tree. I\u2019d fantasized and prayed about this moment so many times. I used to write my name in dust on buses, hoping my mother would see my loopy cursive \u201cClemantine\u201d and realize that I was alive. I saved coins, so I could buy my parents presents. Claire remained frozen. But I, in my newly-purchased TV clothes and blown-out hair, ran toward my family, arms outstretched. I hugged my brother. I hugged my father. I hugged my tiny little sister. I tried to hug my mother but my knees gave out\u200a\u2014\u200aI guess I was a cartoon, too\u200a\u2014\u200aand my mother had to pick me up. Then I hugged her. I hugged Claudette. I walked across the stage and hugged Oprah and the lovely, weathered Eli Wiesel. The cameras were so far away that I forgot I was participating in a million-viewer spectacle, though I was aware enough to realize that everybody in the audience was crying, including the one other Rwandan essay contest winner. I wiped my eyes, put my hand on her shoulder, and said, \u201cMy mother is your mother, too,\u201d which probably offended the hell out of her. Then we were ejected onto the sidewalk outside Harpo Studios and my whole new family took a black car north to my sister\u2019s apartment. Nobody knew what to do. My mother kept sitting down and standing up, and touching everything, and singing about how God had protected us and now we must serve and love him. My father kept smiling, like someone he mistrusted was taking pictures of him. Claire remained catatonic; I thought she\u2019d finally gone crazy, for real. I sat on Claire\u2019s couch, looking at my strange new siblings, the ones that had replaced me and Claire. I fell asleep crying and woke still wearing my Oprah shoes. The next day was Friday. Of course, I didn\u2019t go to school. I couldn\u2019t look at my parents\u200a\u2014\u200athey were ghosts. I felt gratitude, sure, but I also felt kicked in the stomach, like my life was some sicko psychologist\u2019s perverse experiment: Let\u2019s see how far can we take a person down, and then how far can her raise her up, and then let\u2019s see what happens! My mother loved to garden in my early childhood home, so Saturday we went to the Chicago Botanical Garden. We did Navy Pier\u200a\u2014\u200aFerris wheel, cotton candy, all the tourist stuff. My father kept smiling his fake, pained smile. Claire never said a word. Then, Monday morning, my parents and new siblings left on the flight back to Rwanda that Oprah\u2019s people had booked for them. I caught a Red Line and then the Purple Line train back up to Kenilworth. Mrs. Thomas picked me up at the station and dropped me at school. When I was a regular child, I lived in Kigali, Rwanda, and I was a precocious snoop. My nickname was Cassette. I repeated everything I saw or heard, including that my sister Claire, who is nine years older than me, wore shorts under her skirt and played soccer instead of doing her family errands after school. My mother spent her mornings at church and her afternoons in the garden, where she taught me the names of plants\u200a\u2014\u200acauliflower, birds of paradise\u200a\u2014\u200aand how to care for each, which needed to be in the cool soil under the mango tree and which needed the warm sun. My father owned a car service. He worked hard, often late into the night, and some afternoons he came home to nap. I knew that I was meant to be quiet while he slept, that I was supposed to stop screaming and shaking the branches of the mango tree, pretending that it was a bus that would take me and my brother to Canada or Butare. But one day I forgot. My father, who\u2019d never punished me before, called me into the den and slapped me in the face. That was the most cruelty I\u2019d ever seen. In 1993, when I was five, I started kindergarten. I considered myself the most special child there, maybe the most special child in the whole world, because one day my nanny picked me up carrying a rain coat and kelly green rain boots that had belonged to Claire, and she also told me stories that made sense of the world, like that the gods shook out the ocean like a rug to make waves. But that nanny, who I loved, disappeared. A few months later my new nanny came to kindergarten to pick me up. On our way home, we passed a group of men singing, dancing, and drumming in the street, on a corner where we often bought sugar. I wanted to stop and dance with them\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019d never seen these people before, so it was exciting and exotic, and the dancers were blocking the dusty road anyway, not letting cars pass. But that nanny, who had a history of plying my patience with mandazi, or beignets, so that she could talk to her friends, refused. At home I tattled. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have walked that way,\u201d my mother said to her sharply. A few days later that nanny disappeared. I never went to kindergarten again. You know those little pellets you drop in water that expand into huge sponges? My life was the opposite. Everything shrunk. I was forbidden to play in the mango tree, then forbidden to play outside. Our curtains, which my mother threw open at five each morning, suddenly remained closed. The drumming began, loud and far away. Then the car horns. My father stopped working after dark. My mother quit going to church. Instead she prayed in my room, where my whole family now slept, because it had the smallest window. We ate dinner with the lights off. My parents\u2019 faces turned into faces I had never seen, and I heard noises that I did not understand\u200a\u2014\u200anot screaming, worse. My parents whispered and I eavesdropped. I heard them say that some robbers had ransacked our neighbor\u2019s house and left a note saying they\u2019d soon return for their girls. By then I was six. No one would explain anything to me\u200a\u2014\u200ano parable for the world closing in on itself, like the sky kissing the ground to make the morning dew. Then one day my mother told Claire to pack a few things, to go to my grandmother\u2019s farm, which we loved. At her house we never even wore shoes. The next morning a van from my father\u2019s car service arrived. My mother handed me a bag and put me in the van alongside Claire. She made me promise to behave. She hugged us and said she\u2019d see us soon. On the way out of Kigali, we stopped to pick up two of my cousins\u200a\u2014\u200agirls Claire\u2019s age. The driver knocked on the door. Nobody came out. We stopped at other houses; other girls entered the van. We all squished together in the middle of the bench seats, away from the windows. For some time we crouched on the floor. Claire told me we needed to play the silent game. The drive took forever. We didn\u2019t even stop to eat kabobs or buy the soap that we always brought to my grandmother as a gift. At my grandmother\u2019s, some of my uncles and cousins were already in her kitchen, the older girls peeling potatoes like city girls\u200a\u2014\u200anot well. I idolized these cousins, their black freckles and fancy clothes. My grandmother circled them like a lion, livid. Earlier that day they\u2019d snuck out of her house and walked down the street, to borrow a neighbor\u2019s skin lotion. Every hour I demanded an update on when my parents were coming\u200a\u2014\u200aor at least my brother, who we called Pudi, because he loved Puma and Adidas. My grandmother, cousins, and sister all just said, \u201cSoon.\u201d Nobody would play with me. I felt outraged at my mistreatment. I stopped eating and bathing and refused to let anyone touch my hair. After a few nights my grandmother said, with zero enthusiasm, \u201cLet\u2019s play hide and seek,\u201d and she took me, Claire, and my cousins to a different house to sleep. The following night she said, \u201clet\u2019s hide again.\u201d This time she told us to climb inside the deep pit in the ground that was used to make banana wine. When it happened, we heard a knock on the door. My grandmother gestured for us to be silent and then, she motioned for us to run, or really, to belly-crawl through the sweet potato field. I carried a blanket, which turned out to be a towel. Claire pulled my arm. Once we crawled through the field and reached the tall trees, we ran, for real, off the farm and deep into a thick banana grove, where we saw other people, most of them young, some of them bloody with wounds. We walked for hours, until everything hurt, not toward anything, just away. We crouched down by a stream to drink. I started shivering, despite the heat, and said to Claire, \u201cI want to go home.\u201d She stood up, yanked my wrist, and said, \u201cWe can\u2019t stay here. Other people will come.\u201d That night it rained a sticky, thick syrup. I held on to Claire\u2019s shirt, too exhausted to hold hands. A woman tried to give us food, but we were too afraid to take it. A man told us he knew the way to safety. We followed him to the Burundi border, to the Akanyaru River. There were bodies floating in it. I was so young that I assumed they were asleep. All my toe nails fell out. We lived off fruit. We found an abandoned house and spent the day hidden under a bed. After days, a week\u200a\u2014\u200awho could keep track?\u200a\u2014\u200awe found a cornfield where we heard children playing. Their cries now sounded exotic. Hadn\u2019t the whole world changed? Claire decided that we needed to find these playing children\u2019s parents. When we did she told them that we\u2019d come from over the hill and that our family would follow soon. The mother accepted this non-explanation and took us to her one-room hut where she slept with her family on a bed of straw. All night I itched. In the morning I woke with welts and the children laughed at me for not knowing what lice was. We stayed there, working in the fields and eating boiled corn and sweet potatoes with no oil or salt\u200a\u2014\u200athe worst cooked food I\u2019d ever consumed. Then a few weeks later, we saw people walking down the roads, hundreds, maybe thousands, carrying bags, children, baskets, and faded clothes on their heads. One man carried a dog. Claire decided we needed to join them. \u201cWhat if you go and you don\u2019t find anything?\u201d the mother of the hut asked us. Claire said, \u201cWe need to go.\u201d When we first landed in the United States, in O\u2019Hare Airport, people holding WELCOME TO AMERICA signs gave us balloons and gift bags with $100 pre-paid cards for Limited Too. On my first day of school, I woke up at 5:00 a.m. and ironed my Limited Too sweater and jeans. By that point I was 13, so I was put in sixth grade. Claire walked me down to school an hour early. We noticed kids walking into the cafeteria and eating a free breakfast, so like a good refugee, I walked into the cafeteria and ate the free breakfast, too. At the end of that year my teacher told our sponsor at church that I really should be in a better school. So our sponsor asked around the community and the Thomases, also members of the church, agreed to take me in. I lived with their family Monday to Friday. It was amazing, and I felt so overwhelmed. Mrs. Thomas read with me everyday\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Boxcar Children, The Little Prince. She hired me tutors and brought me on family vacations to Florida, but I didn\u2019t want get too close: no I-love-you\u2019s, no kisses goodnight. My sole focus was bootstrapping, working the American system, picking myself up out of my depths like some international Horatio Alger. At school, the cheerleaders looked happy, so I became a cheerleader. I ran on the track team. I acted in the school\u2019s improv troupe. I peer counseled. I even fundraised with my school\u2019s Aid for Africa club. Sometimes I misfired. Once I signed up for a church youth camping trip, which I didn\u2019t quite process because Mrs. Thomas packed my bags for me. Then I arrived at Big Foot Beach State Park, looked around, and thought, what is this nightmare? Why on earth would you pay and sleep in a tent by choice? Around town, some people treated me like an egg, the poor, fragile refugee girl. People wanted to help in the ways that they wanted to help. One day one of Mrs. Thomas\u2019s friends picked me up at school in her convertible, handed me a pair of sunglasses, and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going shopping today. Call me Auntie Wilma.\u201d She became my godmother of shopping. We drove to Nordstrom\u2019s. \u201cOkay, here\u2019s how it works,\u201d she said. \u201cYou buy things you can mix with things you already have. It\u2019s not only about trend but what will last longer.\u201d I liked clothes\u200a\u2014\u200aand my new Auntie Wilma was being sweet; as much as anything, she wanted to teach me about my growing body. But I was also thinking, \u201cWhy are you doing this? Why should I care?\u201d On Fridays, I rode the L down to Rogers Park, stopping along the way at Blockbuster to spend the allowance the Thomases gave me on buckets of popcorn, soda, and rented movies. At Claire\u2019s apartment, I made a pillow fort and spent the night inside snacking and watching movies with Claire\u2019s kids\u200a\u2014\u200aMariette, eight; Frederick, five; and Michelle, two. My sister had so much responsibility. In addition to being a young mother, she was an extraordinary survivor. So just like we did in Africa, I took care of her children while she hustled and worked. Saturday mornings she headed to downtown Chicago to clean rooms at the Wyndham Hotel. I made pancakes and ice cream for breakfast for her three kids, then did all her family\u2019s laundry, cooked, and froze meals for her family for the week, and made sure Mariette, Frederick, Michelle had plans after school. On Sundays, like good Rwandans, we went to church and pretended everything was great. That seemed to be the official policy of Rwandan culture: chin up, clothes ironed, don\u2019t stand out. Sunday night, I returned to my life as a pampered child in suburban Kenilworth. Claire never resented it. She never knew that Mrs. Thomas made me three meals a day and that at the Thomases\u2019 house I had a big cozy bedroom, my own bathroom, and no cockroaches. A year after Oprah, Claire became a citizen and flew back to Rwanda, where my parents now lived on the outskirts of Kigali, in a shack. They\u2019d lost everything in what people were calling the intambara\u200a\u2014\u200aKinyarwanda for \u201ceruption\u201d or \u201cexplosion\u201d; how are you supposed to capture 800,000 people being killed by their friends and neighbors in 100 days? Two months after that first trip, Claire flew to Rwanda again, and this time brought my mother and youngest sister back to live in the United States. A few months later, my father, younger brother, and sister. Then my life became even more surreal. Like Claire, my parents didn\u2019t talk about the past. They existed in a never-ending present, not asking too many questions, not allowing themselves to feel, moving forward inside a small, tidy life. Now on weekends, at Claire\u2019s house, I\u2019d see my little sister, who was six, jump into my mother\u2019s lap\u200a\u2014\u200alike anybody could just jump into our mother\u2019s lap. She\u2019d beg for my mother\u2019s attention\u200a\u2014\u200alike all lucky little girls do. One Sunday, while I was doing my homework, I heard my mother in the kitchen, prepping beef stew and singing. When she finished, she sat next to me at the table, the first time we sat together like that in 14 years. Her dark skin didn\u2019t match mine. Her hair was short and tight against her head\u200a\u2014\u200aI remembered it as long. Her fingernails were chipped. Her lips were parched. Her singing sounded strange. The fantasy of reunion was a lie. No one could patch up my family and make it beautiful. The only things about my mother that conformed to my memory were her cheekbones and the white rosary she wore around her neck. I ran to the bathroom and turned on the shower on full blast. After 20 minutes, Claire knocked on the door, annoyed. \u201cYou are not taking a bath. Why are your eyes red?\u201d she asked harshly. \u201cHave you been crying? What happened?\u201d It\u2019s strange, how you go from a being person who is away from home to a person with no home at all. The country that is supposed to want you has pushed you out. No other country takes you in. You are unwanted, by everyone. You are a refugee. One day when we were walking with our sorry group, a Red Cross truck arrived. The driver invited the pregnant and wounded among us to get on. The rest of us were told to follow, until we arrived at two hills covered with blue and white tents. I started screaming, \u201cPudi! PU-DI!\u201d, sure my brother would be here. Eventually the UNHCR aid workers corralled me back in line, to stand next to Claire. When we reached the front of the cue, a woman grabbed my hand and pushed it into a bucket of purple ink. The dye meant I had been counted. Nobody asked my name\u200a\u2014\u200atoo many people for names. We were given a tent, scratchy blankets, and a pot. A man pointed to the part of the hill where we should pitch our tent and to the hollow between the two hills where we should stand in line, once a month, to fill a plastic bag with maize and beans. For a few hours I remained giddy\u200a\u2014\u200aof course, we\u2019d find our parents here. Then I looked around. Hundreds of sick on the ground, moaning. Dozens of wounded, yelling. The camp bathroom was located near the ditch that aid workers had dug for dead bodies. I was afraid to go; Claire wasn\u2019t\u200a\u2014\u200ashe was as hard as amber by then. But within a month, I too had built a tough, shellacked veneer. Each morning I walked two or three hours to fetch water and wood. Once at the pump, I waited in line for an hour more. The other women, who were probably only 17, tried to bully me out of my spot. \u201cAre you going to able to carry that gallon? It\u2019s bigger than your head. It\u2019s bigger than your whole body.\u201d I threw toward them my newly mastered do-not-fuck-with-me stare, which I\u2019d developed by telling myself that I was twice as old and five times stronger than these pathetic women, who could only cope with their lives by making a six-year-old feel small. Soon after, a handsome Congolese CARE worker declared that he was in love with Claire. Claire knew that we were targets, two girls without a guardian; she instructed me never to accept gifts like candy or bread. She told the CARE worker\u200a\u2014\u200awho I\u2019m going to call Rob and who, at the time, seemed extremely sophisticated and put-together, due to his well-cut hair, striped shirts, and shiny shoes\u200a\u2014\u200athat she was too young to get involved, that the last thing she needed was to be a 16-year-old refugee without any parents and a little sister and baby to care for. But he persisted. \u201cMe, I want to marry you,\u201d Rob said daily. \u201cMe, I want to marry you. You can go to school.\u201d He claimed that he\u2019d fallen in love with Claire on the day we entered the camp, and that if she married him, we could move to Congo and live with his mother. After a few months, Claire broke down\u200a\u2014\u200aof course she did. This life wasn\u2019t going to lead anywhere anyway, and marriage (however personally problematic) was a lottery ticket out. Marriage came with papers. Besides, I had Claire to look after me, and Claire had no one to look after her. Claire and Rob married, surrounded by a few envious refugees and Rob\u2019s friends and co-workers. The best things about the day were the mandazi and reception sodas. After the wedding, Rob, for once, did his part. He helped us get the documents we needed to move to his mother\u2019s, or really, his uncle\u2019s house, in Uvira, DR Congo. My first few weeks there I constantly stood on the bed and touched the ceiling. We\u2019d been sleeping outside for a year and a half. In Uvira, Claire got pregnant and everybody wanted to be my mother. Women would scrub my feet and bring me their daughters\u2019 dresses. They\u2019d say, \u201cWhat is this mess?\u201d and then fix my hair. Rob\u2019s cousins, children close to my age, also lived in the house. We shared big plates of rice, eggplant, and fish stew. I ate the slowest. In March 1996, Claire, then age 17, went to the hospital, like a semi-regular person, and Mariette was born. I felt so loved and cared for. I attended a few months of first grade. I even started to forget Rwanda. Maybe this life in Congo was real and before was just a dream? But then the people started streaming from Bukavu, northeast into Uvira, fleeing the war breaking out between Mobutu and Kabila, knocking on doors of houses, including our house, begging for food. Rob\u2019s family cooked extra fish stew and rice and took people in, but still they kept coming, stumbling off buses, flooding the markets, emptying the shelves. Claire realized this would only get worse and collected her jewelry and clothes, anything she could sell. She decided we needed to flee. Entering Tanzania from Congo required crossing Lake Tanganyika, the deepest lake in Africa, a six-hour trip. Fifty frantic people, carrying their whole lives, crammed with us onto a small boat. We started taking on water as soon as we left the shore. The only way to slow our sinking was to make our boat lighter, to trade possessions for lives. So people started dropping heirlooms\u200a\u2014\u200aframed pictures, silver, jewelry\u200a\u2014\u200aand watching them sink. One woman tossed her china plates, one by one; then she started on glass teacups. Still the cold water kept rising, creeping up the adults\u2019 shins, over my knees. I prayed to every saint that I could remember\u200a\u2014\u200aMary, Rose, Katherina. I promised God that if we made it to the other side he could kill me any way he wanted. I just didn\u2019t want to die like this. Claire held Mariette, then eight months old, up to her chest. We reached Tanzania traumatized and exhausted and fell asleep near Lake Tanganyika\u2019s edge. In the morning police rounded us up and put us in a boat. We resumed being refugees. The college financial aid forms asked: How much do your parents make\u200a\u2014\u200aand I was, like, which parents? Do you have family members who fought in the Civil War\u200a\u2014\u200awhich civil war? My New Trier High School advisor laughed when I showed him my list of schools: Princeton, Yale, Georgetown. He thought I should aim lower. Everybody did. But then I got a letter: waitlisted at Yale. I flew to New Haven, in the spring of 2008, and walked into the Dean of Admission\u2019s office to convince him that I belonged there, at Yale, that I deserved a place among the world\u2019s future leaders, that if people wanted to make the world a better place, I knew what to fix. He called the next week and offered me a full scholarship. My writing in English was still not that great, so the Dean arranged for a post-grad scholarship year at Hotchkiss. Mrs. Thomas drove me out to Connecticut. She\u2019d never been at an East coast boarding school before. Her own kids attended high-status universities\u200a\u2014\u200aDuke, American, St. Olaf College\u200a\u2014\u200abut as we drove onto the hundred-year-old estate of a campus, complete with boat house, cemetery, and two hockey rinks, Mrs. Thomas looked proud and confused. She\u2019d done this: her family\u2019s generosity had made Hotchkiss possible for me. But at some level, she expected life to have a certain order. Me being here wasn\u2019t it. Claire always taught me everything is yours, everything is not yours. The world owes you nothing; nobody deserves more or less than the next person. Even as a refugee she always kept one dignified outfit\u200a\u2014\u200aearly on, a crisp white blouse, well-fitting flare jeans, short black boots; later, a brown suit\u200a\u2014\u200aso she could present herself to anybody, anywhere, as a smart, enterprising young woman, period. She asked no pity, no permission. She was a fact of life, an equal. Nobody needed to know more. At Hotchkiss, Claire\u2019s attitude, along with my refugee skills, served me well: Whose behavior do I model to achieve in this place? Who has real power and who is bluffing? Where are the dangers and how do I escape? My ability to hack the system got me there, into those long halls filled with portraits of pale, square-jawed men. But it couldn\u2019t protect me from my inner life. I was also alone for the first time, away from Claire and the Thomases. I was 20 and felt so old and so young. One day, in a philosophy seminar, I sat around a table with my fellow students, the boys in sports jackets, the girls in sweaters. It was a beautiful, crisp fall day. The professor gave us a thought experiment: You\u2019re a ferry captain with two passengers. Your boat is sinking. One passenger is old and one is young. Who do you save? With this, my veneer of decorum started to crack. Before I arrived on campus I asked the headmaster not to share my history. Nobody knew who I was. \u201cDo you want to know what\u2019s that really like?\u201d I blurted out. \u201cThis is an abstract question to you?\u201d Everybody stared. A few weeks later, around that same seminar table\u200a\u2014\u200amahogany, with a view of the golf course\u200a\u2014\u200athe professor asked us all to share the presentations we\u2019d prepared on whether or not to send troops into a Black Hawk Down-like war scenario, like in Somalia. I cracked for real. \u201cYou have no idea, do you?\u201d I yelled as one girl spoke. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been in that scenario. What gives you a right to even talk? This is real. That\u2019s me\u200a\u2014\u200aand I have a name, and I\u2019m alive and there are people out there who are dead, or they\u2019re living but they\u2019re checked out, and they hate the world because people in your country sat there and watched all of us getting slaughtered.\u201d I ran out of class. When I returned to fetch my bag, the professor asked me to meet him later in his office. He was in his mid-50s, with a salt-and-pepper beard, contained but kind. He told me that I needed to learn how to be a less emotional student. I did not agree. \u201cI can\u2019t be less emotional. It\u2019s personal,\u201d I said, all the while thinking that I didn\u2019t survive all that horror to sip tea and join his club. I dropped the seminar and started therapy. The following fall, at Yale, I tried again\u200a\u2014\u200apsychology, history, and political science classes, to learn about the world abstractly. But those courses didn\u2019t help me make sense of my life. I found them unnerving, intellectualized, and cold. So I built a private curriculum. My sophomore year I signed up for a class on the intense, inscrutable German writer W. G. Sebald because Sebald had written a book called On the Natural History of Destruction, and that sounded like my history. Sebald dropped into his books random-seeming photographs of libraries, eyes, animals, windows, and trees, as a way to try to capture the mass amnesia that fell over his country after the Second World War. Ever since my freakout at Hotchkiss, I\u2019d been on a mission to piece together who I was. I\u2019d been looking at my hands\u200a\u2014\u200athey were my mother\u2019s hands. I\u2019d been looking at my feet\u200a\u2014\u200amy right foot in particular, it looked like my father\u2019s foot. I knew I couldn\u2019t understand myself through my American family or my classmates in their YALE sweatshirts and J. Crew skirts, even though I dressed like them. But I had so few concrete artifacts from my past\u200a\u2014\u200ajust a vinyl pencil case from South Africa and a photograph of myself at age four, dressed up for my aunt\u2019s wedding, that I\u2019d now hidden so deep that I could no longer find it. But Sebald offered a method, a technique for navigating out of the fog: He implied that if a person wades deep enough into memory, and pays close enough attention to the available clues, a narrative will emerge that makes moral and emotional sense. I read all of Sebald\u2019s books\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Rings of Saturn, The Emigrants, Vertigo. Then I started rereading. I also made a practice each day of walking by Annette, a woman who stood in front of Graduate Hall with a bucket of flowers that she purchased in bunches at the grocery store and sold as singles for a tiny profit. She was a fighter. Almost nobody noticed her until she called out, \u201cHey, sugar, come buy some of my flowers.\u201d She had nothing to do with most students\u2019 impressive, Ivy League lives. But to me she was a clue, a link to a buried past, a reminder of my sister who used to sell anything\u200a\u2014\u200asalt, meat\u200a\u2014\u200aso that she could save enough money for us to try to escape our deadening refugee lives. I had so many questions. Why did I use the GPS map on my phone, even on campus, when I knew where I was going? Why did I obsessively collect buttons and beads? Why did I talk so much\u200a\u2014\u200awas I afraid I\u2019d disappear? After Annette, I turned down Hillhouse Avenue and took pictures of the roots and vines growing outside the Yale cemetery. Then I studied the patterns in the images to see if they matched the patterns of the veins in my hands. Once back in my dorm room, I retreated to the nest of pillows I built on my bed and pulled out my worn copy of Austerlitz, Sebald\u2019s novel about a middle-aged man, who, as an infant, was shipped out of Czechoslovakia by his Jewish parents on the kindertransport, though nobody ever told him this. I twisted my earbuds to listen to Austerlitz on audiobook as I read. When my fair, green-eyed boyfriend, Ian, returned from his day\u200a\u2014\u200apolitical science, crew team\u200a\u2014\u200aI said, \u201cListen to this! Everything is connected!\u201d I\u2019d been with Ian for two years. I loved him and clung to him, but he often joked that I was having a more intense relationship with Sebald than I was with him. And it was true, in a way: I did want Ian to care more about Sebald, to interrogate the details of his own life. For instance, Ian was constantly playing and twisting pieces of paper or anything small in his hands, a nervous tic. But he wasn\u2019t inclined to assigning much meaning to this, he didn\u2019t want to investigate why he behaved as he behaved. \u201cClemantine, you\u2019re so weird,\u201d Ian said, gently dismissing me. Still, my own interrogations did not feel optional. Why did I drink only tea, never cold water? Why did I cringe when the sun turned red? Claire never spoke while we walked, and she never told me where we were going. She just moved, upright and aggressive, from six in the morning until three in the afternoon, an overstuffed nylon bag in each hand, a sun-bleached cloth wrapped around her head, Mariette tied to her back. She didn\u2019t care if I walked slowly or if I walked quickly, or if, in my eight-year-old absurdity, I carried a Mickey Mouse backpack filled with rocks that I collected to try to keep track of where we\u2019d been. Claire also didn\u2019t care if I was: thirsty, exhausted, hungry, hot, despairing, confused, or lonely. She didn\u2019t care if the grass cut my legs or if, now that I\u2019d outgrown my sneakers, my cheap plastic shoes burned my feet. Claire didn\u2019t care that Rob terrified me. He joined us in Tanzania after he, too, lost everything: his job, his home. And now that he was a refugee as well he wanted to broadcast his pain. Claire didn\u2019t care\u200a\u2014\u200aor at least show me that she cared\u200a\u2014\u200aif Rob abused her. Within hours of fleeing my grandmother\u2019s house, Claire made a hard, subconscious calculus: she could survive, and maybe enable me to survive too, but only if she cast off emotional responsibility, only if she refused to take on how anything or anybody felt. The Tanzania camp was horrible\u200a\u2014\u200anot enough space or tents, day-long lines to bathe. Claire decided this was not a life that we could accept. She couldn\u2019t spend one empty, hopeless, soul-destroying day waiting around for the next. So she sold most of her clothes and all her jewelry and we started walking again, endless days moving toward nothing I could understand, avoiding roads and refusing the comfort of joining larger groups, as roads and numbers increased the already miserable odds that we\u2019d get caught and thrown in jail or sent back to a camp. We walked and got on cargo trucks when we could, until immigration picked us up and put us in a camp in Malawi. There, Claire followed a Somalian man selling black-market goat meat to his source, and she started selling meat as well. Once she saved enough money, we headed off again, south from Malawi through Mozambique, over 500 miles, through a mix of lush hills, palms, and desert plants that looked like the outskirts of Austin, Texas. Eventually immigration caught us again, and separated us from Rob. Claire\u2019s stoicism gave way to fury. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed?\u201d she screamed at our captors. \u201cDo you know how hungry these children are? We walked from my country that\u2019s at war.\u201d I said, \u201cYeah. Yeah. Yeah,\u201d her self-appointed chorus. It was a relief to be away from Rob but we were scared. Two girls and a baby\u200a\u2014\u200awe needed him. Rob was our door, our barrier against more predatory men. The next day the guards let us go. Once again, walking, Claire resumed her silence. I knew by that point that Rob wanted to leave me behind. Unlike Claire, he did care that I walked slowly and she did not defend me against him when he made me abandon my beloved, ridiculous Mickey Mouse backpack. I couldn\u2019t look at her\u200a\u2014\u200awhat if she saw my anger? My black pit of need? We walked another week or two, south toward Maputo, until immigration again picked us up and put us in a camp, this one surprisingly nice and run by Italians. I wanted to stay forever, but Claire felt staying in a good camp was even worse than staying in a bad one\u200a\u2014\u200awhat if we started to think this life was okay? Our second morning there, I polished her black boots. She put on her white blouse and flare jeans and she snuck off for a nearby town. The Italians who ran the camp fed the refugees by distributing boxes of pasta. Claire cut a deal with an Indian man who ran a grocery store. He paid Claire five Mozambican metical per box of pasta. Claire bought boxes off the refugees for one. In three months, she made enough money to buy us bus tickets to the South African border. For a while, most of 1997, we had a semi-normal life\u200a\u2014\u200ano walking, no camps, no murder. Claire, Rob, Mariette, and I lived in one room of an apartment packed with refugees. Rob found work cutting hair. Claire cleaned houses. Mariette was my world, everyday. I fussed over her outfits, hovered and overprotected, just like I wished someone would do for me. That was the happiest I\u2019d been since we\u2019d left home. I focused on Mariette, tried hard to forget Rwanda, and almost succeeded. But then Claire got pregnant again, and that made her desperate to try to return to home, to see if our parents were still alive. I resented everything about back-tracking to Rwanda. Why return to that hell? The only place on our way that I didn\u2019t hate the thought of returning to was Congo, where we had what seemed like a family and a dozen women who brought me ironed dresses for church, braided my hair, and scrubbed my feet. But by the time we arrived\u200a\u2014\u200athree years after we left, Claire by this point five months pregnant\u200a\u2014\u200athe war had destroyed Congo. It was toppled and covered in ash, like a child had kicked over and burned a building-block town. Rob\u2019s family huddled in their house, starving, living on sweet potato leaves. I spent my days, once again, under a bed, pushed away from the window, into the middle of the room, huddled so close to Mariette and Rob\u2019s cousins that we could feel each other shake and breathe. Claire did go to the hospital to give birth to Frederick, but even that building was bombed a few hours after he was born, so Claire wrapped him in a blanket and ran back to Rob\u2019s uncle\u2019s house, where she joined us under the bed. With no food Claire\u2019s milk dried up within a week. She covered Frederick\u2019s mouth with her hand, so the soldiers on the street could not hear him cry. Even once the fire fights died down, no one would let the children out\u200a\u2014\u200abecause all the adults knew. They knew people were all the same. They knew that we were scared and hungry, thus capable of becoming depraved. The Congolese Army was filled with war orphans (Kadogo), many close to my age, just 11 or 12 years old, children just like me but who hadn\u2019t been forced to stay inside, so they\u2019d wandered out and met a man with a rifle who offered them candy or stew. When the guns quieted during the day we could hear the birds singing. I stopped praying in the scripted Catholic way my mother had taught me. I just spoke to God directly: You say you\u2019re in control and love us so much. Why are you not protecting everyone? We never made it to Rwanda\u200a\u2014\u200astill too unsafe. Instead we lived for a while in Zambia, where Claire worked her magic and got us all asylum in the United States through the International Organization for Migration, a refugee resettlement program. This was great, in theory. We\u2019d have a country again and be able to start building a stable life. We left Africa in August 2000. I cried the entire flight to Chicago. No one would find us now. I didn\u2019t talk about my past. I didn\u2019t want to be that refugee girl, I didn\u2019t want to open that box. When I was in eighth grade, my class took a trip to Washington, D.C. Our first day there we visited the battle field at Antietam. I learned that 23,000 people had died there in a single day. Twenty-three thousand people. In one day. I broke down. The next day we visited the Holocaust Memorial Museum, where a docent handed me an identity card. It had a picture of a bald German man with round glasses\u200a\u2014\u200aJacob Unger, a salesman who died in the Sobibor extermination camp. He had two children and taught Hebrew in the evenings. My whole defensive shell cracked. Nobody in my family talked about all the people we knew who had been killed. I couldn\u2019t hold it all inside anymore. At the Vietnam Memorial, I sat down and sobbed. I felt ashamed of being a human. I felt mad at everything and everyone. I\u2019d thought I was the only one carrying this around and now\u2026 all those names. In 2011, I was invited to speak at a gala honoring Elie Wiesel at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. I was then a junior in college. Mrs. Thomas\u2019s friend wasn\u2019t around to take me shopping, so I ordered a $100 dress online\u200a\u2014\u200ared, with a shell top and a flounce at the waist. It fit horribly but I didn\u2019t have time or money to buy another. I put on a black belt and declared myself good to go. The event filled with survivors and children of survivors, along with dozens of top fundraisers, all of whom made it their duty to remember and make the world remember, too. I was finally starting to realize what I meant to people, how my personal history could make me as relevant and powerful as any donor in the room. I still often feel like the seven-year-old girl, waiting for water at the refugee camp in Burundi, trying to assert that I have a right to take up space. I scan every room for the exits, in case I need to run, and I read people\u2019s faces and body language so I know how they\u2019d like me to walk, talk, and gesture, what they\u2019d like me to do. I know I am ridiculously privileged. I now have so much, and I used to be considered worthless, and nothing about who I am changed. I try to be grateful, proactive, and normal. I live in San Francisco. I go to therapy and yoga. I post filtered pictures on Instagram, hoping that the images will inspire someone, maybe even get someone to see that there\u2019s some refugee girl in Syria, right now, who is exactly like me. I can\u2019t stand to be in one place too long, so I travel a lot. I think the only hope for the world is for each of us to become a better, more self-aware, more responsible person. To inch us toward the goal, I talk about my life. \u201cI was born in Rwanda 27 years ago. I was raised in nine different countries, eight of them in eastern and southern Africa. The ninth, and my current home, is the United States of America. No, my parents were not diplomats\u200a\u2014\u200afar from it\u2026.\u201d People listen, and they don\u2019t listen. They\u2019re amazed and moved, and they look bored and proud of themselves, like they\u2019re checking a box. I try to be relevant and not frightening. I totally freaked out watching The Hunger Games movie. Maybe you did, too? Some people pity me, and want to help me, and can\u2019t stand the idea that I am not defeated and could help them as well. Others cast me as a martyr and a saint: You must be so strong, so brave. You must have learned so much. A few ask if I feel guilty for surviving. Uh, no. I did everything I could to survive. Do you think I should feel guilty for surviving? Do you feel guilty that on 9/11 you weren\u2019t in one of the Twin Towers? I stand there and talk and ask people to investigate their lives and hope they stay awake. When people ask me what to do to ease human suffering, I don\u2019t have a big answer. I just say, \u201cLook, you have this one life. If you keep being selfish and unkind, it\u2019s going to come back to you. Ask yourself why you\u2019re scared, why you hate.\u201d Almost every January, Claire flies back to Rwanda. She buys rice, beef, and potatoes, to throw a big New Year\u2019s party for orphans. Then she puts on a fabulous dress, borrows my aunt\u2019s most expensive bag, and makes me or my uncle, whomever is nearby, take hundreds of pictures of her. Back home, looking at the images, Claire\u2019s daughter always asks, incredulous, \u201cHow could you possibly do that?\u201d Claire just shakes her head and laughs. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?

Folks describe how they lay in bed for hours, their minds churning with worried thoughts and ideas\u200a\u2014\u200aeverything from tomorrow\u2019s grocery list items to work dilemmas and existential anxieties. At the risk of stating the obvious, all these bedtime thoughts and worries are problematic because they keep our minds alert and unable to fall asleep. And while there\u2019s no dearth of advice about getting better sleep, most folks have \u201ctried it all\u201d when it comes to racing thoughts in bed and still can\u2019t seem to shut them off. Whether it\u2019s blackout shades, blue light restrictions or melatonin and Chamomile tea, all those sleep hygiene tips and herbal remedies never really seem to help in the long run. And let\u2019s not forget the big guns: More potent pharmaceuticals like Ambien or Xanax may successfully knock you out (often with some pretty gnarly side effects) but they never address the underlying causes of a racing mind at bed. The reason none of these strategies work very well in the long-term is that they don\u2019t address the actual causes of an overactive mind at bedtime, which typically boils down to two things: Just like Pavlov\u2019s dogs, our minds have been conditioned to think and worry when we get into bed. Unfortunately, we\u2019re the ones who have done the conditioning, and the de-conditioning process is counterintuitive. Recall from Psych 101 that Pavlov\u2019s big breakthrough came when he was studying dog saliva. It just happened that the dogs\u2019 kennels were set up in such a way that every time someone entered with food, a little bell would ring (like the bell that rings when you walk into a small store). While the food itself caused the dogs to get excited and start to salivate, because that food got paired repeatedly with the sound of a bell, over time the dogs learned that bell also meant food was coming. Eventually, just the sound of the bell alone was enough to cue or trigger the dogs\u2019 salivary response. This is called Classical Conditioning. It\u2019s the process by which almost any animal (including humans) can unconsciously learn to associate two unrelated things. \ud83e\udd53 \u27a1\ufe0f \ud83e\udd24 \ud83e\udd53 + \ud83d\udd14 \u27a1\ufe0f \ud83e\udd24 \ud83e\udd53 + \ud83d\udd14 \u27a1\ufe0f \ud83e\udd24 \ud83e\udd53 + \ud83d\udd14 \u27a1\ufe0f \ud83e\udd24 \u2026 \ud83d\udd14 \u27a1\ufe0f \ud83e\udd24 Most people who have trouble falling asleep quickly have unintentionally taught their brains to associate their bed with worry and thinking (I.e. being awake). If we repeatedly get into bed and then do some sort of mentally stimulating activity like having an emotionally-charged conversation with our spouse or checking a bunch of work emails, our beds become a cue or trigger for mental arousal (i.e the brain\u2019s work mode). Which means that in the future, even if we don\u2019t get into a conversation or check our phones, our brain is still going to go into work mode as soon as we get into bed. And if there\u2019s nothing for it to actually work on, it\u2019s going to do fake work (aka worry). \ud83e\udd14 \u27a1\ufe0f \ud83d\ude33 \ud83e\udd14 + \ud83d\udecf \u27a1\ufe0f \ud83d\ude33 \ud83e\udd14 + \ud83d\udecf \u27a1\ufe0f \ud83d\ude33 \ud83e\udd14 + \ud83d\udecf \u27a1\ufe0f \ud83d\ude33 \u2026 \ud83d\udecf \u27a1\ufe0f \ud83d\ude33 The best way out of this cycle is to re-train our brain to worry somewhere else and allow the association between bed and work mode to extinguish. To shift my metaphor a bit, if you want your dog to stop pooping on the grass, you have to train it to poop somewhere else. As we\u2019ll see soon, Deliberate Worry is a technique for teaching our brain to worry somewhere else so that the association between our bed and worry weakens and eventually extinguishes. The second reason our minds worry in bed is because they don\u2019t trust us to remember and take care of important things. Like rehearsing a phone number over and over again to yourself because there\u2019s no where to jot it down, the mind resorts to a very primitive (but powerful) memory strategy for helping us remember important things when we don\u2019t have a better strategy. By continuously throwing problems and worries at us, our mind thinks it\u2019s doing us a favor by ensuring that we don\u2019t forget about these crucial concerns. Of course, the unpleasant side effect is that our mind stays alert and in work mode rather than relaxing and quickly drifting into sleep mode. As David Allen, the author of Getting Things Done, has said: If we want to stop using our brains as a system of reminders and alarms, we need to create another external system that our minds will trust. Only then will our brains be able to relax in bed and quickly shut down for sleep. Luckily, the technique we\u2019re about to discuss, Deliberate Worry, does just that. Over the last several decades, behavioral scientists and psychologists have developed a small collection of powerful techniques for training the brain to calm down at night and fall asleep easily, collectively known as stimulus control. The idea is that if we can control or limit the quality and quantity of stimuli our brains are exposed to at night, it will be much easier for them to remain relaxed and able to fall asleep. In my own clinical practice working with people with insomnia, I\u2019ve combined two of these stimulus control techniques (Scheduled Worry and Constructive Worry) into one strategy called Deliberate Worry. By choosing a specific time and place each day to deliberately worry about difficult things, you\u2019re telling you\u2019re brain: Look little buddy, we\u2019ve got this. There\u2019s a reliable, consistent plan for keeping track of and dealing with all these concerning things. And it happens every day at 4:50pm. So you don\u2019t need to keep reminding me of this stuff every night when I get into bed. With enough training, our brains will learn. I\u2019ve condensed a plan for implementing a Deliberate Worry practice into 5 easy-to-follow steps which are described below. Pick a time slot that you can be consistent with each day of the week (or at least each weekday). It doesn\u2019t have to be a huge amount of time\u200a\u2014\u200ausually somewhere between 5 and 15 minutes is sufficient. Although the first few times you do it may take a bit longer. If possible, piggyback your Deliberate Worry time onto some other consistent activity to help you remember to do it. I do it each day around 4:50pm. Shutting off my computer before leaving my office is a cue to do my Deliberate Worry. Another example might be after you\u2019ve put the kids to bed but before your start watching Netflix or reading. Most people tend to find the early evening\u200a\u2014\u200aafter dinner but before settling in to read or watch TV before bed\u200a\u2014\u200ato be the best time. Just don\u2019t do it immediately before bed, since you should give your mind a little bit of time to unwind afterward. Note: Deliberate Worry should be done consistently in order to get the desired effect. Does that mean you have to do it every day for the rest of your life? Of course not. But if you\u2019ve having trouble falling asleep, commit to at least a couple weeks of doing it every day (at the same time and in the same location) to see a positive effect. Once or twice here and there is not enough. Remember: You\u2019re training your brain; consistency is key. Traditionally known as Scheduled Worry, the first part of Deliberate Worry is what a client of mine affectionately named The Brain Barf. It goes like this: Simply list everything you can think of that is concerning or worrisome. Nothing is too big or too small, from your grocery list to nuclear holocasust. The trick is to go fast. Don\u2019t worry about spelling or completely elaborating on every idea. Just list as many worries as you can as quickly as you can. Be specific but not comprehensive. It\u2019s a little like those annoying free-writing exercises from high school English class where you had to write continuously about whatever came to mind, ostensibly to get your creative juices flowing. The Brain Barf is similar but you want to list as many of your worries and concerns as possible so that your brain learns A) There\u2019s a time and place for worrying and it\u2019s not your bed, and B) You have a trusted system for recording concerning problems. Important: You must write your worries down, ideally by hand, in a notebook that serves only this purpose. Don\u2019t simply run through your worries in your head. Remember, we\u2019re trying to convince our brains that we will remember and keep track of our worries. Once you\u2019ve completed The Brain Barf, look over your list and highlight, circle, or somehow mark the ones that are actionable problems as opposed to hypothetical worries. Much of your Brain Barf may be composed of hypothetical worries such as: But some of what surfaces may be actionable problems rather than worries. To identify these actionable problems, single out items that are A) actual problems (not hypothetical worries), B) urgent (they should be done in the next day or two), and C) things you have direct control over. Here are some examples of actionable problems that might show up amid other worries in your Brain Barf: For each of your Actionable Problems that you singled out from your Brain Barf, write down the next smallest action you could take in order to complete or otherwise work on the problem. Here are the Actionable Problems from above followed by a Next Smallest Action: Important: Notice how specific and concrete these Next Smallest Action are\u200a\u2014\u200asometimes painfully specific! In particular, try to always have a specific time and place associated with your Next Smallest Action. Note: While your Brain Barf items may take the form of nouns (\u201cEmail about TPS reports\u201d), your Next Smallest Actions should always take the form of verbs (\u201cGather notes\u2026\u201d) The final step in Deliberate Worry is to hook your Next Smallest Actions into your task manager/reminder system of choice. If you use a full-featured task management app like OmniFocus or Things, great\u200a\u2014\u200ajust plug it in. More of an old-school, analog Getting Things Done kind of person? No problem, just enter them into your in-box of choice. No idea what I\u2019m talking about with all this stuff? Just ask Siri to remind you to do it at a specific time. At this point, the process of Deliberate Worry may seem like a lot and you may be feeling a little overwhelmed. That\u2019s normal. But it\u2019s really not overly complicated or time-consuming once you get started and make it a routine. Most days, the whole process takes me at most 10 minutes, but usually closer to 3\u20135. Although in the initial week or two, expect to spend at least 10\u201315 minutes doing it. Many of us struggle to calm our racing minds before bed, often laying in bed for what seems like an eternity worrying and not falling asleep. There are two root cause of excessive worry in bed: 1) Classical Conditioning, in which we train our minds to associate our beds with worry, and 2) Trust Issues, meaning our minds don\u2019t trust us to remember important things so they keep throwing worries at us as a primitive way of helping us remember. The solution to both of these root causes of sleep worry and difficulty falling asleep is a technique I call Deliberate Worry, which involves training our minds to worry at a specific time and place outside of bed and building a reliable system for processing legitimate concerns so our mind doesn\u2019t have to constantly remind us of them. Deliberate Worry has 5 Steps: I\u2019ll wrap up by saying that Deliberate Worry is essentially a practice for setting effective boundaries for our problem-solving mind. By cultivating an attractive alternative to worrying in bed, we free up our mind to do what it naturally wants to do in bed at the end of a long day: Simply fall asleep. Acknowledgments: My own ideas for and implementation of Deliberate Worry have been very much influenced by work on Scheduled and Constructive Worry by Drs. Colleen Carney and Rachel Manburn, as well as the productivity/organizational work of David Allen, especially his book Getting Things Done. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

Any number of suggestions have been made, and some high concept attempts have ultimately failed in their deployment. The MeshBox Foundation is seeking to leverage a combination of their MeshBox technology and the upcoming release of the MESH token to introduce connectivity to those remote locations. Previous attempts by tech giants like Facebook and Google have ultimately failed due to over-engineering. Satellite and drone based WiFi may yet become the norm, but in the short term, developing nations need a measure that can be deployed quickly and effectively. The most logical solution is developing a robust mesh networking system that allows a local community to access many of the features of the Internet through their own internal network. Any number of computers, tablets or smart devices can link into the mesh network and access local websites, media and file storage. If any one device is connected to the Internet, the others can use the mesh network to access this connection as well. Even if the mesh network is severed from the Internet at large, the networking function is still fully usable. The Technology behind Mesh Networking The MeshBox device acts as a mesh networking hub directly out of the box. Rather than the inherent difficulties of creating a network between disparate devices, they can connect directly to the MeshBox and immediately have access to the mesh network therein. Multiple MeshBox devices can be linked together to create a larger geographical area, as well as a larger storage base for media and file sharing. Within the MeshBox network, devices will access local pages and media through the SmartMesh protocol at a lightning fast rate\u200a\u2014\u200aeven in areas where internet connectivity is poor or non-existent. In locations where there may only be a single internet connection at a central location, an installed MeshBox can share that connection with any other device on the SmartMesh network. How the MeshBox System can be Deployed in Remote Locations Lacks of internet and electrical infrastructure have both been taken into account during development of the MeshBox. A single device is able to run off of solar power, and can project their signal up to 2km with that electrical supply. A series of these self-sufficient devices can link entire remote and undeveloped villages or towns into a community-wide intranet. From there, local governments can provide quick access to critical information; enterprising individuals can create media or music marketplaces and even establish a local e-commerce system. This level of connectivity can have an immense impact on developing nations. Investing in a single point of access to the Internet could link their entire village into the global network and provide a near limitless supply of information. This information\u200a\u2014\u200aanything from plans for critical equipment to weather and atmospheric data\u200a\u2014\u200acan be stored locally on the mesh network for rapid access by anyone in the area. How the MeshBox can Lighten Server Loads in Developed Areas Even the First World can benefit from the mesh networking provided by MeshBox. Large events that have attracted far beyond the usual amount of network traffic can plan in advance to distribute an appropriate amount of the devices around the venue. With enough capacity, the mesh network can allow attendees to easily access event information without routing directly through to an Internet site. As a direct result, traffic through local cell networks and wireless routers will decrease exponentially and should no longer slow to a crawl. If the event planners wish, they can also connect the mesh network to the Internet, and use the internal SmartMesh protocol to distribute traffic and lighten the server load. This way, individual users uploading to social media will not bog down the local networks and everyone will continue to have access through the course of the event. Integration of the MESH Token Within the SmartMesh protocol, the MESH blockchain token can be used to fund certain actions\u200a\u2014\u200aand can be earned for facilitating them. Users wishing to store files and media on the local mesh network can do so by spending a certain amount of their MESH token supply. They can then charge others for accessing that media, or provide it freely if they wish. MeshBox devices that are connected to the Internet can charge for access to that connection, helping to create an internal community e-commerce market. Once the MESH token is established as having monetary value, it can then be used as a form of digital currency for real world goods. Purchases can be made through the mesh network and MESH tokens can be traded back and forth in areas where electronic banking is completely unknown. Ultimately, the MeshBox Foundation may have found the solution to the world\u2019s connectivity issues\u200a\u2014\u200ain a cost effective, scalable and easily implemented SmartMesh protocol network.

This is 100% my personal opinion, too. So, if you disagree, you are certainly entitled to that. A pet peeve of mine is reading through a great article/story, getting to the bottom, reading through great comments, and not seeing a response from the writer. I understand that articles can get a lot of attention and that can make it tough for a writer to view and respond to every comment. I\u2019m not saying that every writer should respond to every comment. Some comments are only a few words commending the article. Sure, a few claps for the comment would suffice. But, I also see some people comment with amazing thought that actually piggy-backs off the point of the article and can add another element that the writer hadn\u2019t thought of in the first place. This type of comment should really warrant a response. It is bothersome to me when a reader responds as such, and the writer never ever addresses the comment. What are we doing on this platform? I view Medium as a social media outlet for readers and writers. One of my favorite things about writing is the potential for the back-and-forth between the reader and writer. I love struggling through the text, or getting called out randomly because I hadn\u2019t clarified something well enough for the reader. I love seeing readers apply a different type of perspective in the comments\u200a\u2014\u200aone that I hadn\u2019t even considered while I was writing. This is how we grow as writers and readers, people. A writer\u2019s ability to articulate their point\u200a\u2014\u200aa reader\u2019s ability to comprehend a point and respond with their own interpretation. It\u2019s beautiful. Any writer out there reading, I challenge you to hit the comment box more often, if you don\u2019t already. Respond to your readers. No, don\u2019t just respond to the ones that compliment you or make you smile. Respond to the hard comments. The ones that make you question your own point and force you to think outside the box that you created around your piece. I love when readers stretch my capacity. There are people out there that are a lot smarter than me, who probably have forgotten more pieces of insight than I could ever give. I promise you, these people are in your comment boxes. Respond to them, or you might simply just stay the same. Maybe you\u2019re a great writer, and that\u2019s okay for you. It\u2019s just not alright for me. I don\u2019t like leaving criticisms or comments to just sit there with a blank page beneath them. They deserve my attention, just like the attention that they\u2019ve given my article/story. As a writer, it\u2019s so important not to feel all self-righteous and proud about your writing, all the time. Stay humble and respond to the people that are clapping for your piece. If for no other reason than common courtesy. I promise you, if you engage your readers, you will grow, learn, and expand your thought process around the original article idea. If we\u2019re not having conversations here, then what are we doing? This is such a great opportunity to \u201ctell your story\u201d and allow other people to tell theirs through the avenue of their comments. I\u2019m amazed and humbled at what some of the readers have learned from my articles, and also what they\u2019ve taught me through their comments. Honestly, if you\u2019re a writer that doesn\u2019t typically respond\u200a\u2014\u200atry it. Engage with the people that allow you to continue doing what you love.

At the time, he explained to me that BuzzFeed, a company he had built to seed viral content, had become astonishingly popular in its own right, which didn\u2019t surprise me in the slightest, because virtually everything that Jonah Peretti touches seems to become contagiously popular. Jonah had made a healthy amount of money from the Huffington Post sale\u200a\u2014\u200ahe was a co-founder, after all. But he wasn\u2019t yet a media mogul in his own right. Now, in 2014, he is. BuzzFeed, Jonah\u2019s erstwhile viral experiment, has become a white-hot property which is almost certainly worth more than the $315 million AOL paid for the Huffington Post. (While the Huffington Post had just $30 million of revenue when it sold, BuzzFeed is expecting to bring in four times that amount in 2014.) Jonah is not your typical media mogul, however. He\u2019s smarter than most, and more accessible, and also much happier than many to share his thoughts. Which is why I asked Jonah if he\u2019d be interested in talking to me over an extended period. To my delight, he said yes, and we ended up having four interviews spanning more than six hours. The resulting Q&A is long, for which I make no apologies. You\u2019ll learn a lot about Jonah Peretti and how he thinks\u200a\u2014\u200abut you\u2019ll also learn a great deal about the modern media world, the way the Internet has evolved, and the way that Jonah has evolved with it. If you want to learn the secret of how Jonah managed to build two of the world\u2019s most important online media properties, you\u2019ll find that here, too. Which brings me to another way in which Jonah differs from most other moguls. If you succeed in building something similarly successful as a result, he will be cheering you all the way. \u201cI think The New York Times does a lot of tremendous journalism. It\u2019s just sometimes, the stories are boring.\u201d Jump \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201dJump \u201cThere\u2019s sometimes moments where networks are so amenable to spread.\u201d Jump \u201cThe thing is, if you care about having an impact on the world, the too-early mode is the highest leverage point.\u201d Jump \u201cWhat Ken Lerer said to me was,\u2018I know business, you know the Internet, let\u2019s build something together. Let\u2019s start something.\u2019\u201d Jump \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy raising money for BuzzFeed. It was always, is there any way you can do this without having any writers or content creators or journalists?\u201d Jump \u201cWhat would this be if the readers and the publishers were not focused on making something similar to print?\u201d Jump \u201cLife is tricky because it happens once and there\u2019s no opportunity for A/B testing.\u201d Jump Back to Top Felix: Let\u2019s talk about the only subject of conversation among media types for the past couple of weeks. Jonah: NBA playoffs. FS: You guys had a little scoop there with The New York Times Innovation Report. JP: Yeah, we did. FS: Did you read it? I thought it was pretty good, pretty smart, intelligent stuff. JP: I did read it. There were a lot of interesting things in it. I think in some places, they were a little bit overly critical of their tech and product team. When you look around the industry, The New York Times has a really great website. They\u2019re building lots of things themselves and integrating them. It doesn\u2019t feel like a Frankenstein website with things bolted on from millions of other places. I was a little surprised at the tone, how critical they were of their web products. FS: I think so too. JP: And they were a little too nice to some of the competitors they mentioned. They were like, this site has this feature, and this site has that feature. But, a lot of the sites they were mentioning, the Times is actually ahead of on tech and products. And you can find one thing that another site has that you don\u2019t have, but you shouldn\u2019t lacerate yourself for that. Then the other thing was this bedrock assumption that The New York Times\u2019s content is just the best content. I think that they do a lot of tremendous journalism. They have a lot of great stuff. It\u2019s just sometimes, the stories are boring, or, by certain metrics of excellence, they\u2019re not excellent content. The report was a little too harsh on their tech and product team, and not critical enough on their editorial team. I was a little bit surprised that the report didn\u2019t spend much time tackling the hardest issue, which is why do they need to have so much revenue? It\u2019s because their cost structure is made for print. When you look at how much revenue comes from print and the scale of their operation because of print, the challenge that they\u2019re facing moving forward is how do they move into a post-print world. FS: A post-print world, by its nature, is a lower revenue world than a print world. JP: It might not be eventually, but it is right now, and how do you switch over? That seems to be the actual tricky issue. It just seems like if you\u2019re reading a secret internal report for The New York Times, the things that people would be stressed about, isn\u2019t that, oh, the website\u2019s not good enough, or they haven\u2019t moved fast enough with this feature or that feature, but more like how do we deal with this very different cost structure of our future business, compared to our past business. FS: There\u2019s real value to print, still. And covers. There\u2019s an amazing value to the New York Post front page. There\u2019s amazing value to the front cover of The Economist. There\u2019s an amazing value to the front cover of Vogue. And it seems to be that all of that value has either disappeared or is disappearing in the digital world, or else it\u2019s being captured by the platforms rather than the publications. JP: There\u2019s something about covers. For a while we were making covers. If a story was big or important, I\u2019d make a cover. Maybe the fact that you only have one cover each week means that you\u2019re taking the force of an entire brand and making one big bet. Every week. Or every month. FS: If you had something you wanted to change in the world, how much marginal extra impact could you have by that act of pushing it? Do you have the equivalent of a front page or cover on BuzzFeed? JP: With gay rights and Sochi, we pushed really hard along with a few other groups, and it resulted in statements by Russian authorities and Obama. Six months before the Olympic games we were pushing on this. It was a combination of what we call Buzz Team stuff, you know, the lists and quizzes and entertaining stuff, and it was reporting and scoops and more classically journalistic work. The combination of those things did draw a lot of attention early on. But it\u2019s not like one cover and one story. FS: It shouldn\u2019t be. This is the great advantage of digital. Things don\u2019t end once they\u2019ve gone to print. JP: We see with our longform stories that, in some cases, the sheer length and rigor of a piece will make the piece have a bigger impact. Just the fact that it\u2019s 6,000 words or 12,000 words. FS: Can I just say, for the record, that your piece about gays in figure skating was way too long? JP: Was that one too long? Well, they shouldn\u2019t be long for the sake of being long. I didn\u2019t read that one. FS: No one read that one. They got about a third of the way through and then they\u2019re like, \u201cOh my god, there\u2019s like 8,000 more words. I just can\u2019t bear it.\u201d Back to Top Jonah: What are we doing here? Felix: What are we doing here? That\u2019s a good question. What we\u2019re doing here is something that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever done before, which is a longform Q&A. JP: This will be longer than that figure skating article, and even more boring. FS: But you know what? It\u2019s got a rhythm to it, which makes it so much easier to read a long Q&A, if it\u2019s well edited. JP: It\u2019s like a list. FS: It\u2019s a little bit like a list. It\u2019s a list of questions. I guess you can skip. But you never do, though. When you\u2019re reading those things, you don\u2019t skip questions, do you? It just makes me feel like I\u2019m making progress. So, let\u2019s get to it. You have been, over the course of your career, pretty astonishingly successful at capturing these moods of the Internet, for lack of a better word, and knowing what\u2019s going to work, or seemingly knowing what\u2019s going to work, or at least being able to find out what\u2019s going to work and doing it. And you\u2019ve done that in a bunch of different areas, in a bunch of different companies. I guess that one of the things I want to do is go back to the beginning and some of the earlier stuff you did, and say, back when you forwarded an email from Nike to a few friends of yours or whatever, was that all part of some grand career plan you had going on? JP: Every step is just perfectly planned out. FS: It\u2019s so easy to create a narrative with hindsight, to put this beautiful narrative career progression onwards and upwards. JP: One theory about early successes is that they often are fairly random. So there\u2019s lots of smart people, there\u2019s lots of pretty talented people and then, in some cases, they end up being a talented computer science grad at Stanford. Some of them go on to be professors and teach or work at good startups\u2014and then Larry and Sergey are running this giant empire. Part of that is chance, or luck, or happenstance, the initial project being right for the moment and taking off and getting attention and it snowballs from there. There\u2019s some theory that a lot of this is the result of preferential attachment or cumulative advantage. Preferential attachment is a node in a network that you connect to early and then it\u2019s more connected so it\u2019s more likely to attract other connections. The Nike email was this accidental, random thing that resulted in me being able to find Ken and Arianna Huffington to be partners with because I had made this big thing that was big on the Internet. And then because of that it was easier to do BuzzFeed. You have more opportunity when you have an early success, then there\u2019s more opportunity and then that opportunity allows you to do other things and it snowballs. So small, lucky things that happen early on can sometimes have a ripple effect and then people look back on it and say, oh wow, that person is smart or talented or something because it seems like it\u2019s a string of these things, but actually they\u2019re not independent variables. FS: So where would you begin in the story of Jonah Peretti. JP: I probably wouldn\u2019t. FS: This is where you have to talk about yourself. This is the uncomfortable bit. JP: The Nike email was the thing that opened my eyes to the kind of stuff I\u2019m doing now and it really was an accident. It was, \u201cI should be writing my master\u2019s thesis. I\u2019m procrastinating.\u201d FS: You\u2019re where at this point? JP: I\u2019m at the MIT Media Lab and, before that, I was a schoolteacher in New Orleans. I could start back there if you want. I was just in New Orleans this weekend. I saw the guy who gave me my first job, Dale Smith, who was the head of the computer department at Isidore Newman School in New Orleans. He hired me when I was twenty-two years old and I had some teaching experience in summers and some technology experience. I moved to New Orleans and became a schoolteacher. I was twenty-two years old, wearing a tie, being called Mr. Peretti by your students. FS: And you\u2019re teaching them computers? JP: I taught sixth graders how to make websites on GeoCities. I taught sixth graders how to make games like Myst, using Hyperstudio. We\u2019d make a giant map and then everyone in the class would make different rooms and they\u2019d all connect together. I taught Logo programming, things like \u201cdesign a flower that is different every single time because there\u2019s randomness in it, but the petals have to connect.\u201d Teaching things like order and randomness. We did social protest letters, using the Microsoft Office Letter Wizard. These sixth graders would send a letter to Mayor Morial or send a letter to The Limited complaining that the prices were too high and their parents wouldn\u2019t let them buy outfits there. Dale, or Mr. Smith, hired me and then let me just come up with creative lessons and experiment with ideas. Just so long as it involved technology, I could do it. Before there was the Second Life craze\u2014which has now passed\u2014ten years before that there were these virtual worlds, and we used those to do historical role playing between kids in the South and kids in the North. I did all these projects with students and then I would write them up and submit them to educational technology conferences. I ended up going to Calgary or Seattle or Orlando and presenting the work that I was doing with these kids. That was really only possible because Dale was supportive, and the school even paid for me to go on a couple of these trips. It was really fun and actually Peggy Wang, the first editor of BuzzFeed, was my student at Newman and is still here. That is how I was able to get into MIT. I had published these papers and had done all these interesting lessons and there was a professor there who was interested in cognitive science and behavioral psychology and learning, so I joined that group to do educational technology work. And then I got to take classes from Marvin Minsky, the artificial intelligence pioneer, and Seymour Papert, the guy who invented the Logo programming language, and a bunch of people at MIT who were thinking about learning and education. That stuff is relevant to the media business. You\u2019re explaining things and communicating. FS: And being creative. JP: And you have lots of practice communicating. I was trying to teach twelfth graders. In the school handbook, there were three grading scales, one was a hundred-point-scale, and one was a four-point scale and one was a letter grade scale. I noticed that they couldn\u2019t just be converted between each other. Like an F and an A would average to a C, but a hundred and a zero would average to an F, because it would be fifty. So I noticed that there were these weird things and I was like, \u201cOh, that seems like an interesting thing to teach these students, especially because they think about their grades and they want to get good grades and the way that grades are calculated could have an effect on them.\u201d In one system, if you have a lot of A\u2019s you can be like, \u201cI\u2019m not even going to take this exam,\u201d and then in another one, you\u2019re like \u201cOh, I\u2019ve got to go take the exam and get an F.\u201d We had Excel and so I was trying to use Excel to model some of it. It was so hard. The first time I taught it in a class of twenty, maybe five students really got the nuances and could use it in different ways, could understand the idea of these different systems. The next time I taught it, maybe I got half the class to get it. And then I kind of got stuck there. I got maybe 60 percent of the class to understand this. The default is always, and I saw this with all the good teachers, that it\u2019s your fault, not the students\u2019 fault. You should be able to figure out how to teach students something, and if there\u2019s a student who has a learning disability, you should figure out how to route around it and explain it in another way. The worst teachers, in my view, were the teachers who said, \u201cWell, that kid\u2019s just lazy\u201d or \u201cThis kid\u2019s just stupid,\u201d and they would only teach for the 80 percent of students who thought in a normal way. When you think about the media industry, it\u2019s also, \u201cHow do you reach people and how do you get people to understand?\u201d If you write something and nobody understands it, it\u2019s easy to be, like, \u201cOh those are all the dumb people.\u201d Sometimes writing something that\u2019s very sophisticated and difficult and technical for a particular audience is totally fine, but you should be able to communicate in simple language. FS: Just about anything, right? JP: Yeah. The thing is, there are dangers in this, because you can also explain something in a way that makes people feel like they understand it when they actually don\u2019t. FS: Fox News is very good at that. JP: Right. You can figure out a way to frame something and explain it so that it feels like it confirms what people already believe, including incorrect things they believe. You learn a lot from teaching and you learn all about how to communicate. I came out of a university system that was, at that particular moment in the \u201990s, glorifying postmodern critical theory. There was a sense that the best way to show you understand something is to write something incomprehensible. So all of a sudden, sitting in front of a bunch of twelve-year-olds or a bunch of seventeen-year-olds and having to try to explain something to them, it was a good reminder that it\u2019s possible to communicate. FS: Was that you? Were you sitting there, an undergrad, reading French philosophers? JP: I was reading Foucault and Roland Barthes and Kant and Marx and Freud. FS: And also doing the tech stuff. JP: And then also doing 3-D modeling and HTML and JavaScript. I was an environmental studies major, not a CS [Computer Science] major. FS: This was where and when? JP: This was UC Santa Cruz, 1996. I grew up in Oakland, California, on the border with Berkeley. My mom taught at Berkeley, and it was like right there. So I only applied to UC Santa Cruz. My college guidance counselor told me that they don\u2019t even read the essay if your scores are at a certain level. So I was just like, \u201cOkay, that means I can just apply to one school,\u201d and they were like, \u201cYeah you can.\u201d Some friends were like, \u201cyou\u2019re throwing your education away.\u201d There were no grades at UC Santa Cruz. We\u2019re really going deep. If I didn\u2019t know you, I wouldn\u2019t talk to you about any of this stuff. FS: This is what [writer] Jeff Bercovici said about [Gawker Media founder] Nick Denton, as well [during a recent Playboy interview]: \u201cI could do this only because we\u2019ve known each other for years.\u201d JP: There\u2019s something about talking about yourself to someone you know, as opposed to\u2026 Anyway, I just made every class I was in an independent study. I\u2019d go to the professor and be like, \u201cHey, can I do this extra thing, or do that?\u201d As a freshman, I\u2019d go to the upper division classes and say, \u201cHey, can I take this class?\u201d And by sophomore year, I would go take graduate classes. A lot of the best professors were in this History of Consciousness program, which was essentially each professor competing to be the most radical, whether it was French feminism, postmodernism, critical theory, post-colonial studies, Lacanian psychoanalysis. Then, each summer, I worked as a teacher: sometimes as a technology teacher and sometimes just at educational summer programs. Back to Top Felix: From here, you then get this awesome-sounding job in New Orleans. You had that for how long? Jonah: For three years. Then off to MIT where I just wander around with a bunch of nerds and eat tacos and talk about ideas and work on projects and have no real responsibility at all. The Nike thing happened in the end of my time there and was accidental and got me thinking about networks and scale and network science and how do ideas spread and things like that. But most of my time when I was there, I was thinking about teaching and learning and technology. I built a prototype of a Lego robotics thing that, while you\u2019re watching educational television, it beams code to the thing you\u2019re building so then it animates it. These are the kind of things you do there. You\u2019d hack something together in a couple of weeks and you\u2019d get to the point of it being a demo and some of those times you\u2019d just stop there and then do something else. The laboratory for computer science thought that maybe our people were a little bit flaky. FS: Dilettantish? JP: Yeah. They\u2019re working on one algorithm or whatever for like a year, and we would just kind of do projects and demo them. The demo was a huge part of the Media Lab. Sometimes corporate sponsors or just your peers would come by during demo week and you would show them stuff. If you had a cool demo, people would gather round and get interested and want to hear more and want to contribute to it. If you had a lame demo, people would shun you. FS: And then, while you\u2019re doing your master\u2019s, you just decide to troll Nike by email. JP: I wasn\u2019t trying to troll them, I was just trying to check out their service. I was kind of like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s cool.\u201d The idea of product personalization is the kind of idea that could be a media demo. I wanted to see how it worked. It was a little disappointing because you couldn\u2019t really do that much. It was more just change the color or put a name on. And then I think I tried a bad word or something and it was banned. Then I put sweatshop and it wasn\u2019t. Oh, interesting. So I ordered them. I was like, \u201cThey\u2019re going to send me these shoes.\u201d I just thought that was a funny idea. But then that led to this person writing back and I was surprised. I thought, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll get a form letter back.\u201d And it was clear that what they wrote back was part formula, part human. Like a human was editing a form letter. I was like, \u201cOh, there\u2019s someone on the other end of the line.\u201d So I said, \u201cNo, sweatshop is in the dictionary. It\u2019s a shop where factory workers toil under unhealthy conditions.\u201d And then they wrote back again. It was in January of 2001, so there wasn\u2019t YouTube, there wasn\u2019t Facebook, there wasn\u2019t Twitter. There wasn\u2019t a concept of things going viral. It\u2019s funny how that\u2019s become so normalized where people say, \u201cOh, maybe that will go viral.\u201d At that time, nobody ever said, \u201cThis thing could go viral.\u201d That wasn\u2019t part of anyone\u2019s consciousness. There were email forwards, and blogging was an interesting subculture. So it became one of the early email forwards, which you already know, and resulted in reporters calling me to ask about it. I ended up on the Today Show with Katie Couric and Nike\u2019s head of PR, debating something I didn\u2019t even know anything about, thinking, \u201cWhy am I here instead of people who\u2019ve dedicated their lives fighting for human rights?\u201d So to me it seemed like this interesting communications phenomenon. The Media Lab had Lexis Nexis, so I found all these examples of press articles. In all this press, people were saying, \u201cand he just told a few friends and then it went viral.\u201d I found that there were just dozens and dozens and dozens of press articles. You could do a find and replace of the Nike emblem and put some other thing that had been written and it was always like, \u201cThis kid did this little thing and it was just kind of a joke and they were just trying to make a dancing baby for this one thing and then, all of a sudden\u2026\u201d There were dozens and dozens of these. One school was trying to see if they could have an email that would reach all the way across the world to Australia. They sent out an email and said sign this thing and forward it on and try to reach someone in Australia. Their servers were taken down because so many inbound emails came and it crashed. So there are all these examples. From this totally naive perspective, they all said this accidental thing happened, and a cascade through a network emerged, although they didn\u2019t use that language. And then, like, \u201cWow, isn\u2019t this an interesting, weird phenomenon\u201d without really any insight beyond that. Then it turned out there were also all these people studying network science, that I didn\u2019t know about at the time, including this guy Duncan Watts, who\u2019s now BuzzFeed\u2019s science advisor and a good friend of mine. He was working out the mathematics of six degrees of separation as a grad student at Cornell and studying the networks of how a cricket chirp spread. Should I stop? FS: No, keep on going. JP: A cricket would chirp, and then neighboring crickets would chirp, and that sound would cascade. So he was measuring that empirically. [Psychologist] Stanley Milgram, in the 1970s, had coined the phrase six degrees of separation. He had figured out experimentally that you could start with a chain letter in Chicago and reach a stockbroker in Boston and it took on average six steps, but he did it without any mathematical rigor and with all these broken chains, where it would go three hops and go dark. So Duncan essentially looked at that and said, \u201cWell, what if we re-did this experiment? What if we mapped this out?\u201d With his advisor, he created the Watts-Strogatz theorem, which described the conditions that a network needs to have for it to be a small world, where through a few short hops, you can get to any other node in the network. Duncan was studying networks and then he starts looking at the study of human behavior and decisions and behavioral economics and things like that. So I think Duncan went into it at a much deeper level and with much more rigor and much less smoke and mirrors and with many fewer people watching. I think that there\u2019s this natural progression of these two pieces. Usually the order is, \u201cOh, wow, look at this parlor trick. Something just spread to millions of people and everything is connected and things cascade.\u201d And then you say, \u201cOh, how does this work?\u201d Well, there are mathematical properties in networks and that\u2019s interesting to look at. But then there\u2019s each node. In the case of an email forward, the nodes are people or a site, like Black People Love Us or Rejection Line. And then how do people make decisions? How do they decide that of all the things that come into their inbox, they\u2019re going to forward this Nike email, but they\u2019re not going to forward other things? Then you start thinking about human psychology and how people evaluate content. How do people decide whether something is worth passing on to their friend or not? This kind of gets back to education in a way, or trying to understand how the brain or mind works. It was this giant, unfolding, complex problem with different areas that you could spend a whole lifetime thinking about and working on from the structural mathematical sense of networks. All those things working together started to feel like the way the media industry\u2019s going to work. That\u2019s the way content and ideas will spread. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a broadcast pipe or printing press and trucks driving around newspapers. It feels like there\u2019s this new, different way that people are just beginning to understand. Even now, websites look kind of like print publications and we\u2019re still stuck in lots of legacy ways of thinking. But now there\u2019s this possibility of, \u201cOh, it could work a different way.\u201d FS: And all of this just went automatically through your head the minute you saw the Nike email go viral? JP: No. It\u2019s like a constellation of connected things. FS: Okay, so this is one of the very small number of actual, genuine questions I wanted to ask. Obviously the Nike thing was lightning in a bottle\u2014just randomly happened. And then you have Black People Love Us and Rejection Line. JP: Rejection Line and then Black People Love Us. FS: Were there others in there which just didn\u2019t work, or did you have a hundred-percent hit rate? JP: The Nike email, and the next was Rejection Line. That was the only other thing. Then Black People Love Us. I was teaching a class, and it was a design class, so Chelsea [Peretti; Jonah\u2019s sister, currently starring on \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d] and I farmed out ideas to the students and said, \u201cYour job is a design challenge.\u201d We were the clients, basically: \u201cMake these things.\u201d Some of those ideas were things that we came up with because we needed one for every student, and some of the things we were excited about. Black People Love Us is the one where we actually took the pictures, developed the stuff, you know. But there were others in that cohort of students that didn\u2019t do as well. FS: You\u2019re basically just completely taking advantage of these poor design students to further your own nefarious ends? JP: Actually, I stopped teaching the class that way. I subsequently taught the class and said, \u201cYou have to come up with your own ideas.\u201d I did an RFP. Part of the issue was that the students at Parsons [The New School for Design], some of them were pure design people, so they were like, \u201cWhat? Come up with an idea for some viral thing or whatever? I know Photoshop. I know Illustrator.\u201d Maybe that\u2019s changed since then. With this class, we had them do a design challenge of our ideas and then make their own projects. So we said, \u201cLearn by doing one of our projects and then do your own.\u201d FS: But your ideas were better than their ideas. JP: Yeah. There\u2019s all these things you can do to ensure that something doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019m thinking back to what other things were going on at that time. The first one was sort of an accident. The Nike thing was an accident and I collaborated on that one with a customer service representative at Nike\u2014a non-consensual collaboration maybe. The next one with Chelsea was Rejection Line and that was the only one we did and it really took off. And then Black People Love Us was the one we really focused on in terms of these design challenges. I think it\u2019s hard to do that and the only reason we were able to do three in a row is because no one was trying to make things that were viral. There was no competition. There were things accidentally happening that sometimes would go viral, and then we were like one of maybe a few dozen people trying to actually make viral web culture, when nobody was doing it. So the networks were completely open in the sense that no one was even trying to make content that intentionally would go viral. A few years later, everyone is like, \u201cHow do I make my YouTube video go viral and how do I make this and how do I do this viral marketing project?\u201d There\u2019s sometimes moments where networks are so amenable to spread. Duncan uses this forest-fire analogy, which is if there\u2019s a forest where the underbrush is wet, the trees are far apart, there\u2019s not many dead trees, you could take a flamethrower to it and it won\u2019t burn. If the forest is dry and it\u2019s been hot and the trees are close together, you can just drop a match and the whole thing will burn. I think there was a period between 2001 and 2003 when the dry forest was ready to burn. If you made something that was pretty funny and you made something that had certain qualities that caused people to want to share and talk and discuss, then things would spread pretty far. Now you see people do a really cool project or a cool Tumblr and they don\u2019t end up on the Today Show. We were on Good Morning America for Black People Love Us. We had the front page of Sunday Styles for Black People Love Us. The Rejection Line, we were on CNN and in People and in Elle. I think that some project like that today, would not have had the novelty to get the mainstream attention and would have a lot more competition on the web of cool things, and the rate at which they spread has been compressed a lot so things pop for a day or two. The Nike email was three or four months and the Rejection Line was like maybe a month and a half and then Black People Love Us compressed to a little less than a month. So things were spreading faster and the network was more lubricated or more connected, but also there started to be more and more people making things designed for these networks. So it\u2019s kind of like cable existed and there was only three channels on cable and you start a new cable channel and you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, people love my channel.\u201d But it\u2019s really that the cable networks were just built out and Viacom doesn\u2019t exist yet so you succeed by default. FS: It\u2019s interesting that the sign that you got it right, the sign that these things succeeded, is, you can say, \u201cOh, I was on the telly. I was on the front page of the Styles section.\u201d It\u2019s this sort of ratification of digital culture by the mainstream media, which was very important back then. JP: Yeah, for sure. FS: But it still seems that these were basically, for lack of a better word, Media Lab projects? They were still just kind of you messing around on the Internet and seeing what worked or was there actually some kind of commercial kernel? JP: It wasn\u2019t commercial. In fact, often the mainstream media would cover this stuff\u200a\u2014\u200awe were on CNN talking about Rejection Line and they think it\u2019s kind of a cool project and then they\u2019re like, \u201cSo, are you making any money on this?\u201d We were, \u201cOh, no, it\u2019s not a commercial project.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cHa ha ha.\u201d They were laughing. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of time on your hands.\u201d That\u2019s a phrase people would use. \u201cOh, wow, you must have a lot of time on your hands,\u201d and laughing that it doesn\u2019t make any money. For a lot of people, having something make money is the thing that legitimizes it. Maybe mainstream media legitimizes it to a certain point, but mainstream media plus actually making money is, \u201cOh, this is real.\u201d For me, I was just trying to understand how these networks work. And for Chelsea, she was just like, \u201cOh, this is awesome. I have a massive venue for my comedy.\u201d For her, I think she saw it as more of a platform for comedy and for me it was like a lab to understand the way networks work and content spreads and ideas spread. FS: When did you first hear this word viral? This odd epidemiological metaphor that seems to have taken over the world? JP: I\u2019m not sure when I first heard it, but it\u2019s one of those words that started to have a worse and worse brand, if you can think of a word having a brand. Viral marketing companies started to use it to describe a phenomenon that is actually not viral, which is making something and buying a million views for it and then saying, \u201cThis got a million views, it\u2019s viral.\u201d And then they\u2019d say a million views means viral. We were thinking in terms of an actual epidemiological definition of viral, with a certain threshold of contagion that results in it growing through time. Instead of exponential decay, you get exponential growth. That is what viral is. FS: I didn\u2019t know how to react to Black People Love Us. I think I got the joke, but I\u2019m not American, so maybe I didn\u2019t. I certainly got the message, which is, \u201cLet\u2019s laugh at all of these people who are getting offended by this.\u201d JP: Well, right. As trolling, you understood it. FS: Yeah. JP: So, some context. My sister lived at Sojourner Truth House at Barnard College and was one of the few white students who lived there. If you think back to university, like UC Santa Cruz, which was a very progressive university but with mostly white students, there was a phenomenon of liberal, progressive students who were trying to show how not racist they were. I was just thinking about this. I had a friend who had dreadlocks and anywhere she went, white guys would offer her weed. She smoked weed occasionally so it was actually kind of nice. She never had to pay for weed. But it was like, \u201cIt\u2019s so cool. I\u2019m smoking a joint with this cool black girl.\u201d There was this excessive attempt to show that you were progressive and you had black friends, so I think part of the humor of it comes from this sort of late \u201990s or early 2000s progressive university culture that was starting to evolve beyond this naive and performative attempt to prove that you\u2019re not racist through your affiliations with black people. That was at the center of it. The targets of the satire were a particular kind of young, white, liberal person. The reality of these web projects is that they then reach all these other groups. We were continually shocked at how different people were reacting to it. One thing Paul Berry noticed when he was doing his Dog Island project is that there\u2019s always this matrix where you have the four quadrants. One dimension is, \u201cDo people get it or do they not get it?\u201d and then another dimension is, \u201cDo they like it or do they hate it?\u201d FS: You need a certain amount of don\u2019t-get in order for these things to work? JP: Yeah, probably. FS: Were there any white liberals in the not-get half or did they all get it and either hate it or like it? JP: That\u2019s the other thing. You could put every email we got into this matrix, too, and then we\u2019re the ones who don\u2019t get it or get it. We\u2019d get emails from someone saying, \u201cOh, yeah, I love the site and I have a lot of black friends.\u201d Are they playing along, or are they liberal and they\u2019ll get it, or are they just clueless? FS: This reminds me a bit of, I guess from the same era, was what you might call early snark era Dave Eggers before he renounced such childish stuff and became a post-ironic do-gooder. JP: What if that whole debate is really just about life stage? It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, no no no, snark and trolling and being relentlessly critical is good when you\u2019re younger\u2026\u201d FS: But this is super-high irony, right? That\u2019s something which feels like early 2000s in a way. You don\u2019t have that mode so much any more. JP: It\u2019s harder to pull off too because there are so many ways of validating things. People are so good at saying, \u201cOh, let me do a Google search. Let me see where else this has appeared. Who\u2019s shared this on Facebook? Has BuzzFeed written about it? Has The New York Times written about it?\u201d FS: It\u2019s also a little bit cruel, deliberately cruel. I mean it\u2019s a worthy target. JP: This is also post hoc. With hindsight, if you think that Chelsea and I would be doing this today, it would be more cruel. But at the time we were doing it, Chelsea was a little nervous about making sure that the humor was right and that it would communicate what we wanted to communicate and not actually have the opposite effect that we wanted. FS: You wanted to find people all over the quadrants? JP: We didn\u2019t know these quadrants existed then. The effect we wanted was to, at least in my mind, satirize shallow liberals and their relationships with people of color that they were using for their own vanity instead of something real. So it was like a critique of a particular type of college liberalism that had gotten out of control. The idea was that it would satirize those people and maybe annoy them a little and then for more enlightened people, it would be a funny joke and they would get that it was a satire of those people. But it was made for this smaller group and it blew up in a much bigger way than we anticipated. We thought it would go viral within one group, and we saw it start jumping from different groups. It would be on hair-care message boards but also a car message board, where people are talking about different kinds of cars and then people are on there debating it and white power groups. The thing that was pretty eye-opening to me, just from a technology standpoint or from a network standpoint, was that you could look at your referral stats and you could see traffic coming from these different places. Back to Top Felix: You have this charming narrative. \u201cI was teaching in New Orleans and I went to the MIT Media Lab, and then I was living in New York.\u201d Jonah: And none of it\u2019s true. I know you won\u2019t do any fact-checking because it\u2019s too much work. FS: Oh god, can you imagine. JP: No record of him ever living in New Orleans. FS: Probably, if this was a Playboy thing, they would do that. JP: Medium\u2019s fact-checking team is\u2014they might actually have fact-checkers at Medium. I wouldn\u2019t be shocked. [Ed note: We do. Don\u2019t be shocked.] FS: Tell me a little bit about what\u2019s going through your head, and how you\u2019re making a living, when you were in Boston and when you were in New York before HuffPo and full-on media life. JP: In Boston, I had saved a little bit of money from teaching. I made $24,000 a year in the first year, which in 1996-97 in New Orleans was amazing. I had a shotgun apartment, I could go out to eat whenever I wanted. It was my first job and it was awesome. It took maybe twelve years to get to the point where I had an apartment as nice as I had in New Orleans. Then the MIT Media Lab gives a scholarship to every student, so you\u2019re essentially a paid researcher. I could live like a grad student and break even. I think I spent $1,000 from savings or $1,500 from savings in the two years I was there. So that was awesome. And then I got hired to be the director of R&D at this urban technology non-profit in New York, called Eyebeam. FS: Eyebeam, of course, yes. JP: So I worked at Eyebeam and the Nike email had taken off and the Rejection Line was just sort of between Boston and New York. We hadn\u2019t, I think, launched it yet until we were in New York. Then at Eyebeam I was able to have my work be these projects, so Black People Love Us and Rejection Line were done at Eyebeam. Then there was Fundraise, which was another thing that was the first geo-coded campaign-contribution database that allowed you to type in your building and see who gave in your building. FS: I remember that. JP: That also was a very viral thing that I did with this guy, Mike Frumin, at Eyebeam. By the second week people in Milwaukee were like, \u201cThe Brewers gave to Bush and this is how much.\u201d That was all work I could do at Eyebeam because Eyebeam was created by John Johnson and he was from the Johnson & Johnson family and he had been a filmmaker, an artist, and a patron of the arts, and he built Eyebeam as this creative space where artists and hackers and engineers and activists could come together and do projects. I ended up building the Artist In Residency program there and then starting something called the Eyebeam Open Lab, which had a free printer and a laser cutter and electronic soldering benches and did residency programs for a year, renewable for a second year. I wrote a grant to the MacArthur Foundation and they funded the Open Lab. The concept was R&D for the public domain. Instead of a private research thing where you figure something out and then the IP is owned by the university or by a corporation, we would make things and then publicly license them, whether it\u2019s through an open source license or Creative Commons or just DIY instructions for hardware. So the MacArthur Foundation was like, \u201cOh that\u2019s cool. If we fund that, then other organizations can use the work and it can have a bigger impact.\u201d And then I would do these creative technology groups and contagious media groups in the evenings. I would order from Giovanni\u2019s Pizza in Chelsea and it was usually groups of six to eight people and we would brainstorm ideas, talk about projects, build projects, show each other projects. Josh Schachter was building Delicious, and all he ever talked about at these meetings was Delicious. And we did Fundraise. We did Re-blog, which was this server-side RSS reader that let you read your RSS feeds from any computer. And then we had this little Re-blog button and if you clicked it it would push the post onto your blog or onto a public-facing blog and it would say, \u201cFrom: kottke.org re-blogged by Felix Salmon.\u201d And if someone was reading that, they could do it and it would show the chain of attribution. We built that because Eyebeam couldn\u2019t afford to have a full-time blogger writing about stuff happening at Eyebeam, so we\u2019d have a guest re-blogger and they would come in and they would have a feed and they would just re-blog the stuff they liked. That was the first instance of that particular form of sharing. We had several people come to us and say, \u201cThis should be a company. Dude, turn this into a thing.\u201d I think we were just like, \u201cOh, we\u2019re not really interested in starting a company\u201d and \u201cThat sounds terrible that we\u2019d have to maintain all these servers and host this,\u201d and like, \u201cThe idea is already out there and that\u2019s what it\u2019s about.\u201d FS: This was all too early, wasn\u2019t it? I mean Dodgeball was too early. In a way, Blogger was too early. And then Tumblr just sort of hit at the right time. JP: Tumblr was starting a little bit after that, or maybe even overlapping, but Tumblr didn\u2019t have re-blog. FS: Oh really? When Tumblr launched? JP: Yeah, it didn\u2019t have re-blog when it launched. FS: I thought that was there from the beginning. JP: No, it was based on tumble logging, which was this convention that some people were doing that [Tumblr founder] David Karp saw. It was short snips of text and images and pieces and that would be your tumble log, but it wasn\u2019t social. So he kind of took the re-blog idea and the tumble log idea and an amazing design and incredible focus and turned that into something that was sort of between the two of them, sort of a social network or sharing thing. But there were so many things like that in that era where people were building these little half-baked things. Like [Computer scientist] Jeff Hahn was making multi-touch displays and he would come to the technology group things, and he was working on these cool hacks, and then, all of a sudden, they\u2019re on CNN and soon after that they\u2019re in everyone\u2019s pocket in the entire universe. I don\u2019t know whether Jeff Hahn licensed technology that ended up in the iPhone or CNN thing. I think that he was doing the CNN one for them, but he was mostly too early. The thing is, if you care about having an impact on the world, the too-early mode is the highest leverage point because you can have an idea, build a mock or a prototype of it, and then have those ideas find themselves in products that other people build that then scale up to massive. FS: You\u2019d rather be Xerox than Apple? JP: People always talk about Xerox as a sad story. FS: Maybe. JP: I mean some people do. If all you value is money, then it\u2019s a sad story. But if you think that the graphical user interface is a cool thing and you worked on the graphical user interface at Xerox, you can feel like, \u201cThis has a big impact on the world.\u201d FS: It\u2019s a way of looking at the world through a lens of capital rather than labor. I\u2019m sure the people who invented the graphical user interface at Xerox are doing very well for themselves right now. JP: Right. And some of them have a sense of personal satisfaction that they had a big impact, even if they didn\u2019t profit from it at the scale that they could have. Like Delicious was so influential and now people don\u2019t really talk about Delicious. It was Union Square Ventures\u2019s first investment of that kind. It essentially informed their whole thesis of a network of engaged users, watching Delicious and watching it grow. I don\u2019t know if you were ever a big Delicious user. FS: I kept on trying and I never got it. It was hard for me. I don\u2019t know why it was hard for me but it was. JP: It was hard. You compare it to Tumblr and Tumblr was just so much easier and better designed. [Delicious founder] Josh Schachter is brilliant but obtuse. But when people were using it actively, if you cared about the kinds of topics they were talking about, you could look at the stream for the tag and you would find just all these things on a topic you\u2019re totally interested in, streaming in from a tag. It then led to tagging in Flickr. Flickr was like, \u201cOh, Delicious is adding tags\u2014let\u2019s add tags in Flickr.\u201d So anyway, I\u2019m feeling very old talking about all this stuff. FS: And everyone wound up selling to Yahoo in the end. JP: Yes. Flickr sold to Yahoo and then I think, in part, said \u201cDelicious was where we got some of our greatest ideas from.\u201d FS: That\u2019s always a good way to kill a company. JP: Well, there was a moment of people being really excited about, \u201cOh, Yahoo has Flickr and Delicious,\u201d and then that moment passed. But there was a pretty generative early tech scene in New York and Eyebeam was\u2014 FS: In the middle of it. You did that physically, you just found those key nodes and said, \u201cAll right, you guys are coming over for pizza.\u201d JP: The other key thing is I had a very modest budget, but I had a credit card and so I could decide that it was a good use of budget to order beer and pizza and invite six or eight people over every Thursday night or Tuesday night or whatever it was. Josh was working at Morgan Stanley at the time and Paul Berry was working at Charter Mac, which was a publicly-traded real estate company, he was their CTO. [Vlogger] Ze Frank was doing his own Ze Frank stuff, and I\u2019m trying to think who else. Jeff Hahn was at NYU as kind of a researcher-in-residence. Then we\u2019d have guests come through too. The other thing was, Eyebeam was a great place for people to come and share ideas and they would share ideas so freely because it was a non-profit. Seth Goldstein [co-founder of electronic music company DJZ] was the one who really wanted to invest in this re-blog idea; he\u2019d crash meetings: \u201cHey, why don\u2019t you turn this into a business?\u201d And it was too early in that nobody really wanted to make any of this stuff into businesses and saw that as a distraction. It would lead to not being able to generate as many ideas. FS: That\u2019s [technologist] Anil Dash\u2019s whole theory about the web we lost. The minute it all became a business, it all died, in a way. JP: I don\u2019t know I\u2019d totally agree with that. Scaling things, and building a business, and the data that you have when you grow something to a large scale, does allow you to learn certain things that you can\u2019t learn in a lab. The thing that bothered me about Eyebeam was that you\u2019d do some amazing project or event and it would get attention and people would love it and it would be a cool idea and would make people think about new ideas and get excited, and then, at the end of the project, you would start back at zero or you\u2019d have to go write another MacArthur grant, which would take two years. What I learned first at HuffPost is that if you do something and make a splash and build something interesting, then people will give you money to do more stuff. They come to you and say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take this to the next level? Let us invest.\u201d And then you generate revenue, and that allows you to explore more ideas. Then you start saying, \u201cOh, wow, we\u2019re at a scale that starts to be significant relevant to the web as a whole. So we can see, based on that, some things about how people behave and how the ecosystem works.\u201d I did become a convert to building businesses and start-ups. But at the time that I was at Eyebeam, I wasn\u2019t really interested in that. I wasn\u2019t interested in business and I was almost like, \u201cOh, this is just something that constrains you and doesn\u2019t let you explore ideas as freely.\u201d That\u2019s remembering how I thought then, not how I think now. At Eyebeam, I would do a project, it would go well, and then at the end of the project I would have zero budget again and have to start back at zero. Kenny [Lerer] was the one that got me excited about doing business. I wasn\u2019t interested in Huffington Post primarily as a business. I was like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s a cool new opportunity. It\u2019s something different. I\u2019ve been at Eyebeam for a long time. We\u2019ve had this Bush guy in office for a long time.\u201d Back to Top Felix: You\u2019re about to become a publishing person and join the Huffington Post. Tell me the one about how Kenny finds you living out of a cardboard box under a bridge somewhere and says, \u201cI want you to co-found a company with me.\u201d What\u2019s the story there? Jonah: Kenny was doing some political projects, political work. He called together a group of luminaries who knew all about the Internet to help him with his political projects. He had John Borthwick invite all these people. I was not one of those people, but Duncan Watts [principal researcher at Microsoft] was. Duncan was a good friend of mine, and Duncan said, \u201cOh, there\u2019s this rich guy and he\u2019s having all these people come to his office to talk about political stuff. What he really wants is you. You actually make things that spread on the Internet. You should come along.\u201d I was like, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to crash this thing.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cCome on. Come with me.\u201d So [journalist] Jeff Jarvis is there talking about blogging and someone else is talking about MeetUp. There\u2019s someone there who does mobile stuff and there\u2019s someone there who does ad stuff. FS: Arianna\u2019s there? Not yet? JP: Arianna\u2019s not there. Arianna\u2019s in L.A. or wherever she is. We ended up working together on Tom\u2019s petition. That was a project that Kenny was doing with the Brady Campaign. Tom was Daniel Mauser\u2019s dad; Daniel died in Columbine. We built this six degrees of separation kind of visualization so that he could email his friends, they could email their friends, you could track it around the country. Kenny was paying for it. He just believed in the cause. It was interesting for me because I had done things with no connections in the world at all. Everything we made spread from the ground up. We launched with a Bob Herbert column in The New York Times about the initiative. It was super interesting for me to see the way that you could do things on both sides. You could have a model that was based on people sharing things, certain things propagating on the Internet, but you also could have an important cause and call up a reporter that you\u2019ve known for twenty years and have them write up a story. There was this world that I didn\u2019t know anything about that Kenny was enmeshed in. What he said to me was, \u201cI know business, you know the Internet, let\u2019s build something together. Let\u2019s start something.\u201d There wasn\u2019t an idea of what it was going to be, defined. It was just like, we\u2019ve worked together on these things that have been successful. We bring in different pieces to it. It\u2019s very complementary. FS: And you said yes without really knowing what it was going to be. JP: I said yes with the idea that we\u2019d figure out what it is in the future. Then he went to L.A. to this event that he almost skipped, and ends up meeting Arianna. Was just struck by how many people she knew in different worlds, and who looked to her to have intellectual conversations and discuss important things of the day, and realized that that was happening in her house in Brentwood, but not happening on the web. The explosion of blogging was happening at the time. It felt like, \u201cOh, what if this was happening on blogs? What if this was happening on the Internet and not just happening in her house in Brentwood?\u201d He came back very excited, but just started talking about like, \u201cOh, our company with Arianna.\u201d I\u2019d be like, \u201cWhat?\u201d I remember not really knowing who she was, and Googling, and being like, \u201cWait, that\u2019s who were doing this company with?\u201d FS: Did Arianna know what an Internet was at that point? JP: She had the site Arianna Online. She would put her syndicated columns up there. I think both Kenny and Arianna learned an incredible amount from building the Huffington Post. A great way to learn about the Internet is to build one of the biggest sites on the Internet. It\u2019s hard to remember how much we\u2019ve all changed, because we\u2019ve changed so much. In their case, they were more fully formed than I was, but they changed most in their familiarity and embrace of the Internet. I\u2019m, like, day-to-day fully immersed. HuffPost, like any other company, had to keep reinventing itself, and changing its model, and evolving, and building technology, and moving from linking out to other sites on the web to making more content. FS: This is the bit where it gets very interesting, because this is the first time that you even do news. JP: I didn\u2019t do news myself. I was focused on tech and product and traffic and that kind of thing. When we started, Andrew Breitbart was a partner. Andrew had worked previously with Arianna and helped her with Internet things. He went and worked for Matt Drudge after working for Arianna. When Kenny met Andrew he was like, \u201cThis guy is an idiot savant of Internet news.\u201d FS: He was the Neetzan Zimmerman of his time. JP: Andrew was the guy who spent half the day, eight hours a day, posting the links on the Drudge Report. The other eight hours Drudge posted. They could have sixteen hours of coverage. Andrew took the morning shift. We learned a lot from Andrew in the early days, about how the Internet news cycle works. He knew how to go late at night to the British sites to get the morning papers as they were coming out. He knew how to write headlines that were irresistible and how to position stories with a headline. He was, early on, the one who was sort of obsessed with the news. I was just trying to solve this problem, early on, of how do you make something that is both contagious and sticky. I knew that Arianna\u2019s friends, who were on television but not on the Internet, were going to create a sensation if they blogged. You remember when celebrities first started tweeting? Everyone freaked out: \u201cOh, I can\u2019t believe a celebrity\u2019s tweeting.\u201d Blogging at that time was all about people in their pajamas, the person who couldn\u2019t be on TV, the little guy who finally has a voice. I knew that people would freak out if Larry David or Tina Brown or a senator or a congressman started to blog. We knew we could make that happen. We already had all these people committed, from Alec Baldwin to Larry David and Tina Brown\u2014all going to blog for the first time for us on Huffington Post in the first week that we launched. I knew that that would create a sensation, that some people would hate it, and that some people would love it, but that it would be an incredibly exciting development that every blogger would have to watch, and be excited to watch, and want to form an opinion on. That was what would generate the viral spike. The question was, all my previous projects did a spike and then crashed. So I was like, \u201cWhat keeps people there?\u201d One of the stickiest sites on the Internet was the Drudge Report. With always-fresh headlines and splashes and things like that, people would come back every single day. That site was built over a really, really, long period of time, and had the Lewinsky scoop and other things that drove its usage. Tons of people have created clones that never took off, because they\u2019re sticky but not contagious. There were these two models that we just kind of bolted together. One was to make the site itself viral, which was celebrities blogging. I was very focused on making sure that they used the default blogging tools of the Internet. I think that everyone expected us to have some Flash site that wasn\u2019t a real blog. I went to Ben and Mena Trott, who had started Six Apart. We used Movable Type, which at the time was the premiere blogging platform. We modified it a lot in order for it to work, but it had permalinks it was reverse chronological. It had all the things that blogs were supposed to have so that people who knew about blogging would see it and say, \u201cOh, Larry David is blogging.\u201d Not, \u201cLarry David\u2019s doing some weird new thing that Arianna Huffington invented.\u201d We knew that was the piece that was going to make it take off and be contagious. Then Andrew posting links and headlines that were constantly updated would be the thing that made it sticky. You\u2019d come to see the celebrities blogging, you\u2019d say, \u201cWow, what does this mean? That blogging has evolved in this different way.\u201d And then you would say, \u201cOh, there\u2019s a good link here. There\u2019s a good link here.\u201d And you would just keep coming back every day. Even if Larry David didn\u2019t blog again for three months, you\u2019d be checking the site because you\u2019d have great links to content around the web. That was sort of the idea. FS: This is about the same time as Sploid, which was trying to do the same thing. JP: Right, Sploid had the sticky part, but not the contagious part. We had both, but I didn\u2019t know if it would work. We launched with Arianna on the Today Show, big traffic spike, hit a peak a couple days later, decline which I expected, and then I was like, \u201cWhere is it going to plateau?\u201d It did plateau at a pretty high level. There was actually a little bit of investment from John Johnson at Eyebeam. He was like, \u201cShould I invest?\u201d I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to crash down and not work.\u201d Then the plateau was very high, so I said, \u201cJohn, you should invest.\u201d John was the last money in, and invested in the very first round, in part because I told him that. FS: Most of the money was Kenny, presumably. JP: No, there was a bunch of investors. It was a friends-and-family kind of round, but I didn\u2019t have any friends or family who could put any money in. There was no institutional investor. FS: How big was that first round? JP: It was, I think, around a million dollars, something like that. FS: Okay, so small. JP: Well, I guess small to you. FS: You had, what\u2014 JP: Like a dozen people. FS: You can\u2019t support twelve people for very long on a million dollars. JP: We raised again once the site was off and running. It was a small team and it wasn\u2019t like people were making huge salaries. It was a small little upstart. It\u2019s hard to remember that Huffington Post used to just link out and didn\u2019t have any article pages. It was really only in the run-up to the election where we started to realize, \u201cOh, we need to add things other than politics.\u201d It was all politics when we started. Right after election, we\u2019re like, \u201cOh, people are coming, traffic\u2019s growing, but we need entertainment, we need media, we need other verticals.\u201d BuzzFeed was around at that point and I would put a little BuzzFeed widget on posts to see whether the audience would click on it. People clicked on celebrity just as much as politics. I was like, \u201cOh, I bet celebrity will work well in Huffington Post.\u201d FS: So your original vision of grabbing people with boldface names and then keeping them with news\u2014was that a success? JP: That was a success. It wasn\u2019t a model of where the company went, but it was a success as a way of launching the company and getting to a plateau and then getting to grow. I think that\u2019s also why HuffPost, to this day, has a large front page audience. In part, it started it that way. Part of its DNA was thinking of how to build an entry point or front page to the web. FS: The last major media company based around the front page. You do look at these things in hindsight, but certainly the point at which I started really paying attention to HuffPost, it was full-time staffers writing and editing content, who were the meat and potatoes of the site. JP: Yep. FS: At what point do you realize that blogging was not going to cut the mustard on its own? JP: I\u2019m trying to remember what the evolution was. The site was growing but the election was a big part of it. We knew we had to launch other verticals and sections so that after the election, people would see HuffPost as being more than just a political site. We launched those verticals and had to freeze development on all other features. It was a long delay. It was very painful. Everyone had things they wanted built or done. We couldn\u2019t do any of them because we were launching a model to have five or six front pages. One for entertainment, one for media, one for\u00a0\u2026 I forget what the first verticals were, entertainment, media, maybe lifestyle, there was a few others. We launched them and there wasn\u2019t really\u2014they didn\u2019t really generate much traffic. Part of the problem with a home page model is that you have one home page and people don\u2019t really like to go to the secondary pages. We did a lot of work and it didn\u2019t have that much of an impact except that we had hired editors for each vertical and we could put some of those links on the main home page and those were getting clicked and people were seeing those and seeing that the site had done other stuff. What we did after that is we realized, okay, now this vertical section needs to start having more original content and aggregated content. We started to have the entertainment editor use photo wires plus do original writing plus link out to places, and make their own page, and that was something that started to transform the company from being an aggregator on the front page, to being an aggregator on the B page. From there it went from to carrying original content as well. That was sort of an evolution. Around that time, at BuzzFeed we had figured out that you could rapidly swarm a breaking news topic, particularly about a person, place, or thing that was new, like a beauty queen who loses her crown and no one\u2019s heard of this beauty queen. If you make a great page about that thing, you often could get to the top of Google results just as searches were surging. It was partly because Google got faster indexing at that point. Google was slow indexing and then all of a sudden became quick, and BuzzFeed figured that out in the lab, but then HuffPost editors got really good at it and we\u2019d swarm stories very quickly and often be the first news source to create a comprehensive page for what was happening, linking out to other multiple other sources. Those pages became huge growth generators for the site. FS: That was the high point of SEO as a business model, basically. JP: It was something where there was a model that HuffPost had that other people didn\u2019t really fully understand, and that HuffPost got good at. FS: You stayed one step ahead of everyone else for a while on the SEO front. JP: At its best, it was pages that were pretty valuable to the user. Heath Ledger died and people wanted to know what was happening. They do a search and the HuffPost page would have regular updates and links out to the most relevant stories that were happening other places. It was a great page to keep informed of what was happening everywhere. It was clearly written, there were six dedicated people all working on it. At its best, it was great for users and great for the business because it was allowing the company to scale and grow really quickly. When you look at that period, the Huffington Post was much, much, much bigger than it was when it was a blog and a left-leaning Drudge. FS: Obviously, at its worst, it\u2019s \u201cWhat time does the Super Bowl start\u201d and\u2014 JP: I don\u2019t know if that would be the worst. What time the Super Bowl starts is actually useful, if you want to know what time the Super Bowl starts. I don\u2019t think that was ever the best example to make fun of the Huffington Post. Now Google just puts that information natively at the top of the search results. At its worst, SEO is someone finding an inferior article instead of a superior article because the site does a better job of writing for Google, but a worse job for writing for humans. I think that\u2019s when, in my view, you\u2019re over-optimizing. You end up reaching people who are not satisfied with what they\u2019re getting from you. Which isn\u2019t good for a brand. FS: That was the standard criticism of HuffPo, was that it would aggregate these stories and put long lists of wonderfully SEO-optimized tags on the end of them. It would do no real linking and writing, but it would just be parasitical on everyone else. JP: I think there\u2019s an interesting tension between what\u2019s good for the user and what\u2019s good for the industry. That was really created by Google. Say The New Yorker writes a really long 12,000 word piece on Scientology. That takes lots of reporting and lots of investment. That\u2019s important work that ourindustry should embrace and should find ways of supporting economically. The average person who hears about that story doesn\u2019t want to read the whole story. They\u2019re at work, most likely. They do a Google search because they\u2019ve heard about this Scientology scoop or long form piece. Their first result is the HuffPost link, not a New Yorker link. They look at it. It summarizes what the article is about. It says, \u201cHere\u2019s what was in it, here\u2019s what was notable about it.\u201d Has a few tweets from people. This is how people are reacting to it, and if you want to read it, here\u2019s a link and you can go read the article. The problem with that example is that from the perspective of the user, it\u2019s a better experience to land on the summary, to see a little bit of the reactions, and have the option of reading it, because that\u2019s as much as most people want. From the perspective of the industry, it would make much more sense for people to go to The New Yorker article so that they get the traffic, as modest as that ad revenue would be, they get the traffic and they get the people onto their site. There is some conflict between Google saying, \u201cWell we want to serve the consumer,\u201d and sending people to the article that the consumer likes the best. Or is Google supposed to send people to the article that costs the most to produce and supports the industry the most? Does that make sense? There is a little bit of a conflict, or a little bit of a tension. FS: How much of HuffPost\u2019s success do you ascribe to tech, you being able to do stuff on the tech side which no one else could do? JP: People always overestimate their importance to the success of the company. When you talk to the people who are on the sales side, they say, \u201cWell, you know, we drove revenue. That allowed us to invest in all these things. None of the rest of the company would have even been possible if we hadn\u2019t driven that revenue.\u201d You ask the tech people, the product people, they say, \u201cThat\u2019s the competitive advantage of the company. All the other companies had great editors but we had the better tech.\u201d Then you ask people who are on the editorial team and they say, \u201cWell, if you get a scoop, people have to link to it no matter where it is. Great editorial content is really what drives the traffic. The CMS, it can be broken and then stop you from being successful, but if it\u2019s good enough, then editing really is the key and so we really drove a lot of the success.\u201d When there\u2019s a startup that sells, for example, or there\u2019s a startup that\u2019s super successful and is growing, people\u2019s view of who drove the success is very highly correlated to who they know at the company. Chris Dixon will say, \u201cOh, HuffPost is really a tech company and Jonah was a big important part of it.\u201d Because he knows me. But then someone who\u2019s friends with Arianna will say, \u201cArianna\u2019s a force of nature. She is constantly on TV. She was the name and the voice of the site. Her blog posts were constantly in the news cycle. That\u2019s where the site mattered.\u201d If you talk to someone who knows Kenny, they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, Kenny was behind the scenes, building this whole thing and planning this out. He\u2019s done it before, he\u2019ll do it again.\u201d That\u2019s true, not just for HuffPost. It\u2019s true with most companies. The thing you\u2019re closest to, you think has the biggest impact. That, I think, is the cognitive bias that makes it hard for me to answer the question. The system as a whole matters so much. Any one of us who thinks that they\u2019re solely responsible for the success of the company is, by definition, wrong, and the relationship between all the different pieces of the company has to be strong. In some cases, there\u2019s things that aren\u2019t even measurable. Like maybe just having tech, edit, and business teams communicating effectively, is more important. The lines might be more important than the dots. FS: But at the same time, if you\u2019re part of a bigger legacy organization, then you want less communication, broken lines. JP: It depends on how much they can change at all. I think that Janine Gibson coming out to New York and doing something new, a little bit away from Guardian headquarters, is probably a good way to innovate. BuzzFeed\u2019s video operation is in Los Angeles, far from New York, and it\u2019s really thrived in a tremendous way, and part of that is that it wasn\u2019t in the early days seen as a companion to the kind of editorial content we\u2019re doing in New York. Sometimes that helps. To feel like \u201cThis is a new startup,\u201d as opposed to \u201cThis is an offshoot.\u201d FS: I think we\u2019re doing that at Fusion, as well. I think that Fusion is being set up in Miami, which is quite a long way from the more conventional media centers. The Fusion digital team in New York, again, is away from the Fusion TV bit in Miami. The distance can help. It can allow you to be a little bit more innovative and dynamic. JP: Yes. If you\u2019re trying to build something that is disruptive in the [Harvard professor] Clay Christensen sense, within an existing organization, his research, at least, shows that it\u2019s better to do it in a different physical location, even if it\u2019s in the same city, because it\u2019s just too easy to think, \u201cOh, let\u2019s look for synergy. Let\u2019s bundle these things together. Let\u2019s do joint ad sales across digital and print. Let\u2019s make sure that the digital stuff is easy to package into stuff that can be printed.\u201d You spend lots of time with your mind focused on the relationship between the existing business and the new business you\u2019re building, instead of just thinking about how to reach the full potential with the new business. FS: Which is one of the lessons we can draw from the success of All Things D, right? That\u2019s something where Kara [Swisher] and Walt [Mossberg] were absolutely right. They insisted on having basically no contact with the mothership. They were on the other side of the continent, and they did their own thing, and they did it very successfully. In large part because they weren\u2019t constrained by the politics of News Corp. JP: And they built what to them was a big business, but which to News Corp looked like a very small business. The problem is, when you\u2019re embedded in a company where what you\u2019re doing looks like a very small business, it doesn\u2019t get the attention, and even people who work there have trouble taking it seriously because they\u2019re like a little flea compared to the other activities going on in the business. FS: What was your business, at HuffPost? You were working with Kenny and Arianna and Andrew to create this site. Was it always, \u201cWe are going to build a site which will have lots of traffic and then we\u2019re going to sell that traffic to advertisers, that\u2019s the business model\u201d? Was that always there from day one? JP: We never talked in those terms ever. It wasn\u2019t like we were two Stanford computer science graduate students who were like, \u201cLet\u2019s go build a new way of indexing the web.\u201d Or something where there\u2019s a much more aligned kind of view of the world. The worlds that I came from, and Arianna came from, and Kenny came from, and Andrew came from, were very different worlds. FS: You were there all the way through the sale. JP: But I wasn\u2019t there full-time all the way through. Back to Top Felix: When did BuzzFeed start? How did BuzzFeed start? Was that after HuffPost started taking off,? You\u2019re having lunch with Kenny one day, he\u2019s like, \u201cYou know what? You should just create this little viral factory.\u201d Jonah: I kind of missed, a little bit, the Eyebeam environment where you could just experiment with ideas. HuffPost was a real business and we had goals. We were hitting them, and we were growing the company. There were certain ideas that I wanted to play with, particularly because the company that Kenny and I ended up doing, HuffPost was more of a news company and a little bit less of a social content company. FS: It becomes a news company, basically. JP: And it\u2019s more serious. It was hard to do playful experiments on a site that was very serious, without it conflicting with the mission of the site. BuzzFeed was really like, \u201cOh, okay, I have a lab.\u201d It doesn\u2019t cost much to run. John Johnson put the first money into it, and Kenny. I can play around with ideas there. Sometimes when there\u2019s an interesting thing we figure out I can just apply it to HuffPost, which we did on various occasions. It was not really seen as a separate company, it was more like an R&D lab that was separate, with some of the same people involved. FS: It was operated as a for-profit company in terms of funding and stuff, from the beginning. JP: It was an LLC. It didn\u2019t have any institutional investors. FS: Was it non-trivial, raising money for BuzzFeed? JP: Yes, it wasn\u2019t easy raising money in the early days of BuzzFeed. It was always, \u201cIs there any way you can do this without having any writers or content creators or journalists? Can you make this automatic? Could you detect what was trending and then grab stuff from other places and turn it into an article synthetically where the cost of content creation would be zero?\u201d FS: That\u2019s always the big thing in Silicon Valley. They buy Nick D\u2019Aloisio just because it\u2019s all algo based. JP: It can be algorithms or it can be the user doing the work for free. Twitter and Facebook are exciting because their cost of content creation is zero. You can imagine them scaling without having to hire lots and lots of people. WhatsApp is exciting to them because you have fifty-some employees and reach massive scale. The kind of leverage you can have if you\u2019re a tech company is really phenomenal, but when you look at media companies through history, they\u2019ve had a different kind of leverage. If you\u2019re a newspaper that has a circulation of five million there\u2019s a lot more leverage than if you\u2019re a newspaper that has a circulation of one hundred thousand. Media businesses can have leverage, but it\u2019s different. FS: At what point did you start concentrating increasingly on BuzzFeed? JP: I went from being one day a week on BuzzFeed and four days a week on HuffPost, to being half and half, and then to being one day at HuffPost and four days at BuzzFeed. Although, it was hard to just to go to the manager meetings on Mondays at HuffPost, and it was very hard to not spend lots of my time when I was at BuzzFeed thinking about HuffPost. HuffPost was scaled up and there was all of this stuff going on, the stakes were really high. There was politics. Navigating all these things, my brain cycles were kind of stuck on HuffPost more than they should have been. When HuffPost sold, it was possible to say, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t need to think about this stuff at all.\u201d All of that energy and focus went into BuzzFeed and what should BuzzFeed do. We had this little widget on the front page of Huffington Post, and that was sending traffic to BuzzFeed. I was like, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re getting the tie-in at HuffPost which benefits BuzzFeed too, so I don\u2019t have to feel that guilty.\u201d But at a certain point, that widget was removed. I was like, \u201cOkay, now the traffic\u2019s going to drop at BuzzFeed\u2014now I\u2019ve got to figure out how to make BuzzFeed stand on its own two feet.\u201d That\u2019s when I went half-time. FS: This is actually something you\u2019re incredibly well suited for, because what you do is create things which grow, and this is what people want to invest in, things which grow. Rather than, \u201cThis is a nice corner store which I can use to support my family for the foreseeable future.\u201d JP: Yeah. Right or wrong, Wall Street and VCs and angel investors are very focused on growth. It makes a huge difference to the valuation of the company if it\u2019s growing fast or if it\u2019s growing slowly. FS: [Venture capitalist] Paul Kedrosky, a few years ago now, did this study for the Kauffman Foundation, where he says that, if you look at all the fastest growing companies in America at any given time, only 5 percent to 10 percent of them are taking VC money. Having an emphasis on very fast growth is probably necessary to get that money, but it\u2019s definitely not sufficient. Most fast-growing companies don\u2019t. That\u2019s probably a good thing, really. Because the VCs, as you\u2019ve discovered, have a habit of biting off parts of your anatomy, which you\u2019d really rather\u2014 JP: I like venture-backed companies. I think VCs in general are great to be partnered with if you have the same goals. If you want to build a giant company relatively quickly, in an emerging space where the market isn\u2019t mature enough to generate a lot of revenue early on, then VCs are the perfect partner. If you want to own 100 percent of a company and build it over twenty years, even if it\u2019s a fairly fast growing company, in a market where revenue is booked quickly and ideally where the revenue comes before you have to sell the product so you have nice cash flow to build a business from, then it\u2019d be great to do it without VCs. If you want to build a business that generates $10 million a year in revenue and $2 million a year that goes to you and your partner, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re interested in, then you should figure out how to bootstrap. A lot of agency businesses are that way. When you look around New York, there\u2019s a lot of really successful fifty-person boutique agencies, where the people who started them are making a lot of money and no VC would ever touch them. If you read the tech blogs, they converge into this idea that the only way to build a good company is a venture-backed company and it probably should be in Silicon Valley, but maybe it could be in New York or a couple other places, and no other company matters. That is clearly false. If you\u2019re a budding entrepreneur who wants to start a business, depending on the idea and depending on your temperament, it might be great for you to take VC money, or it might be terrible for you to take VC money. It just depends. FS: I feel like you like the discipline, you like the VCs. JP: I like that they\u2019re all steeped in, or a lot of them are steeped in, Clay Christiensen\u2019s philosophy. I like to be working in sectors where there\u2019s no clear model to find yet, where things like social and mobile and online video or things that are still evolving so quickly that there\u2019s not a clear, stable business there yet. I like to be in the kind of places where things are being formed. I like growth-oriented companies. It\u2019s exciting to me to have a different job every year because the scale of the organization is different and the types of things that you\u2019re able to do are different and the kinds of problems you face are different. That\u2019s exciting to me, more than having a stable company. I like the dynamism of that. VC-backed is great. But it\u2019s not for everyone. For example\u2014this is a totally different example\u2014 4chan should not have been VC-backed. [Founder] Chris Poole has resisted the idea of funding it, even though it\u2019s a big site and you could expand it in various ways. FS: And famously, Mashable never took outside funding until a couple months ago. Which may or may not have been the right decision. JP: Yeah. It\u2019s hard to know. It depends on what your goal is. FS: Your goal was\u2026 what? BuzzFeed has been around a long time. It started as a crazy skunkworks ideas thing. JP: Yep. FS: You then raised a round from SoftBank, and now it\u2019s a real thing. Now you\u2019re like, \u201cWe are going to be this thing which finds memes and just really manages to glom onto whatever people are caring about the most on the Internet.\u201d This is before the whole concept of social. JP: At that stage, the site was a proof of concept for the technology. We were thinking of building a technology platform, and then the site was a proof of concept. It wasn\u2019t like, \u201cOh, we want to make the site big.\u201d But if the site didn\u2019t grow, the proof of concept wouldn\u2019t work. We even had a conversation with The Washington Post about them using our technology to optimize The Washington Post. FS: The technology was, basically, just trying to work out what people were buzzing about. JP: We had something called Buzz Bot, which would IM you links. We built something called the Trend Detector, which we crawled from Jason Kottke\u2019s blog to a bunch of different blogs. Then we would look to see acceleration of URLs being cited in blogs. Then that would show up on the Trend Detector. Then Peggy, our founding editor, would look at the Trend Detector for interesting stories. If the number one thing in the Trend Detector was, \u201cWordpress has a new plugin,\u201d she\u2019d ignore it. If it was a news story or a new trend or a new product, she would then write a little summary of the story and then put the best links below it. The format for the summary was, imagine you\u2019re at a cool party, you go up to someone and the first sentence is, \u201cDid you hear about X?\u201d It just sort of describes what X is. If they haven\u2019t heard about it they kind of get it, and if they have heard about it, it doesn\u2019t take that long. \u201cSo, have you heard about degentrification, where the prices of a neighborhood start going down?\u201d or whatever. That\u2019s the first sentence. The next one to four sentences were opinion or point-of-view or commentary or a joke or something. Sort of what you would say afterwards. That was the beginning. It was just all these simple little \u201cone sentence plus three sentences,\u201d describing something that usually she found in the Trend Detector or sometimes she found in Greenpoint, hanging out with friends of hers. Six or eight or ten links about degentrification or about this new kind of shoe, or this new kind of fashion, or this new idea. Some of them were more trendspotting, and some of them were driven by this technology. That was the original BuzzFeed. We did five things a day. It was just these five things. In that memo I wrote about Time magazine and the history of media, that was the period when we were kind of similar to what Time was in the early days, which is: There were a few editors subscribing to lots of newspapers, reading the newspapers, and then summarizing them into a more digestible form in Time so that an intelligent reader with not that much time on their hands could quickly digest the important stories of the day. Peggy was just doing the equivalent. She was reading all these things on the Internet and using the Trend Detector, and then putting it in a very digestible format so that you could be informed of what were the trends happening on the Internet, what was propagating and getting shared across the Internet. She was a former computer programmer and wrote in a very clear language, but also had a sense of humor. That was the very first product. FS: Were you surprised, or not surprised, at how newsy it was? How much of what you might conceivably find in a newspaper would be in those five things? And how much of it was dogs on skateboards? JP: It wasn\u2019t really dogs on skateboards. In those days, it was more people, places, things that were trending, which often was news: the beauty queen losing her crown for some scandal. That was something that unexpectedly ended up being a top search result. We\u2019re like, \u201cWhoa, Google works totally differently now. It\u2019s like, this has done as much traffic as a front-page Digg link, and it\u2019s some story that just happened. Google used to take a week to index anything that was breaking news, and now they\u2019re doing it right away. Oh, that\u2019s interesting.\u201d It would be like, \u201cMilitaries are now using unmanned aircrafts to do strategic killings of potential terrorists,\u201d then some little commentary on it, then links to all the stories about it. But it wouldn\u2019t be, \u201cEight people die in Iraq in a bombing and the US responds with a drone attack on a terrorist and\u2026.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t be like a whole news thing. FS: At this point, it\u2019s more reactive. You\u2019re not creating stuff which is designed to go viral. You\u2019re just identifying the stuff which is already viral and amplifying it. JP: Exactly. That\u2019s exactly right. That was true for the first couple years. FS: You can make a distinction between that and HuffPo, where HuffPo wasn\u2019t chasing those things in quite the same way, although it knew what people were searching for. JP: HuffPost was contagious and sticky. BuzzFeed was just a little sticky. Often, television producers would read BuzzFeed, and they\u2019d say, \u201cI\u2019m getting these new trends and I\u2019m always ahead of the curve.\u201d People would describe it as a secret. Their friends would say, \u201cHow come you always would send me all these interesting stories?\u201d None of them are BuzzFeed stories, but they were finding them on BuzzFeed. Every day, they were learning from Peggy what the cool things were on the Internet and finding them, clicking through to them, and then that\u2019s what they would share. In a way, it\u2019s similar to Huffington Post starting with a front page linking out to other sites, and then making content themselves. We were doing a similar thing. Then we started to have a really good understanding of what people share and why people share things and what stories are interesting. And we said, \u201cOh, why don\u2019t we make our own? Why don\u2019t we make some of these things? Instead of just tracking culture, why don\u2019t we influence culture by making great entertainment, great news, and content that people want to share?\u201d Initially, it wasn\u2019t news, but making great things that people think are worth sharing and passing on to their friends. That became a focus. The editorial team grew to about twelve people. A lot of those few people, like Matt Stopera, who started as an intern, started making these lists and really narrating a story in such a way that it would get people excited and people would love it enough to pass on to their friends and share. Around that time HuffPost sold, and then soon after we hired [former Politico writer] Ben Smith, and that was really the moment we went from being a tech company experimenting with content to being a company that took editorial seriously. Not just serious editorial, but that took entertaining content seriously, and news content seriously, and had a more ambitious editorial mission. A more ambitious sense of what it means to make content, or make original content. FS: Did you hire Ben because you felt that it would give you a certain amount of respectability or gravitas that you needed in order to get your brand clients to take you seriously? JP: It wasn\u2019t clear to me that Ben would generate a bunch of revenue through gravitas. It was really intellectually driven in the sense of I was trying to understand, and am still trying to understand, why certain ideas spread and other ideas don\u2019t spread, why certain things become popular, why other things become popular, other things don\u2019t become popular, how people learn, how people make decisions, and to use that knowledge to inform people and entertain people. We had this huge hole; it was obvious we had this big hole. It was particularly obvious to Kenny, who never loved the fun, playful Internet comedy. He wanted the site to be more serious too. It was internally very evident. Matt Stopera was saying, \u201cwe have one arm tied behind our back because we\u2019re missing news and reporting which should be part of the mix of the stuff that matters, particularly when there\u2019s a big news story happening and everyone is turning to it and interested in it.\u201d That was a big part of it. It was like, \u201cOkay, the web is growing up. The social web is growing up. We need to grow up. And we need to add capacity to do all kinds of stuff that we\u2019re not doing now.\u201d Ben came in and instead of saying, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do any of the fun stuff,\u201d he said, \u201cwe have to do more of that. We have to do it faster. We have to do it better.\u201d While simultaneously admitting it wasn\u2019t his expertise. He really empowered people to step up and do more entertaining web culture type content, while also hiring reporters first for politics and to go after the election cycle and then in other areas. FS: Ben kind of got it naturally? JP: No. He said, \u201cI get what you\u2019re doing. It seems really interesting. I\u2019m not your guy.\u201d He remembers the conversation as, interesting ideas, plus a bunch of jargon about the social web. Really it was Peter Kaplan talking with Ben, and also Kenny talking to Ben, but in particular Peter talking to Ben about how every election cycle, there\u2019s a new site that emerges that captures the spirit of the election, and that BuzzFeed could be that site and here\u2019s how I would do it. Peter had a meeting with Ben where he really made Ben switch from thinking \u201cThis is a good idea for someone else\u201d to \u201cThis is a good idea for me.\u201d FS: Do you think that worked? Do you think in hindsight that BuzzFeed kind of nailed the 2012 election? JP: I think we did. But it wasn\u2019t until later, it wasn\u2019t until the Boston bombings, that we saw people coming to us for news. We had reporters on the ground and we were the first site to authenticate suspect No. 2's Twitter account by looking at his avatar, looking at who he was following, getting two of his followers on the phone to confirm that they went to high school with him. There were things that we were able to do because we were very savvy with understanding the structure of the social web, and because we had reporters. We could wade through Reddit and Instagram with more knowledge than a lot of traditional publications, but we also had reporters on the ground interviewing people, which was something that a lot of the pure web companies didn\u2019t have. From that point, we said, \u201cOkay, we see that breaking news is going to be a bigger part. Not just people coming via Twitter, but people coming to BuzzFeed for news, particularly when there\u2019s big news.\u201d That\u2019s when we hired Lisa Tozzi [formerly of The New York Times] and then, after that, expanded our foreign coverage with Miriam Elder from the Guardian, hiring foreign correspondents. Now we have two people in the Ukraine. We are still at the beginning of the investment in news, but it really started as breaking political scoops and earning the respect of insiders, to then having younger people coming to us for their news, to now expanding into a broader news mission. FS: The election, you\u2019re getting most of your traffic from Twitter, which we know is always a tiny fraction of the fire hose that is Facebook. For me, mentally, as Twitter is to Facebook, in terms of size and importance, so is news to the rest of BuzzFeed, the core viral stuff. It\u2019s important, and it\u2019s the kind of stuff which media people tend to notice. But in terms of attention or page views or whatever metric you want to use, it\u2019s still always going to be the tail, not the dog. JP: I think that\u2019s true, not just at BuzzFeed, but if you look at a television network, American Idol has higher ratings than the evening news. FS: Even so, it is using a massively disproportionate amount of your resources. You\u2019re investing a huge amount in news, compared to cats. JP: We\u2019re definitely making a big investment in news. It is generating considerable attention and traffic and influence. I think you\u2019ll see more of it. Back to Top Felix: How much A/B testing do you do? On a scale from one to Upworthy? Jonah: We do a lot of testing and we look at lots of metrics, but ultimately the raw material is people coming up with creative ideas. We have lots of meetings with five or six people siting in a room brainstorming about what they could create. You have a lot of reporters saying like, \u201cOh, what stories are we going to cover?\u201d None of that is directly tied to any metrics. Although having seen what people\u2019s response is in the past, it actually might give people a gut feeling. FS: You have to have some kind of a model. If you\u2019re asking yourself, \u201cWhat stories are we going to cover?\u201d you need a criterion so that once you\u2019ve decided to cover a story, you can then go back and look at that and decide whether it was successful or not. That\u2019s going to be metric based. You can be like, \u201cThat was a good idea to cover that story because it did really well\u201d or \u201cThat was not a good idea to cover that story because no one cared.\u201d JP: I\u2019m trying to think how to describe this. It\u2019s not that we celebrate maximizing the metrics. We want the stuff we do to reach the maximum audience it should reach, no less and no more. If we make a wonky political scoop, we want every political wonk to read it. If we make \u201cWhich state should you actually live in,\u201d we want everyone who lives in a city to read it. Most A/B testing is just user experience. Is this page loading fast? Do the share buttons work well? It\u2019s not A/B testing the content, it\u2019s A/B testing the site and the platform. When we have something that\u2019s a hit, usually our response is not, \u201cLet\u2019s do more of those.\u201d Our response is, \u201cLet\u2019s figure why this is a hit and make variations of this.\u201d This was successful because it was tied to someone\u2019s identity, it was successful because it had cats in it, or it was successful because it had humor, or it was successful because it tapped into nostalgia. If you\u2019re making entertainment content, which is a big part of what we do, you look at that hit and you say, \u201cWhy was that successful? Can I do it again? Can I make something else that people really love and want to share?\u201d And you try to vary it, even though you know doing something derivative would work. Long term, you want to have a deeper understanding of how to make great things. That\u2019s really the focus. That comes from people in a room talking and saying, \u201cOh, let\u2019s try this, let\u2019s try that.\u201d And valuing people doing new things, not just valuing people doing big things. You see a very massive skew between different items. A problem I think in people writing about the media now is that people take averages and then they make statements like, \u201cThe average piece of branded content gets this many Facebook shares\u201d or \u201cThe average longform story gets this many views.\u201d FS: Everything online is barbelled, right? JP: Everything is just very skewed. When you say barbelled, it depends on what the graph is. But if you rank things in order of whatever the metric is and then you do a graph, it\u2019s always this very skewed distribution. I feel like what you see in the industry now is people jumping around and trying to find the God metric for content. It\u2019s all about shares or it\u2019s all about time spent or it\u2019s all about pages or it\u2019s all about uniques. The problem is you can only optimize one thing and you have to pick, otherwise all you\u2019re doing is making a bunch of compromises if you try to optimize for multiple things. So you pick the one that matters and maybe you have minimum thresholds for a few others. The problem with that is that the natural inclination, if one metric is seen as the important, true metric \u2014 FS: Is to game it. JP: Is to game it. And then when you game it, you essentially are creating a fake version of that metric. So page views are a metric of how many stories people want to read\u2014and then you split the story in two. You essentially are doubling your pages for that story, or not quite, probably, because not everyone will click. But you create pyrite page views. If you\u2019re looking at clicks, if there\u2019s a story that says \u201cMalaysian airliner, new developments,\u201d and you want to know about new developments in that story and you read the story and there\u2019s a new development, then you\u2019re happy and the click rate is actually pretty accurate. If you click and there\u2019s actually no new developments or the story is actually about something else\u2014 FS: Or if it just takes you to a web page, which has a link to another web page with new developments\u2014 JP: So the bigger issue is not which metric is the most important metric. You\u2019ll see some sites talking about time as being the metric. FS: That\u2019s [Upworthy founder] Eli [Pariser\u2019s] thing. JP: He said Upworthy were switching. The challenge there is that, like you said, if you create a long, meandering, boring story that\u2019s just good enough to keep people reading, they might spend more time on that story than the short, condensed one that just tells you what you need to know. If you use time on that one, it will tell you to do the wrong thing. FS: The thing about time, with Eli in particular, is it\u2019s skewed toward video content. People love being able to click Play and then sit back and watch a seven-minute video. It seems to me to be less engaged than if you\u2019re actually concentrating and reading something for seven minutes. JP: One of the reasons reality TV became so dominant was because people looked at time as being the metric. And the reason that reality TV works well for time is that the classic reality TV formula, in the beginning, was the tribal council and somebody getting eliminated. So you could have 50 percent of the show being boring filler and you\u2019re kind of wanting to change the channel but you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, but I wonder if my favorite person\u2019s going to get eliminated.\u201d So you have to watch to the end to see the elimination. In a way, that was a way of gaming time. You could look at that and say, \u201cOh, they spent an hour watching this show, including the commercials. That means it must be a really high quality show.\u201d But it also might just mean that they figured out a hook that incentivizes you to watch to the end and then did a lot of mediocre content in the middle. So there\u2019s not going to be one metric that you look at. I love metrics and I love thinking about optimization, but I think that the optimal state is being slightly suboptimal because as soon as you try to actually optimize, particularly for a single metric, you end up finding that the best way to optimize for that metric ends up perverting the metric and making the metric mean the opposite of what it used to mean. FS: Where does the discipline come in in terms of deciding not to do things? You can take that viral value, and you can have the quick hits which people love to share, and the deep thoughts that people love to share, and kind of ignore a lot of the boring day-to-day stuff in between, which is eat-your-greens news. But at the same time, you want people building quizzes for years before you finally manage to get them right, and they suddenly take off, and you\u2019re like, \u201cWow, quizzes, wow.\u201d Is there any kind of discipline involved in saying, \u201cNo, we\u2019re not going to do that\u201d? Or is that not part of this process? JP: I don\u2019t know that there is a list of like, \u201cThese are things we don\u2019t do.\u201d I think there\u2019s some cases where it\u2019s clear that someone is trolling for attention and they have fabricated some hoax story that is designed to get picked up everywhere and are pitching it to every editor of BuzzFeed and we send an internal email saying, \u201cDon\u2019t pick this up. Nobody touch this. Don\u2019t get tricked by this person.\u201d Even though you could just\u2014there\u2019s lots of sites who will run that story and get a lot of traffic. We also have our no-haters orientation. We tend to be enthusiastic and we tend to avoid snarky articles about mediocre things. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s some hard rule. In general, we tend to avoid a post that is designed to make the author feel smart and superior and the reader to vicariously feel smart and superior because a Hollywood film is mediocre or because something in culture is mediocre. FS: Honest enthusiasm is a sort of default stance at BuzzFeed. JP: If there\u2019s something that is worth someone\u2019s time that is interesting and is worthy of being excited about, we should cover that. If there\u2019s an egregious miscarriage of justice or corruption or fraud or something that needs to be investigated, those are both strong things. In the middle, there\u2019s a lot of things that are kind of a waste of time. Mediocre things that you can write cynical comments about. FS: Is the church-state wall important to you? JP: Yes, it\u2019s important. Definitely it\u2019s important. FS: Why? JP: Well, particularly with reporters it matters a lot, but even with people making entertainment content. The idea that we are making a quiz that involves characters from a TV show, and then we are also pitching business to market that TV show\u2014it creates a conflict of interest. If you put the consumer first and you say, \u201cWe want to make stuff that people love,\u201d then the editorial team should not have to stress or worry about the business side at all. They should just make stuff that they think consumers will love. That\u2019s why the wall\u2019s important, but when it comes to platform and technology then there isn\u2019t a wall. It goes across the whole organization and company. When you abstract away from a particular piece of the content to how do we serve the content, and how do we optimize the content, what formats are there, that\u2019s stuff where you want to make great formats for people whether it\u2019s for a piece of branded content or whether it\u2019s editorial content. There\u2019s not a wall when it comes to things like data science and product and tech. FS: Do you think this is going to turn into success for Ezra\u2019s [Klein] thing? Brands want to be \u201cthought leaders.\u201d They love the idea that there\u2019s a formula out there where they can get their ideas out into the world and they can explain things to the world more boldly and have that position. JP: Yes, if he\u2019s better than the market at that. Some of what you were describing earlier about digital publishers being small relative to the traditional media and relative to television, actually it\u2019s because early-stage digital publishers have stayed too close to print. They look like print. Their basic unit is the same kind of article structure. Some of them might be shorter or longer, but the front page is programmed almost like a newspaper. The formats of the articles are more like a newspaper. And it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, let\u2019s add a little video,\u201d but when they add video it\u2019s like they are trying to be TV, but it\u2019s not quite as good as regular TV. The way to break through and to make something that can actually scale into something big is just to say, \u201cWhat would this be if the readers and the publishers were not focused on making something similar to print?\u201d If they said, instead, \u201cWhat should this be if mobile is the most important thing; if things can be more visual; if things can be more shareable; if length can be anywhere from 140 characters to 12,000 words? In that kind of world, where things can be interactive, like quizzes\u2014in that kind of a world, what should a media company be?\u201d I think if people can figure that out, they can build really big businesses. If you look at the branded content that you were just describing\u200a\u2014\u200athe informative kind of branded content\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s often like a special advertising section, and it\u2019s the kind of thing that reads like a magazine article and it\u2019s always like a page long and feels so of the world of print; whereas so much of BuzzFeed is sort of scrolling on a smartphone and that\u2019s the best way to consume it. Publishers should figure out how to re-invent what the informative branded content would be. We\u2019ve had some success with list formats that are very informative. In a grand sense it needs to move away from mimicking print to doing what is natural for the web. FS: What we seem to be talking about here is a world where what you\u2019re selling is domain expertise. \u201cWe really understand what works in this world, for this audience, on these platforms, and if you want to create something which works in this world, for this audience, on these platforms, come to us and we can help you.\u201d Which is very different from a traditional print or television media company where they\u2019re selling an audience. They\u2019re saying, \u201cHere\u2019s an audience, do with it what you will. We\u2019ll give you a page; put something on that page. We\u2019ll give you thirty seconds, put something in those thirty seconds. Do you need to be selling expertise more than inventory in order to really make it work in digital? JP: When BuzzFeed started, people would ask me for expertise a lot because of the Nike email, the Rejection Line, Black People Love Us. It was, \u201cOh, you have this expertise on how to make things go viral\u200a\u2014\u200amake my things go viral.\u201d Part of the idea of BuzzFeed from the beginning was can we get to the point where the platform is more valuable than the expertise? If you actually have an idea or an insight into how things are shared or why they\u2019re shared or what works, can you build that into either the technology platform or the data science or the culture of a team of people? Or build an audience that reads the site and engages with the site in a certain way that it gives you an advantage to be able to launch something that will take off? If you can do that, that\u2019s like much better than being a consulting team where you drone on about, \u201cThis is why something goes viral, that\u2019s why something goes viral.\u201d A lot of the focus that we\u2019ve had is to figure out do we really know something, and then how do we build that into a platform and how do we build that into a process? If someone said to me, \u201cHelp me market a movie, or help me market a new product, but just do it as a consultant,\u201d I would do a much worse job and there would not be as much that I could do as if I said, \u201cLet\u2019s do a partnership with BuzzFeed.\u201d Because when they do a partnership with BuzzFeed they get a big audience. They get reach, there\u2019s technology, there\u2019s different formats, there\u2019s people that have lots of creative ideas that I wouldn\u2019t have come up with that work at the company\u200a\u2014\u200aand all those things together will result in a much better marketing campaign for an advertiser than if I was just peddling expertise. I think the expertise matters, but the expertise needs to find its way into a platform. And also having reach makes a huge difference. FS: So the reach in that sense is necessary, but not sufficient? JP: Yes. We could just put a bunch of ad networks on our site and lay off our business team, and we\u2019d be a much less interesting business. FS: Conversely, if I have a site which gets loads of traffic, but I can\u2019t offer that deep understanding of the domain, then all I can do is sell a bunch of programmatic ads for three cents. JP: Yes. It\u2019s one of the reasons why there was some benefit to struggling to raise money in the early days, and trying lots of things, and experimenting in lots of different directions. We learned a lot during that period. I think it\u2019s hard when you see certain companies that they launch and six months after they launch they get this crazy hockey stick and their service is huge. Then they\u2019re running this huge thing and they\u2019re not sure why it works or how it works. It\u2019s hard to experiment when you have tens of millions of users. FS: Was there a conscious decision made at any point at BuzzFeed that you would avoid the curiosity-gap thing? JP: Well, at HuffPost I remember there was a very talented editor who now works at the Daily Mail who figured that out. You could show a picture of like an older guy at the beach and be like, \u201cGuess whose body this is?\u201d Then you click and it\u2019s like, \u201cOh it\u2019s Giorgio Armani\u201d or whatever, and you could get a tremendous clickthrough rate on headlines that didn\u2019t tell you what the story is about. The problem with that is that if you\u2019re just getting clicks that would have gone to another headline on your front page, it\u2019s sending people the content that might not be as good, because they\u2019re clicking because they want to know what\u2019s there. They\u2019re not clicking because they\u2019re interested in what\u2019s there. If they knew that it was Giorgio Armani\u200a\u2014\u200aif you just did a post saying, \u201cHere\u2019s a picture of Giorgio Armani on the beach\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200apeople who care about that sort of thing would click and people who didn\u2019t wouldn\u2019t. You end up with lots of people who don\u2019t actually want to see Giorgio Armani in a Speedo on the beach clicking that and then feeling like, \u201cOh god, why did I do that?\u201d Like, \u201cThat was a waste of time.\u201d The main problem for us is that when you think from the perspective of the reader, if headlines are all devoid of information and you have to click them to find out what they are about, all the social streams out there would become much less useful and much less valuable. When you think from that perspective it\u2019s like, \u201cWhoa, let\u2019s just make headlines that describe what\u2019s in the article and that\u2019s better for the consumer and it\u2019s better for the ecosystem as a whole. Then let\u2019s make articles that people really want to click because they\u2019re interested in them, not because they\u2019re wondering what it\u2019s about.\u201d Then in some rare cases there\u2019s something that say is impossible to describe and beautiful and weird. You might say, \u201cThis is beautiful and weird and you have to see it to understand it,\u201d and in that scenario that\u2019s not really anything else you can do. FS: John Herrman [then of BuzzFeed, now of The Awl] wrote that piece about headlines. JP: John wrote a piece saying the Internet provides many headlines for every article, sometimes better than what the author wrote, and that there just shouldn\u2019t be headlines on articles. Headlines are generated on Twitter and all these different places and it is something that we think a lot about. What do people add to a story when they share it? In some cases it\u2019s better than the headline that our team wrote and in some cases shows why content matters to them. Because you say, \u201cI\u2019m sharing this\u201d and explain why you\u2019re sharing it. FS: What BuzzFeed doesn\u2019t do, which I see a lot in the rest of the media world, is the secret-project-then-launch thing. JP: Well, partly it\u2019s that secret ideas rarely work. Coming up with some brilliant secret idea and then launching it and having it work the way we planned, that would be nice if that happened, but that essentially never happens anywhere. Maybe it happened with a string of Apple product releases that Steve Jobs was able to pull off\u2014and was that a rare genius or was it luck or was it both? It\u2019s hard to say, but it\u2019s not a good model to operate a business on for most people. FS: I think far too many people think it\u2019s all about ideas. JP: Sometimes you see people who say ideas don\u2019t matter. Some VCs say it\u2019s all about execution. There are other search engines and Google beat them and there were other social networks and Facebook beat them and it\u2019s all about execution and ideas don\u2019t matter. Sometimes you see people saying, \u201cWhen did you come up with the idea for BuzzFeed,\u201d and, like, \u201cWow how did you come up with that idea?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re talking about. I don\u2019t know what idea you mean because there was a space that we were exploring and there\u2019s a constellation of related ideas.\u201d Being able to generate new ideas that help improve what you\u2019re doing is really important for a company, but the execution is also super important. FS: Nick Denton says he\u2019s in a blood feud with you. There are definitely a lot of media types\u200a\u2014\u200aand Nick would completely admit to being one of them\u200a\u2014\u200awho like to define themselves against the competition and think of it as a race with winners and losers. How important is it to you to beat the competition? And who is the competition? JP: It\u2019s possible that it becomes more important as we get bigger, but for almost every startup the competition doesn\u2019t really matter that much. The competition matters usually at the level of public companies or larger companies where they\u2019re starting to bump up into the total size of the market. Then maybe the market\u2019s growing at 6 percent or 10 percent a year and there\u2019s competitors in there. FS: You have 100 percent of the market in BuzzFeed ads. JP: Well in BuzzFeed ads yes. There is an emerging space\u2014it\u2019s unclear how big the space is going to be if you think on the ad side. If you think the kind of advertising were doing, we have a good leadership position. It is less about competing against another company and it\u2019s more about building a larger ecosystem and making something sustainable. That could mean that it\u2019s better for Vice and Vox to thrive because it starts to create a new guard of ambitious purely digital companies that will help transform the landscape. When they have conversations with brands and talk about how you can do big things in video and big things online and big things in social, that helps shift the budget into a larger market that we are in. That\u2019s a good thing for us. FS: My feeling about Vice is that they do a better job of selling how cool they are than they actually do of selling the brands who come to them. JP: I don\u2019t know what research they do, but I think they do take it pretty seriously. And I think that you can get to a certain level with smoke and mirrors, but if you don\u2019t have something real I don\u2019t think you get into the hundreds of millions of revenue. FS: What\u2019s their secret? JP: They have a very strong and clear brand and even when the brand has moved and evolved it\u2019s been very consistent at any given time. They\u2019re very good at making content for a particular consumer that is not as broad a mainstream consumer as BuzzFeed or more pop kind of site, but that there is certain people who are obsessed with what Vice does. I have met a young person who knew all their videos and were like, \u201cIt\u2019s so badass and I can\u2019t believe they did this.\u201d FS: Those people do exist. JP: If you watch their stuff, it\u2019s good quality. To me it\u2019s, like, more motivating to see other people doing good stuff. If you\u2019re in a space where everything sucks and you\u2019re pointing to another competitor and saying, \u201cOh, look at how terrible they are,\u201d then how does that motivate you to do good work? I think you look at Vice and you say wow. You can watch some of the documentary video that they\u2019ve made and say they understand what they\u2019re doing. They have a clear brand and they\u2019re telling a good story. Back to Top Felix: This is BuzzFeed 2014. You have this job that you love, which changes every year. What\u2019s the big difference between this and where you were a year or two ago? Jonah: One big difference is international, and another big difference is video. BuzzFeed UK is a decent size operation now. We are close to a billion video views in the first 14 months of BuzzFeed Video being done. What Ze is building there has really been interesting and changing, so video is becoming a bigger and bigger part of the business. The ability to do lots of things at once has increased. It used to be that we could only really do one thing at once and now we\u2019re doing many things in parallel. Managing that is challenging, but there\u2019s so much more we\u2019re able to do. The biggest concrete things are video and international. Then the mobile app\u2014it\u2019s just growing. It\u2019s grown over 400 percent in the last year. It\u2019s more and more consumption happening on mobile. Those are the biggest shifts. FS: The revenue model, is that going to stay the same for the foreseeable? JP: The basic revenue model is having an understanding and a technology platform for the distribution of social content. That model will be the same. We\u2019ll be more on mobile, we\u2019ll be more video, it\u2019ll be more international, but the general model will be that brands become more like publishers and the best guide for them is a publisher\u2014that really has a deep understanding of how this stuff works, and has a technology to support it; that if they want to go deep with someone to really take branding content to the next level, it should be us. That\u2019s sort of the plan. FS: I read your memo, which was a real rah-rah. JP: Too rah-rah for you? Too American? FS: It was too earnest. Don\u2019t you think? JP: Would you rather work for someone who\u2019s cynical, or someone who earnestly believes in what they\u2019re doing? FS: I really like the stuff you would often read in the back of Wired magazine, or Spy magazine, or any time that Denton talks about himself, that very English sort of, \u201cWe don\u2019t take ourselves too seriously. We laugh at each other and decide that we have no idea what we\u2019re doing.\u201d It\u2019s a little bit of fun modesty, but also, there\u2019s a humanity to it. JP: I don\u2019t think we take ourselves that seriously. I think the challenge is how do you be humble about what you know, because there\u2019s nobody to learn from if you\u2019re arrogant. And at the same time, be ambitious and say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to do big things.\u201d They\u2019re kind of at odds, but I feel like the best way to operate in a fast-growing startup is to be able to do both. It is a tricky balance. I just think people having fun and people who are enjoying their work and people who are laughing about what they\u2019re doing and feeling like you can make a mistake and it\u2019s not like you get yelled at or you get fired, are all pretty important. And underappreciated by a lot of companies. FS: You\u2019ve got this very digitally-native, digital-only franchise. I\u2019m sure that people have come up to you saying you should do a BuzzFeed TV program on cable TV or something. JP: Yes. FS: What that doesn\u2019t really address is the bigger picture which is where, does digital fit into the broader media landscape? Are we still, for the foreseeable future, basically living in a television world where everything else is an afterthought, and you\u2019re fighting for a share of an afterthought? Or are things converging? JP: The Internet is certainly not an afterthought. If you include all the Googles and Facebooks and social platforms and tech companies\u2014 FS: In terms of total audience hours or\u2014 JP: I think in terms of revenue. Certainly in terms of market cap of the company. Facebook has a bigger market cap than the biggest media company. Google has a bigger market cap than Facebook, and if that\u2019s a vote on the future of the industry I don\u2019t think the web is going to be an afterthought. The question, though, I think you\u2019re asking, more specifically, is content companies or people creating content, news, and entertainment on the Internet. Already in terms of scale of audience, BuzzFeed reaches more people each month than MTV or Comedy Central or a lot of the big cable networks. The amount of time people spend on television is still much higher. We reach a lot of people, but they don\u2019t spend as much time on BuzzFeed as they spend watching reality shows on Bravo or something. Depending on whether you measure by time or unique audience, we\u2019re bigger by unique audience and they would be bigger by time, but I think we\u2019re seeing a crop of significant businesses that are built on the web or primarily on the web. Whether it\u2019s Vice or BuzzFeed or Vox Media or Hulu\u2014 FS: Which is an interesting one\u2014 JP: Which is a kind of hybrid kind of thing. Or Netflix. It\u2019s another one where there\u2019s starting to be companies that are in the media space that don\u2019t own cable boxes and don\u2019t own broadcast pipes and transmission towers or any of the infrastructure of the industrial media age, and that are purely or primarily in the digital space and are doing real revenue. I think you\u2019ll see that trend continue. It\u2019s hard to predict the future, but it doesn\u2019t feel to me like the space of web publishers or web content is going to just be the cheaper faster version with low rates and low margins\u2014maybe a good business, but a small business. I think we\u2019re going to get past that. At least that\u2019s what we\u2019re betting on. FS: Vice is an interesting one. Did you see Shane Smith coming out and saying he could be worth more than Twitter? JP: Yes. FS: In a way they\u2019re closest to you. They\u2019re basically a digital marketing agency, in terms of where they get their revenues. JP: Well, I think you\u2019ve seen them under the same roof in a lot of other places too. MTV did a lot of this in the early days of MTV, where they would work with brands and do integrated stuff. Meredith Publications makes a lot of branded content and has whole kitchens and facilities to make great spreads for brands. FS: Vice and BuzzFeed and Vox\u200a\u2014\u200ait seems to me that you\u2019re monetizing the paranoia of brands and of marketers who are like, \u201cOh shit, young people don\u2019t watch TV they are on their phones all the time they are on the web the whole time\u2014we don\u2019t know how to reach them.\u201d JP: It\u2019s not paranoid to think that the audience watching broadcast television is old. And it\u2019s not paranoid to think people, particularly young people, are spending a lot of time on their phones and a lot of time on the Internet. It\u2019s accurate to say that media consumption is changing in a pretty dramatic way and that if your marketing stays the same you essentially will be marketing to people who are consuming media the way people consumed media ten years ago instead of the way they\u2019re consuming today. FS: Is there anything you kick yourself about\u2014that you feel like you had the opportunity to do something and you should have done it and you didn\u2019t? JP: I think in general it\u2019s like life is tricky because it happens once and there\u2019s no opportunity for A/B testing. It could be that you are living your best possible life and that if you re-play Felix Salmon\u2019s life hundreds of other times, that this life you\u2019re living is the best or among the top 5 percent of lives that you would have lived, and in lots of other ones you\u2019d end up in an alley or in an unhappy relationship or with a job where you\u2019re not intellectually fulfilled, and that you have found this amazing path. It\u2019s also possible that you\u2019re not even in the top 50 percent of lives and that your life is really tragic and that despite all the wonderful and impressive and amazing things you\u2019ve done, that you had the potential to do all these incredible other things that would have been either bigger in scale or more fulfilling or more modest and simple, but more pleasurable or whatever. That there were all these other paths that would be better. It\u2019s, I think, hard to say whether there is something I missed that would have made things much better. In general, I\u2019m pretty happy, and all these imagined alternate lives, I wouldn\u2019t know how to even begin to speculate on how they\u2019d compare.

In three letters, GOP. Simply, it\u2019s the South\u2019s fault. The American connection to tyranny isn\u2019t new, Trump just burst the disgusting, orange \ud83c\udf4a facade. I\u2019ll call it ALT-Fascism\u2122. The talking heads, droning on for decades, inhabit the flashing screens which are always blaring in the background. The constant 40, 30, 20 second clips, attempting to grab the attention of society\u2019s unmedicated ADD. While the population was looking for its metaphorical Adderall, the NEO-Liberal descent towards tyranny, continued its omnipresent descent, stepping off the proverbial cliff, toward demagoguery. Now millions of megabits move through the internet at warp speed, the data isn\u2019t knowledge but distraction\u200a\u2014\u200adesigned to deceive, entertain, distract and influence. This is simply the description of a commercial. However, Trump\u2019s campaign wasn\u2019t just the ultimate commercial, it was Capitalist Politics, not democracy, ALT-Politik\u2122\u200a\u2014\u200aPolitical Warfare\u200a\u2014\u200aTrump is the Amped Wehrmacht of Politcs. The Trump Camp\u2019s push for an ALT-Reich\u2122 via Blitzkrieg, waged war, with weaponized information, allied with the Kremlin and its \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b, propaganda and active disinformation. This controlled chaos was always Putin\u2019s goal, no matter the extent of the conspiracy\u200a\u2014\u200aconstant manipulation of information has been the underlying theme. Don Jr. was targeted when he intentionally sought Kompromat on Clinton, Comey was obstructed because he wouldn\u2019t play the disinformation game, except when he used it to knock her down. Inverted Totalitarianism is at its core a representation of the evils of capitalism\u200a\u2014\u200aeconomics trumping (as it were) democracy. An apolitical politics\u200a\u2014\u200acost effective tyranny. The lazy dictator would rather sit back and watch the talking heads indoctrinate his Uber-Tyranny\u2122 while eating Cheetos than be out among his people purging the other. It is a philosophy of a settled democracy falling to totalitarianism without the overt destruction of the state but with the destruction of autonomy. It is oxymoronic, deontological totalitarianism or so the tyrant\u2019s PR would argue, as the individual isn\u2019t touched but society slips. Instead of Bannon\u2019s supposed Leninism, destruction of the administrative state\u200a\u2014\u200aeverything is the same except your vote doesn\u2019t count. It\u2019s as if democracy suddenly became religious, found God and surrendered to Divine Providence. Evangelical Politics\u200a\u2014\u200aborn-again into a society which seems the same but now is controlled solely by its savior. Of course, the evil of totalitarianism cannot be separated from it and as such, it is always about the tyrant and his total control of society. All polictians exhibit narcissistic traits, just jumping in the game seems to necessitate self-adulation, but it took Trump to make everyone and their micro mini-pig, an armchair psychologist. In Trump\u2019s America the TV\u2019s always on, the WIFI connected, your phone fully charged and don\u2019t forget the fascism\u200a\u2014\u200aNEO-Liberal Dystopia. Thus, the facade of democracy is always there and with it a docile population, easier to control without it knowing, its ALT-Fascist\u2122 fate\u200a\u2014\u200aeasier than controlling with drab 20th Century, fascist violence and propaganda\u200a\u2014\u200athis is 21st Century, NEO-Violence and NEO-Propaganda, in Ultra HD, (sponsored by Putin and your local GOP), where the monstrosity of Trumpian Trolls are always lurking. As Robert Kagan astutely writes, This is how fascism comes to America, not with jackboots and salutes (although there have been salutes, and a whiff of violence) but with a television huckster, a phony billionaire, a textbook egomaniac \u2018tapping into\u2019 popular resentments and insecurities, and with an entire national political party\u200a\u2014\u200aout of ambition or blind party loyalty, or simply out of fear\u200a\u2014\u200afalling into line behind him. The Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci argued that politics are led by culture, if nothing else the spectacle of one Donald John Trump has validated his point\u200a\u2014\u200aetched into the eternal collective conscious\u2019 DVR, in his reference to his fellow Republican candidates as, contestants, after an early debate.

(Esoteric may be too strong a word since BJJ is practically the foundation of the mega-sport UFC/mixed martial arts. But it\u2019s not exactly your strip mall karate studio.) If you\u2019ve never seen it, imagine wrestling with chokeholds and joint manipulation performed by two people wearing extra thick pajamas. That doesn\u2019t really do it justice. It\u2019s an addicting, awful, beautiful, brutal, captivating and crushing sport where the goal is to use leverage and technique to overcome an opponent stronger, faster, and better than you. I\u2019m pretty bad at it too. I mean, I\u2019m better than average. I\u2019ve trained for more than a decade. I\u2019m a black belt. I\u2019ve competed in a few international tournaments. But I\u2019ve never done better than winning a silver medal. But the thing that keeps coming me back is the philosophy. Every technique, every move, has an underlying philosophy or principle. Some are easier explained than others, and some people struggle to internalize for years. One of the hardest principles to comprehend is that there comes a time to give up what you have and focus on what\u2019s coming next. Let me explain. Every match begins with two people basically trying to impose their will on each other. They\u2019ll use whatever technique or position first came into their head and struggle to execute. But eventually, one person will win\u2026and many times that person isn\u2019t you (remember that silver medal?). At that point\u200a\u2014\u200aat the moment your opponent\u2019s will or technique has prevailed\u200a\u2014\u200ayou have a choice: you can fight to shove yourself and them back to where you just were or you can give up and focus on what\u2019s next. In that situation, many amateurs struggle to go back while the experts will look ahead. If you\u2019re being pinned, focus on creating the space you need to escape. If you\u2019re being thrown to the ground, focus on landing in a position where you can fight back. No amount of willpower is going to get you un-thrown. The Nobel Prize winning economist Daniel Kahneman (well, Noble Memorial Prize winning but close enough) has researched this concept extensively. He called it \u201cundoing\u201d (later published works would describe the alternative scenarios as \u201cclose counterfactuals.\u201d When people experience a setback or tragedy, their minds almost always begin to think up scenarios where a certain detail, if undone, would have prevented the setback. But undoing or dreaming up close counterfactuals is almost always a waste of brainpower. The event happened, and no amount of imagination is going to transport you back in time and allow you to change that little detail. Instead, spend your brainpower and imagination on how best to respond to the scenario you\u2019re in. In BJJ, the best thing you can do is spent the transition from one lost position to the next one thinking of how to get prepared. Life functions the same way. Resilient people aren\u2019t just more likely to be unphased by setbacks, they\u2019re also more likely to have a plan. They have a will and advance directive. They have a spare tire or AAA membership. They see the company\u2019s poor financials and start working their network to find a better job before the layoffs happen (or at least so they can be further along in the job hunting process once the layoffs arrive). It\u2019s important to imagine not just how you\u2019re going to impose your will on the world and achieve your biggest goals, but also to use that same brain to figure out how you\u2019d respond to hypothetical setbacks. Doing so can mean the difference between spending 4:59 seconds of a match pinned to the ground or finding space and escaping quickly to a new and dominant position. It can also mean the difference between finding an alternative route to your dream and ending up living a nightmare. In BJJ, you can always tap out and start again. In life, you\u2019re rarely so lucky. One of the best ways to be more resilient is to grow a network that gives you more options to respond to setbacks. I\u2019ve created a complete audiocourse on how to give and get the introductions you need to get connected and better your career. And you never have to go to a networking event again.

In a nutshell, I define a retrospective is \u2014 After a week has passed and my article is out of the publication\u2019s limelight, I run a retrospective on that piece. This simple activity has allowed me to keep front-of-mind what has and hasn\u2019t worked, allowing me to apply my learnings to future articles. Here\u2019s how I do it. After each article, I carefully read through all of the feedback I get and make notes on what was said. I say carefully here because not all feedback is relevant. Some people will leave feedback that doesn\u2019t really tell you much about why they don\u2019t agree or dislike that point. Others will leave you feedback you can use and act upon. I\u2019ve had great comments from people suggesting areas I could have used to expand my piece, areas that should have been better explained and the list goes on. For me, this also extends into my entire social network. I always take the opportunity to ask people what pieces of an article they resonate with and why. There really isn\u2019t too much magic to this point, apart from the personal feedback you get some people. Not all of these \u201csuggestions\u201d are often nice, but they\u2019re useful nonetheless. After your article\u2019s time in the light has passed, your article ends up looking like a nice heatmap. I achieve this by zooming out on my browser window to about 25%, and looking down the page at how many pieces were highlighted. Looking at how much of your article was highlighted is a great way to see if people agree with the points you\u2019ve raised. Every article brings different challenges for me. Whatever it was, I make a point of remembering what caused me grief. For me, this is one of the more important points because I hate roadblocks while I\u2019m writing. This has led me to try things such as changing my scenery, reading more, reading less, trying various writing apps and many other tips. While some haven\u2019t worked, I\u2019m glad that some of them have\u200a\u2014\u200aand helped me continue on writing. As I go through all of these steps, I write all of my findings down into a notebook. Whether you use a notebook, 4 different apps, a tablet or a computer, find what works for you. I simply use the Notes app on my iPhone that allows me to then pull them up on my Mac when writing again later. This part of the retrospective is crucial. These notes form the basis of what you look at later on when you\u2019re writing your next article, so work on finding a format or style that suits you. Mine isn\u2019t rocket science, just a title and a few notes underneath of it in bullet points. As time passes by, this stack of notes will grow and allow you to form something along the lines of a compass for you as you write. Use it to point you towards what works and away from what doesn\u2019t. Most importantly, keep adding to it! Nathan Allsopp is a Sydney-based Product Manager/Designer.

There\u2019s a fortune to be made off your distraction. Television, streaming services, movie studios, social media, apps, video games, smart phone companies, and countless other billion-dollar industries have but one goal: To make you watch their stuff. It doesn\u2019t matter if this content is actually bad for you. Doesn\u2019t matter if this graphic media makes you feel sick, depressed, sad, angry, or afraid. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s addictive or hurtful. Lower ratings only means failure for them. Best-selling author James Altucher once quipped, \u201cNinety-nine percent of TV is about scandal, murder, and cheating.\u201d He\u2019s right. And garbage in, garbage out; if you flood your mind with this toxic content, you\u2019ll begin to absorb it and see it in your life. Again, this doesn\u2019t matter to the companies selling the stuff\u200a\u2014\u200awhat matters is the money. Distractions are the enemy. Distractions destroy creativity, momentum, and focus. They seek to dominate you, much like the addiction seeks to dominate the addict. They will if you let them. If you want to cultivate a lifestyle that enables intense focus every day, where your influence is enormous and your efforts are hyper-concentrated to create incredible results\u2026 You must remove all barriers that make this possible. Here\u2019s how to eliminate all the distractions that prevent you from achieving 10x results. If you are ever distracted by: \u2026it\u2019s because you\u2019ve allowed yourself to be distracted. Your life is not unlike a business, and whether you like it or not, you are the CEO. If your business is failing, losing assets, and generally declining, it\u2019s because of you. Most people don\u2019t want this responsibility. They want to blame everything around them but themselves. The truth is, if you\u2019re distracted, it\u2019s because you\u2019ve allowed it to happen. Tony Robbins once said, \u201cWhat we tolerate is what we get.\u201d If you tolerate mediocrity, that\u2019s what you\u2019ll get. It\u2019s time to take your life back. Back from the news, your boss, the economy, your upbringing, and Donald Trump\u2019s latest tweet. Nothing else matters. Nothing can distract you. No one can derail you. But they can, if you let them. Most people can\u2019t remember the last time they entered a flow state. A flow state is when time seems to stand still as you glide through it. It\u2019s when nothing can distract you or stop you. It\u2019s how you can complete 10x the results, 10x as fast. The idea of flow has been popularized through sports, where professional athletes often describe the feeling of succeeding on the field. Gold medalists, Tour de France winners, and World Cup champions, have all repeatedly recounted how they were in flow states for their winning performances. But how can you reach this level, consistently? First, you must enter them at regular intervals, developing a rhythm. Consistently following routines creates physiological energy spikes. When you routinely make time to operate at your peak level, your peak level will become routine. This saves immense energy and attention that is typically wasted by sporadically choosing random things. I do this by waking up at the same time most mornings. I do the same routine, too: I brush my teeth, turn on the coffee, journal, read my Bible, pray, and start writing. It\u2019s automatic, and I consistently enter flow states during that writing phase. Next, you must remove emotional baggages that block your progress and mental focus. Whatever garbage and junk that has dirtied your perspective must be eliminated. One of my favorite ways of doing this is through the above-mentioned morning journaling. American playwright Julia Cameron once said morning journaling is like \u201cspiritual windshield wipers.\u201d I can easily remove distracting emotional baggage and focus on my task at hand. Perhaps one of the most well-known ancient maxims is the Greek phrase: \u201cKnow thyself.\u201d It is only through mastering your own system\u200a\u2014\u200ayour emotions, your thoughts, your brain, your desires, your weaknesses\u200a\u2014\u200athat you become the master of your soul. Once you do this, distractions fade away. Entering flow states becomes easier and easier. Most people don\u2019t reinvest their free time. Most people don\u2019t exercise, read books, or spend meaningful time with loved ones. That means if you went for a jog today and read for just 10 minutes, you\u2019re already way ahead of the curve! The world\u2019s most successful people invest their free time. In the words of prolific writer Nicolas Cole: Scott Adams, creator of the wildly successful Dilbert comics, once said, \u201cEvery skill you acquire doubles your odds of success.\u201d Robert Kiyosaki, author of the famous Rich Dad Poor Dad books, teaches that the world\u2019s wealthiest people were simply the ones who continually reinvested their profits into more assets. If you want to be successful, and focus your efforts to achieve greatness in the most important areas of your life, it\u2019s fair to ask yourself: Is excessive consumption of social media, the news, television, and video games preventing you from being successful? I recently had to take a hiatus from the NBA. I\u2019ve allowed myself to watch my team\u2019s highlights, but that\u2019s it. No more reading about the latest gossip with LeBron. No more checking the latest trades within 2 minutes of waking up. No more daily status updates of players I don\u2019t even care about. It had become destructive behavior, and my success was beginning to wane. I was wasting away hours a day I could have spent on reading, improving, and learning. It simply wasn\u2019t, and isn\u2019t, worth it. I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t have any free time where you relax. But most people are bad at using their free time wisely, and often waste it. Many people claim they want to be successful, but do they really? If you claim to value something, but your behavior shows the opposite, then you actually don\u2019t have that value. Not really. Most things are unimportant. Most things, frankly, don\u2019t deserve our full attention and focus. What I define as \u201cimportant\u201d is simple: does it contribute to expanding your life? Does it directly build your legacy and life\u2019s calling? Does it give you life and fulfillment? When it comes down to it, the most important things for me are Jesus, family, my health, and my work. Everything else simply comes second. Of course, anything can be construed to fit these requirements; email is \u201cessential.\u201d Working overtime is nonnegotiable. Watching that TV show is a \u201cmust-see.\u201d You \u201ccan\u2019t miss\u201d going out for drinks again. But when you really, truly analyze these \u201cessential\u201d and \u201ccrucial\u201d obligations, you realize they have virtually no impact on your future. They don\u2019t expand your life. They don\u2019t contribute to your legacy. The more you understand this, the better equipped you are to produce truly phenomenal work. What \u201cessential\u201d things do you need to give up? What do you need to start ignoring? How can you spend that time better? Why haven\u2019t you started these things yet? For me, I check my email twice a day (sometimes once. Sometimes zero! I like those days). I also never check it unless I\u2019m able to respond immediately. I ignore social media like the plague. I can\u2019t stand it. My wife laughs at my distaste for it, but all I see is a bunch of ads, clickbait, and mindless entertainment that leaves me feeling empty and sad. Your ability to ignore irrelevance is just as important as your ability to focus on priorities. If you want to eliminate distractions and cultivate a lifestyle that enables daily hyper-focus, you must do what others are unwilling to do. You must unapologetically categorize everything into two categories: important, and unimportant. If you allow mediocrity into your life, your life will become mediocre. Remember, what we tolerate is what we get. Author Darren Hardy once wrote: \u201cSuccessful people do what unsuccessful people are unwilling to do.\u201d If you want a life no one else has, you must do what no one else does. Eliminate distractions. Develop routines and rhythms that enable hyper-focus. Don\u2019t settle for what is merely good; sacrifice good for what is great.

Now, bogged down with the insoluble problems of fake news and bad PR, it\u2019s clear that Facebook will gradually pull the plug on news. Publishers should stop whining and move on. Let\u2019s admit that publishers have been screwed by Facebook. Not because Mark Zuckerberg is evil, but because he\u2019s a pragmatist. His latest move should not come as a surprise. On Thursday, for the second time in six months, Facebook stated publicly that news (i.e., journalism) will appear further down in everyone\u2019s newsfeed, in order to favor posts from friends, family and \u201cgroups.\u201d Here is how Zuck defended the move: \u201cThe research shows that when we use social media to connect with people we care about, it can be good for our well-being. We can feel more connected and less lonely, and that correlates with long term measures of happiness and health. On the other hand, passively reading articles or watching videos\u200a\u2014\u200aeven if they\u2019re entertaining or informative\u200a\u2014\u200amay not be as good. Based on this, we\u2019re making a major change to how we build Facebook. I\u2019m changing the goal I give our product teams from focusing on helping you find relevant content to helping you have more meaningful social interactions\u201d. Consider us notified. Facebook is done with journalism. It will happen, slowly, gradually, but the trend is here. In this context, the email sent yesterday by Campbell Brown, Facebook\u2019s head of news partnerships, who states \u201cnews remains a top priority for us,\u201d rings hollow. Viewed from its perspective, Facebook has all the reasons in the world to get rid of journalism: \u2022 As acknowledged several times by Mark Zuckerberg, news doesn\u2019t share well, compared to friends and family posts, while the entire Facebook model is based on the speed of sharing, multiplied by its two billion users, and coupled to an unparalleled knowledge of each one. \u2022 Maintaining a large newsfeed presence of information could become expensive for Facebook. A few weeks ago, Mark Zuckerberg hinted that profits might be affected by the cost of hiring thousands of human moderators to fight misinformation. It is unclear whether FB will forgo this idea (most likely, it will hire some of them\u2026) \u2022 News has turned into a PR nightmare for Facebook. Fires erupted constantly, and they were hard to contain, as with the outrage triggered by the deletion of the Napalm Girl photograph from the Norwegian daily Aftenposten, to name just one incident. \u2022 Most of the time, news is inherently dark, and Facebook wants to promote a positive view of society, fearing that gloom translates into disaffection. (This idea is highly disputable: Netflix original creations, for instance, are filled with scores of grim series that viewers love.) The cost of managing streams of information, developing & maintaining products, and dealing with publishers\u200a\u2014\u200acompared to the revenue, is not worth the effort. Switching to entertainment will translate into more money for much less risk. \u2022 Dealing with media companies is especially complicated. Three constant features characterize publishers: a deep sense of entitlement (\u201cWe are the news, you owe this and that to us\u201d), a lack of technical competence (they expect FB to come up with ready-to-use products), and, in Europe, a propensity to call on Daddy (the government) and Mommy (Brussels) when things go awry. The list could go on. I always thought that if I were Zuckerberg, given the hassles, I would have, slowly but surely, retreated from news. That is exactly what\u2019s happening. Facebook, for its part, made a solid collection of mistakes in dealing with news media. Some honest, others\u2026less honest. Facebook can\u2019t help but consider the ROW as a giant test bed for its ideas. (ROW refers to Rest Of the World, i.e., countries outside the United States and more precisely, the world beyond Building N\u00b010 in Menlo Park, California). Even if this is more a result of the ingrained insular culture of Silicon Valley than sheer cynicism, the consequences have been negative. In the search for the right business model, Facebook lured the media industry with a flurry of novelties. Driven by a mixture of na\u00efvet\u00e9, herd mentality, Fear Of Missing Out (Fomo), and a burning desire to monetize journalism, publishers jumped on every bone Facebook threw at them, hoping for the magic infusion they were no longer able to find on their own. Facebook came up with glowing new products like Newsfeed, Instant Articles, and Facebook Live, providing silly advice for thriving on the platform (\u201cPlay on emotion, folks, users love it!\u200a\u2014\u200aHem, this might be difficult, we are business news providers\u2026\u201d). Facebook promised a deluge of eyeballs. Caught in the headlights, deer-like publishers silenced their mental warning that said to look deeper, and gave up loads of content in exchange for nearly nothing. After investing significantly in dedicated teams to produce, promote, and strategize their presence on Facebook, publishers of editorial quality were left with hemorrhaging viewerships and a trickle of revenue. (A group of profusely funded media innovators like BuzzFeed, Vice and others \u2014who cleverly designed their products to blend neatly into Facebook\u2014started out doing well, but now face disappointment). Those who imagined Las Vegas, now find themselves stuck in Detroit. First, it killed the notion of brand. Year after year, the percentage of people able to recall where they got their news, is dwindling. \u201cI read it on Facebook\u201d now applies to half the population of the United States and Europe, and much more in countries where Facebook embodies the Internet. Second, the notion of authorship has also vanished. Almost nobody has a clue who wrote what. Gradually, the two pillars of the trusting relationship between the media and its customers eroded, before crumbling altogether. Facebook has flattened the news for good. Third, Facebook annihilated the business model of news by opening the way to a massive, ultra-cheap and ultra-targeted advertising system that brings next to nothing to the publishers. The reality of Facebook\u2019s revenue stream is harsh: a European publisher told me last week that its RPM (Revenue per thousands) for videos on Facebook was about 30 cents of a Euro (that is 37 cents on a dollar). A pittance. Zuckerberg\u2019s last message has the merit of clarity. It says: \u201cSorry guys, it didn\u2019t work as expected, go somewhere else or face a slow but inexorable extinction in our ecosystem. Nothing personal, here. Just business.\u201d Even the timing of the announcement was not left to chance. On January 31, Facebook will release its financial results for the fiscal year 2017. Analysts are unanimously forecasting spectacular growth. (In passing, it will erase Friday\u2019s 4.5% drop in FB\u2019s stock that followed the announcement on the newsfeed overhaul): Once the acute pain is gone, the industry will realize that this is not such bad news after all. It is time to regroup and refocus on the basics. It will eventually mean disbanding or repurposing the teams assembled to deal with Facebook production requirements. First, Facebook remains a formidable field to reach non-core audiences and do all sorts of marketing tests, thanks to its exceptional ability to pinpoint any group, and its incredible reach. Second, all the resources that were diverted to feed the Facebook machine, can be focused on developing news products that directly impact the company\u2019s activity\u200a\u2014\u200afinding, retaining and converting loyal readers\u200a\u2014\u200aas opposed to pursuing elusive cohorts who can\u2019t remember the name of the news brand. The quest for quality readership will prevail over the mirage of a mass audience once promised by Facebook. One final thought (for now). On Friday, Adam Mosseri, Facebook\u2019s newsfeed chief, said to Wired: \u201cThere will also be more group content. Group content tends to inspire a lot of conversation. Communities on Facebook are becoming increasingly active and vibrant.\u201d This vision could backfire terribly: an increase in the weight of \u201cgroups\u201d means reinforcement of Facebook\u2019s worst features\u200a\u2014\u200acognitive bubbles\u200a\u2014\u200awhere users are kept in silos fueled by a torrent of fake news and extremism. \u2014 frederic.filloux@mondaynote.com By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

No one got into a new relationship that lasted longer than a few months, but several people got out of old ones (including one divorce) that had been going on a long time. Could have been the work hours, could have been the stress, not sure. One day, when my work lightened up for half an hour or so and I had a minute to think\u200a\u2014\u200aI thought, this is it. This is what I\u2019m giving up relationships for. This is what I\u2019m giving up children for, this right here. And it was a horrible thing to realize, because I was miserable. Instead of pursuing things that might have made me happy and improved my life in deeply meaningful ways, I had decided to work long hours at a job that I hated. How did I get there? It took about another 6 months, but I did quit that job eventually. Then about a year after I left, they went out of business, and that year of hard, miserable work was absorbed back into the aether. (Pro tip for startups: if you make your working conditions miserable, only people who don\u2019t think they can get a better job will stay in the long term. And your top engineering talent is probably being recruited all the time, so they won\u2019t think that.) But, startups aren\u2019t the interesting part of this. The interesting part is, why did I spend so long giving up things I loved to keep working a job I hated? And, we can say options! or big payout! and that was part of it, for sure. I was hoping for the big payout. But it went deeper than that; I believed my worth was connected with how much I produced. I believed that being an engineer made me valuable in a way that being someone\u2019s girlfriend or being a mother wouldn\u2019t. Suffice it to say, I now believe I was deeply misguided, but it\u2019s what I thought. Part of me believed I was \u201cbetter\u201d than women who were \u201cjust\u201d homemakers or moms, and I lost a decade of my life to that belief. And I\u2019m not the only one. How do we motivate people to do miserable things they don\u2019t want to do? How do we convince people to pour decades of their work into things that are not helping them achieve the goals that would bring them deep happiness? We tell them that they\u2019re better in some non-definable way. We humiliate people who don\u2019t play by the rules, aka, people who don\u2019t earn enough money. Money has become more than just having the means for life; it has become a way of demonstrating your superiority to those around you. This is why people with millions of dollars work their ass off to make millions more; not because they need more things, but because they think twice as much money will make them twice as good. Twice as valuable. Then, once they\u2019re \u201cgood\u201d enough, it\u2019s presumed that everything will fall into place\u200a\u2014\u200amarriage, children, etc. Except, it\u2019s a bit of a lie. If you have kids at 45 vs 25, that\u2019s 20 years of time you don\u2019t get to spend with your children. If you kids copy your example, that\u2019s 40 years you don\u2019t get to spend with your grandchildren, which could easily be the difference between ever meeting them or not. This realization hit me a bit earlier than it tends to hit men because, absent invasive technology, I probably can\u2019t have kids at 45. For me, it becomes about even being able to have kids at all. And I know I exist in an extreme area of society, aka the tech sector, but it\u2019s also an area that\u2019s rapidly expanding. It\u2019s an area that has a shit ton of money in a time when people need money, so I expect these forces will intensify over time. The book 1984 (shot from the movie at the top) imagined a world where people would be indentured to government mind control, but in the US, it seems to have happened with corporate mind control. In 1984, the government convinces its citizens to believe things are their exact opposite: \u201cWar is Peace\u201d, \u201cSlavery is Freedom\u201d, and \u201cIgnorance is Strength\u201d are the three slogans of the controlling party. Slavery is Freedom especially rings true for me in the tech world. Somehow, people working 70 hour weeks and sacrificing their happiness and personal life for the goals of their employers believe they are free. They believe they are the luckiest people in the USA, because they have the most money, and not because they need the money, but because they feel like having money increases their innate worth. If I was going to rewrite the slogans for the tech industry, I might come up with this: Slavery is Freedom. Money is Virtue. Suffering is Joy. That last one came up because, not only was I expected to put in 70 hour weeks at the office, I was expected to enjoy it. I was regularly taken to task for having a bad attitude; I was even fired over it once (and, from then after, I learned how to pretend to be having a good time with mixed results.) My fellow workers would regularly not use all their vacation time, and when questioned on it at the office, they\u2019d say things like \u201cthere\u2019s not really anything else I\u2019d rather be doing. If I took time off of work, I\u2019d just be bored.\u201d THIS IS THE BEST GUYS! ISN\u2019T WORKING HERE THE BEST!? THIS IS LITERALLY THE PEAK OF HUMAN EXISTENCE. IT\u2019S LIKE I\u2019M HAVING TEN THOUSAND SIMULTANEOUS ORGASMS RIGHT NOW! I\u2019m probably too honest for my own good, but instead of agreeing, I was like \u201cwhat!? Are you guys joking? I can think of a thousand places I\u2019d rather be than here.\u201d I mean, how do people even say they have nowhere better to be than work with a straight face? You could be fucking, you could doing coke of a stripper (male stripper, cuz I\u2019m a feminist,) you could be dancing. You could be going for a walk in the park, or doing yoga, or getting a massage. Or, you could *literally* be doing nothing, because doing what you\u2019re told all day isn\u2019t actually fun, it is actually *less fun* than not doing anything. But, most of us spend so long doing what other people tell us to do ALL DAY EVERY DAY that we forget that. If you can\u2019t think of something to do with your vacation, at least take it to sit at home and watch TV. But, most people feel guilty when they do that, so it ruins it for them. The voice of the authoritative \u201cother\u201d has been planted in our head, and thats ultimately what controls us. That is the point of school, by the way, and education. It\u2019s less about imparting knowledge, and more about filling your head with societal doctrine so you will produce for your employer without seeing through the bullshit of the system (if you want to read the specifics about how this is done, I recommend the book Disciplined Minds by Jeff Schmidt.) It\u2019s where the guilt of non-productivity comes from. It\u2019s where the delusion that your value is what you produce, as measured by money comes from. But it\u2019s lies, all lies, that they put inside us so we\u2019ll work for them. It\u2019s lies they put inside us so we won\u2019t find creative solutions that will help us achieve the goals we personally want. We become brainwashed to believe that the goals that our superiors want are the goals we want for ourselves so that we wouldn\u2019t even know how to start if we wanted to improve our personal lives. And, I think marriage is the canary in the coal mine. Fewer people are getting married than ever before, and there are a bunch of divorces, and etc. I personally don\u2019t really believe in marriage, so I never really had a problem with that, but I think that most Americans do believe in marriage. I think most Americans want to get married, and they don\u2019t want their marriages to end in divorce. This trend toward less productive marriages, I believe, is indicative of a cultural shift where people are less able to get what they want in their personal lives because of the demands of their professional lives. Most of the male engineers I\u2019ve worked with, for instance, tended toward being single because they worked too long to date. And, even if they did date, sometimes they came across as \u201cweird\u201d because they had cultivated a social self that was suited towards being an ideal employee and not an ideal mate. Or, on the other hand, a small subset did seem to become obsessed with having casual relationships with as many people as possible (this Vanity Fair piece on Silicon Valley sex parties kind of rang true for me) but not bonding with any one person (or more) in a way that would create obligations that might distract from their work life. This trend towards the \u201cself\u201d developing as an \u201cideal employee\u201d intensifies over your life as work becomes the major social force for a grownup. And, if you think about it, the ideal employee wouldn\u2019t have a personal life. The ideal employee is probably a single, childfree workaholic and *what do you know* that\u2019s exactly the type of person our society is producing more and more of. Ideally, they wouldn\u2019t have too many distracting friends either, hey, check it out\u200a\u2014\u200athe number of close friends people have is shrinking over time. The decline in marriage is, I believe, both a symptom of this, but also a cause of its acceleration. As an analogy, consider the global ice caps. They are melting because of global warming, but as they melt, the reflective white ice and snow is replaced with darker rocks and vegetation, and more sunlight is absorbed. So, their melting also contributes to global warming, making them both a symptom and cause of global warming. (If this depresses you, scientists have found ways of re-freezing some of the ice, but it would not offset other aspects of global warming.) But anyway; similarly, I view declining marriage to be both a symptom and a cause of corporate mind control. The book The Guru Papers: Masks of Authoritarian Power examines the methods that modern spiritual organizations\u200a\u2014\u200alike religion, cults, and gurus\u200a\u2014\u200aexert authoritarian control over their followers. In particular, how \u201cgurus\u201d tend to ensure the emotional fidelity of their followers seemed particularly relevant to modern tech life: The Guru Papers: Masks of Authoritarian Power (p. 92) By preventing deep emotional bonding with other humans, gurus make sure that followers get their emotional needs met from the guru himself, or the associated cult. Similarly, by preventing their employees from bonding deeply with people outside the company (I suspect this is implicit, btw, not that the people in power consciously try to create these conditions) companies ensure that their employees wellbeing is wrapped up with staying at the company. An emotional dependence as well as a financial dependence ensues. However, for obvious reasons, there are many emotional needs a person may have that a corporation is not suited to meet. This emotional dependence is all the more intense given we are living in a time of community breakdown, either through gentrification in the cities or ghost towns in more rural areas. The only consistent support structure a person is likely to find nowadays is their employer and this support will depend on their employability. While community, and spouses, do tend to cramp down on people\u2019s emotional freedom, a large employer is likely worse for your freedom than either. This is because, often the people making decisions about your wellbeing do not have to interact with you in person. They do not have to witness your sadness, or have any knowledge of your personal goals, so the constraints of exploitation normally imposed by human sentimentality break down. Your employer is free to demand what it wants from you, absent any mitigating checks and balances. So, to maintain the emotional support provided by your company, you are likely to have to work harder at less pleasant tasks than you would to get support from your spouse or community, because bearing witness to your suffering is something your employer will not do. We think of ourselves as living in a time of great freedom, and when it comes to things like information and mobility, I agree we have great freedom. However, when it comes to the freedom for an individual to \u201cspend each day pursing the tasks they\u2019d like to pursue,\u201d I\u2019d argue we live in a time of less freedom than ever before. We live in a time where people tend to be underemployed and constantly worried about money, or over-employed with very little personal time. (Read about the leisure time paradox in the US right now.) It is difficult to hit a balance, and indeed, we are encouraged not to. To break out of this cycle, we will need to get our emotional needs met outside of our work lives. A spouse could provide that, but it\u2019s not the only option. For me personally, I think that the emotional support I got from the Zen center, and my Zen teacher specifically, gave me a lot of what I needed to start building a happier life for myself. And, I haven\u2019t got it all figured out, but I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not staring down another decade of workaholism. I don\u2019t have nearly as much money as I used to, but a giant cloud of misery has been lifted from my life. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

You\u2019re staring out of the window of a coffee bar in a snowy and dark Stockholm. It has been an amazing year. Your company is acquiring customers faster than ever and you\u2019re launching in more and more countries. However, Google and Apple are catching up. It\u2019s not a question if they will launch their own music streaming services, but when. To survive that eventuality Spotify must become a truly global player. You have to do this while still figuring out how the music streaming business actually works. What do customers really want? What will they pay for? What do you need to do to convince someone to stop buying CDs or MP3s and instead be willing to pay for a monthly streaming subscription? To do all this on a global scale you have to grow your engineering team. It has been a huge challenge to grow your team from 10 to 100 in the last year. Some people predict you might even need to attract another 1,000 engineers to pull this off. You feel overwhelmed. How can you attract the right talent with the right mindset across the entire globe? Managing a team of 100 is already complicated. But if you grow even further, how do you stay agile? How can you keep the start-up culture that has brought success so far and prevent becoming a lumbering bureaucracy? Another two years have passed and the company now has 15 million customers. The engineering team has tripled in size to 300 people. A challenge that has been top of mind for a while now is, \u201cWith 30 teams, how do we make sure we build a castle that makes sense to the customer, instead of a pile of 30 bricks that nobody likes?\u201d The teams have started to experiment with a scaling model that uses Squads, Chapters, Guilds and Tribes who aim to implement \u2018minimum viable bureaucracy\u2019 and balance high autonomy with high alignment. This structure is just one piece of the puzzle, though. Through a few workshops, the agile coaches came up with a set of organizational design principles with the autonomous team as the core concept. This extension of the agile manifesto is called \u201cAgile \u00e0 la Spotify\u201d, and has been printed on the walls across the office: Fast forward to early 2018. Spotify has 140 million subscribers in 61 countries. It has announced an IPO at a $20 billion valuation. Engineering is now 150 teams and 700 people. In total, Spotify employs over 2,500 people: the organization is no longer a startup, it\u2019s a global enterprise. A lot has gone really well. The culture is known for a high level of empowerment and trust, a focus on personal development, and is known for its sense of purpose. Teams are fully empowered to fulfill their mission and have the freedom to act independently. But as Joakim Sund\u00e9n pointed out, it is far from an agile nirvana. Managing 150 autonomous teams can feel like herding cats, especially when it comes to projects that span across teams. Some recent examples: implementing SOX compliance to enable the IPO, keeping up with new privacy laws and moving all infrastructure into the Google Cloud. Also, the lack of focus on architecture and technical standards has made it challenging to scale the platform to support its growing user base. Implementing these initiatives top-down wouldn\u2019t work in Spotify\u2019s culture. A team can simply say \u201cI don\u2019t want to do it\u201d and would need to be seduced to give these priority. Over the years, the lack of central planning and standardization has enabled hyper-speed, hyper-growth and hyper-innovation. But it has made certain things a lot harder that are easy for more traditional organizations. Time will tell how Spotify will continue to evolve. It\u2019s a challenging balancing act between doing the right things, doing the things right and doing things fast. As agile organization designers, we\u2019ve been following Spotify closely. Over the years, we\u2019ve visited their offices several times. It\u2019s an awesome company and there is much to learn from them. We love how the engineering culture videos have inspired thousands of people to start upgrading their organizations. However, if you\u2019re considering implementing the \u2018Spotify model\u2019, please think again. Is your organization building a music player? Is your organization still trying figure out its business model? Is your organization facing hyper-growth? Is \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d applicable to your product?\u201d Maybe. But, probably not. When people copy the \u2018Spotify model\u2019, it often happens through a top-down directive, without taking a close look at what kind of culture and leadership is needed to make it work. Often the existing hierarchy is changed into a new, static matrix blueprint (even if the matrix is labeled with Squads, Chapters, and Tribes), instead of growing a culture of continuous participatory change. This will inevitably make things worse. Even people who work at Spotify recommend to not copy their model. Don\u2019t get us wrong: in order to enable agility in an organization, we do recommend that you move away from top-down management and focus on empowering capable teams. But to copy a pre-existing model and believe that your problems will also be solved, is short-sighted and naive. Just as startups are focused on finding product-market fit, we believe you should start on a journey to find your organization-context fit. Spotify has been able to do both. We love this quote that is at the heart of what we believe: So what can you do if you want to gain agility, speed and innovation? Where to begin? First, ask yourself, is there a clear picture of what issues you\u2019re trying to solve with a new organizational model? If possible, find a few measurable indicators of what needs to be improved. Involve not only your leadership team, but also a wide variety of people in the organization to gather ideas and co-create a picture of the desired future state. A good question to ask is: what is holding you back from doing the best work of your lives? Don\u2019t forget to appreciate what is going really well and decide what you definitely want to keep. Take inspiration from a wide variety of future of work practices and companies. Look at different models of self-organization that fit different scale and risk contexts. Look beyond Spotify and even look beyond agile to gain org-wide agility. Figure out what the main capabilities are you need to upgrade and where in the organization they are rooted. The OS Canvas is a useful tool for this exercise. Design and start a number of pilots that help you try out new ways of working and allows you to quickly learn if it fits your specific context. Expand the pilots that show promise. End the ones that don\u2019t produce the effect you\u2019re looking for. Build your organization\u2019s ability to constantly try new behaviors and learning from those experiments. At the end of the day, use the Spotify model as an inspiration for what\u2019s possible when you spend time and attention developing your own operating system\u200a\u2014\u200anot as a model for what your own system may end up looking like. Design, test, and evolve your own model as inclusively as possible. Don\u2019t do a big-bang change towards a new static target operating model, but instead build the muscle for continuous participatory change. Don\u2019t \u201cdo the Spotify model\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ado your model. Co-authored by a friend of The Ready: Roy Gielen (Agile enabler, trainer & coach at Ctree) Ready to change how you work?

We\u2019ve known each other for nearly a decade and he\u2019s been a friend, a co-investor in startups and a mentor to many startups with whom I\u2019ve worked. As you can imagine, when you introduce tech professionals or VCs to a grammy-award winning rap artist they start with pre-conceived ideas but of course that \u201cpattern matching\u201d is what leads our industry to underestimate people. Cham is generationally talented and his insights about what make audiences tick has led him to be a valued investor and mentor at companies like Maker Studios and Cruise (acquired for $700 million and $1 billion respectively). So of course when Cham wanted to build his own startup I was first in line asking to fund him. In creating Convoz, I have watched Cham literally dissect every screen interaction, UX navigation, social integration, etc. He has embodied the typical founder journey you would expect from any dropout kid from Stanford or Harvard. I would put him high on the list of startup founders who have a deep knowledge of the users they serve, what is unique about their app and how to build a product for scale. Along with his co-founder Nsilo Reddick they have been active users in their app and have embodied what is truly unique about Convoz. In a world in which influencers are tired of people trolled on social platforms and everyday users are tired of superficial social promotion, he is built a video application in which real people can have asynchronous conversations that matter and are curated to avoid trolls. If chameleon is a metaphor for somebody who can cross over and fit in with any environment in which they inhabit then choosing the public name Chamillionaire was a stroke of genius because the man that I know well is a cross-over genius who has mastered both worlds. I don\u2019t really want to tell you about his presentation because it was such a masterpiece, so profound & insightful that I\u2019d urge you just to watch it yourself. I promise you insights, entertainment, emotion, thoughtful challenges and a bit of celebrity guest appearances\u00a0:) TED\u200a\u2014\u200aeat your heart out. Next up for Cham? He will have to prove that he can hit the fund-raising trail as hard as he\u2019s hit the product development phase of Convoz and if history is any lesson for me, I predict continued success.

What is the right path anyway? You're supposed to set a long-term development plan for your company or a product, with very limited information about what the future holds. This is what I call high-risk low-data decisions. The most important thing in this situation is to avoid and overcome analysis paralysis. I've been there more often than I would like to remember, so I wanted to share one of the techniques I've used. Since roadmap is a long-term plan, it can hold a lot of features in its list. This makes it hard to compare one to another and decide which is more important and which brings more value. This is why I like to make it visual. It's easier to understand if I can see it. During the roadmap planning sessions, I always ask myself these questions: I have to know the price, at least in some fictional currency. I have to know the effort required for developing this feature. This will give me a perspective of how big or how small the feature is. Since I'm investing time and money in development, I have to estimate the returns. Will it make me better than my competition, or will it bring me competitive parity? Do I have an existing customer for this specific feature? If not, do I see somebody using it? It is important to visualize how are you empowering your users and how your feature adds value to their business. Make your users awesome. If there is an existing market, will it still be there in a month or a year? Will it grow or is it just a hype? I have to try to predict the future, since I'm building a product for the time yet to come. You probably recognized the pairs in the questions above: Put your roadmap items in a table, and assign each item with a rank for effort, value, market share and market growth. Ranks can be on a scale from 0 to 100, and you can choose yours depending on the resolution you want to get. But important thing is that the ranks are relative to each roadmap item because the goal here is to compare them and decide which are more important and which ones bring more value. Now that you've assigned the ranks, try plotting the scatter in two two-dimensional charts. Things will start making sense once you see your diagram\u2026 When you look at the chart, you can immediately spot four distinct areas: These features/products are the ones that everybody likes building. You don't have to bust your ass, and the users are delighted with it. You should definitely focus on these because the return of investment is very high. Grab the low hanging fruit, and save your energy for the following\u2026 This is the area that gets you excited and you look forward to making these things happen. This quadrant will be filled with the things you believe in, the things that define your product or service. Sure, they require a lot of attention, work and energy, but boy oh boy, do they shine when finished. This should be your main focus, even if you have to take some risks. These are less attractive features. Nevertheless, you shouldn't throw them away, since their value is usually slightly bigger than the effort required. Features within this quadrant will most likely give you competitive parity. It's unlikely that anyone will be mesmerized when they see them, but it's likely that absence of these features will be noticed (things that we're used to having in all other products). You can pimp up the value for these features by assigning them to junior members of your team. They will feel in charge, learn something new and feel accomplished and independent. Keep away from these. These will suck out your energy and you will fail to recharge since their value is so small compared to the others. This is the investment you wouldn't want to make. Maybe at some point, it seemed like a pretty cool idea, but there is a reason why you've ranked it so low. It's either intuition or data, but trust your guts and postpone these 'nice-to-haves'. This chart is supposed to be a reality check. Are you actually building something that people want, or it's just your pet project because you like it. Features in this area are on point. They are targeting your existing customers and accounts. This means that people like what you're about to build. Also, there is a potential for customer base growth, since you can see more and more people get into it. This is the area with the highest perspective since you are building things that your existing clients love, with the possibility to expand on clients similar to the ones you have. These features are cool too. Low growth doesn't necessarily need to be a bad thing. This might mean that you are targeting well-established group of people, with the specific needs and preferences. Since the share is high, you know that the need for this exists, and you won't be wasting your time. This is your gold mine. Or a coal mine. One never knows. Since the growth is high, you might just hit the jackpot with these features. The outcome is blurry, but the opportunity is definitely there. If they are also low effort\u200a\u2014\u200ahigh value items, you should start building these immediately. These are your pet projects. Admit it. Nobody seems to be interested in these, but yet you've put them in your roadmap. Pet projects can sometimes grow into something big, but if your backlog is already full, focus on things with brighter future. Now, take a look at the two charts you just created. If you can identify items which are within high value\u200a\u2014\u200alow effort and high share\u200a\u2014\u200ahigh growth regions, pin these items on the top of your roadmap. Start building them first and invest in them. On the other hand, if there are items within low value\u200a\u2014\u200ahigh effort and low share\u200a\u2014\u200alow growth region, just discard those items. Or keep them at the very bottom of your list if you got emotionally attached to your pets. I hope you'll find this helpful. As I said, I like to plot these charts so that I can visually detect what is hot and what is not. You can also use these charts to show your plan to the investors, shareholders, team members, anyone interested in your roadmap. If you're still in doubt about what needs to be built, just make the decision. Use this technique or just go with your intuition. Just make the decision and the hard work you put in will make it the right one. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

In today\u2019s sophisticated and scientific world such advice seems heresy and peculiar however, it is quite possibly the most important piece of information you\u2019re ever likely to hear. The hero\u2019s journey, as told by Campbell, is answering the call for adventure. Everybody at some stage in their life feels a calling for adventure. This call is something one feels. It is not something which will present itself with written information and facts that will convince you to undertake the endeavor. Instead, it will be a strange sensation within you, guiding you towards a particular decision. This chosen decision is often illogical, it may even be unthinkable, but no matter how easy it is to think yourself away from the calling, it will still be within you. It takes courage to come out of your mind and into your body. Education in Britain teaches children what to think and not how to think. Consequently, people\u2019s minds have become overstimulated with information and opinions which do not belong to them. This information is cold and lifeless and cannot produce the creativity we desire. Because it is by sensations with which we experience the world, the body, warm and alive, should be our guiding light in deciding our actions. The majority of people never answer the call for adventure. It is too difficult, too daunting, too uncomfortable. These people will go onto build different lives from the one that was chosen for them. Perhaps they will become wealthy and fill positions of significance. But, Campbell argues that you can never be at peace with yourself if you do not answer the call for adventure. Instead, he states you can only build up resentment in the knowledge that you missed the opportunity to pursue your purpose. You live life only ever able to create new problems for yourself. For most people their purpose will not be to change the world in one way or another. It will be whatever the fire within directs them towards. Whether that be to become a builder, a painter or a bank clerk, the heart will guide everyone to whatever they are supposed to be. It is not for society to judge a man\u2019s journey but, rather, it is for the man himself to be fulfilled in the knowledge that he has become the man he was supposed to be. The hero\u2019s journey is an interesting concept. The cycle of the journey has been used in popular culture as a framework for many books and movies. It is well known that George Lucas based his Star Wars series from Campbell\u2019s book. This is because the hero\u2019s journey makes for special and fascinating stories. The joys and the struggles that the hero must be through are unique to the individual. No two hearts are the same and thus, no two journeys are the same. By following someone else\u2019s advice, you also follow their footsteps, denying yourself the chance to put your foot forward and create your own path. Campbell states that living life knowing you have been faithful to yourself is the only way to be truly at peace. Follow me @harrystead17 on Twitter.

We were following along on Twitter, and we ended up sitting for more than two hours, in shock, in one of those in-store display lounge rooms watching it all unfold. It was surreal. No-one on my Twitter feed was cheering. No-one on Facebook either. I wasn\u2019t aware of a single person I knew who was happy with the result. How disconnected from the other half of the world had I become? In the wake of Trump\u2019s victory, I started to try and construct an intellectually defensible reason why someone would, thoughtfully and consciously, vote for Trump. I needed to seek out a wider range of views and perspectives than the ones I was reinforcing to myself through my Facebook friends and Twitter follows. My starting point was Peter Thiel\u2019s Press Club address from October 2016. Thiel\u2019s \u2018Zero To One\u2019 was full of original thinking. Through listening to Sam Harris\u2019 podcast interview with Eric Weinstein, Thiel Capital\u2019s Managing Director, I got the sense that any view Thiel lands on had been meaningfully stress-tested. Pulling apart Thiel\u2019s Press Club address allowed me to cobble together a more considered pro-Trump picture. Here\u2019s what that picture looks like. 1. America is in bad condition. 2. There is a prosperity divide that the prosperous aren\u2019t acknowledging. 3. America should not be fighting foreign wars. 4. Free trade is hurting America. 5. Government still has a job to do in fixing these problems. 6. Trump is the answer because\u2026 Any country where most over-55s have less than a year\u2019s worth of savings, healthcare costs are absurd, there is a student debt crisis, Millennials expect their own lives to be worse than the lives of their parents and the median household makes less money than it did 17 years ago clearly has problems. The available surface area for the argument with Thiel then is: And then, depending on your answers to those questions, you can decide which candidate you believe is better positioned to lead the free world? That\u2019s the political argument to have. But we\u2019re in a time of such polarisation, such sensationalism, such breathless, red-faced finger pointing, those aren\u2019t the political arguments we\u2019re having. I think a lot of people feel the way I do. Confused by people on both sides of the debate. Excluded from the conversation. A long way from constructive discussion, or any meaningful, objective analysis of the problems we\u2019re facing. What was the last good suggestion you heard for addressing the wealth divide? What was the last great article you read about the right way to manage a trade deficit? Who do you trust to provide a path forward on how those five foreign wars should be managed by the US? Do you feel there\u2019s someone making constructive progress on the high cost of healthcare or the student debt crisis or stagnating wage growth? I can\u2019t. Into that vacuum of constructive debate and objective analysis, a new generation of public intellectuals is emerging. They are taking the baton once held by the likes of Christopher Hitchens, Peter Singer and Richard Dawkins. While they still all use books as their primary currency, they\u2019re also fully leveraging podcasts, Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube to elevate their ideas from the thousands to the millions. They are pulling together threads of religion, spirituality, race, gender, ethics, politics, morality, philanthropy, free-speech, maths, and science and making them more accessible than they\u2019ve been before. And they\u2019re actually asking, and trying to answer, hard questions. You might be familiar with them\u200a\u2014\u200apeople like: And a whole suite of others like\u2026 Tyler Cowen, Slatestarcodex, Neil Degrasse Tyson, Catharine Mckinnon, William MacAskill, The Rubin Report and Jonathan Haidt to name just a few. The point isn\u2019t whether you agree with them or not. The point is that they make you think about hard questions. And they do it in a way that allows you to respond, process and develop your own view. As far apart as Ben Shapiro and Sam Harris are on the existence of God, they are still deeply protective of each others\u2019 right to believe, and to disagree. Public political discourse has degraded beyond repair. Social media is reinforcing our biases. But the rise of these YouTube intellectuals is a silver lining.

Google will need an incredible investment in partnerships, and do better than it has with Google Home.

The amateur assumes the war of art is over, lets his guard down and gets his ass kicked. The professional realizes that we fight a daily battle in the war of art. Amateurs live by default. Professionals are deliberate, eliminate decision fatigue and spend the bulk of their time on deep work. There\u2019s a constant dance that occurs between being an amateur and a professional when you\u2019re a creator of any kind. On the worst of days, I check email way too many times. I give in to distractions. I consume more than I create. I get nothing done. I get to the end of the day and feel like I\u2019ve wasted precious hours of my one and only life. I play like an amateur. On the best of days, I block distractions. My life is optimized for deep work. I get tons of things done. I look back at the day and feel satisfied. I\u2019ve created more than I\u2019ve consumed. I play like a professional. Even the best of us give into the temptations of the amateur. It\u2019s not a one-time thing, some moment of enlightenment or movie scene where trumpets play when we turn pro. It\u2019s something we have to do every single day. Our moments of turning pro are mundane, ordinary and without fanfare of any sort. They are simply moments when as Steven Pressfield says \u201cstop running from our fears, turn around and face them head on.\u201d We sit down, put brush to canvas, fingers to keyboard, pen to paper and start to do our work. Rinse, wash repeat. And once you\u2019ve had a taste of turning pro, you\u2019ll realize how fulfilling it is. You\u2019ll want to experience more of it. It\u2019s addictive, kind of like dopamine, except the fulfillment you get from it lasts. Just because you played like an amateur yesterday, it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t play like a pro today. Turning pro isn\u2019t a one-time decision. It\u2019s a choice we have to make every single day. Join my newsletter to receive a weekly article like this one.

Le Guin quite by accident\u200a\u2014\u200aon the library shelf, but not in the science fiction section. I was browsing the literary journals, which were stood up like little jewels in the entranceway of the library at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon. I had been sent to that section of the library by my speech coach\u200a\u2014\u200asent to find a suitably thought-provoking and emotionally stimulating passage, with less than 50 percent dialogue, that I could read aloud without rushing in less than 8 minutes. My task was to find a piece suitable for entering in competition in the Prose category, which demands of its high school competitors that they be \u201ca master storyteller, drawing the audience in with a well-cut and interesting piece, energy and variety in vocal inflection, and the ability to engross the listener in what is being read.\u201d I was not sure at all that I was any such thing, and I had no idea what I wanted to say or do. But I had propelled my 16-year-old self into this moment nonetheless, and was now spending a week of my summer vacation among the stacks of a college library, looking for a piece that I could \u201cconnect with in some way on a personal level\u201d and that \u201cflattered\u201d me and my abilities, as the guidelines for Prose suggested. It was a volume of the short-lived literary book series Left Bank that I ultimately picked up\u200a\u2014\u200aVol. 2, circa 1992, featuring Le Guin\u2019s essay \u201cIntroducing Myself.\u201d \u201cI am a man,\u201d she begins, and goes on to spin a sardonic fable rich with wordplay, arguing, with dripping sarcasm, that \u201cman\u201d is what she must be\u200a\u2014\u200asince to be a person, one must, it seems, be a man. That first sentence shocked me with its daring. I read the whole thing through, my heart beating faster with each new paragraph, and when I got done I walked it straight over to the copy machine and ran off two copies and rushed back to my speech coach as fast as I could go. \u201cWe have been told that there is only one kind of people and they are men,\u201d Le Guin writes. \u201cAnd I think it is very important that we all believe that. It certainly is important to the men.\u201d Le Guin skewers all things stereotypically masculine with dismissive wit (\u201cI can\u2019t write my name with pee in the snow\u201d) while also hinting at the toxicity of masculinity (\u201cI can\u2019t shoot my wife and children and some neighbors and then myself\u201d) in her litany of why she is not a \u201cfirst-rate man,\u201d but rather \u201ca very poor imitation or substitute man.\u201d She touches on issues of body image when she laments that she looks \u201clike a hen in a pillowcase\u201d when trying to wear \u201cthose trendy army surplus clothes with ammunition pockets from the Banana Republic Company catalogues,\u201d and manages to capture self-deprecation and mockery in the same breath. Her writing is at once abundant, rich with metaphors, jokes, plays on words and knowing cross-references, while also being singularly focused, every word pushing her narrative forward with stunningly well-crafted focus. All of this struck my 16-year-old self on two equally resonant wavelengths: First, there was an intake of breath at the thought that this was what writing could be: this sort of knowing, joking wit that was also deeply confessional and intimate. And second, a deeper realization that this is what being a woman could be: someone at once wise and self-questioning, seeking understanding and answers, unfeminine but not masculine, unflinchingly intellectual. In her 2004 anthology of non-fiction writing \u201cThe Wave in the Mind,\u201d Le Guin introduces \u201cIntroducing Myself\u201d simply as \u201ca performance piece, performed a couple of times.\u201d I can only imagine what it would have been like to see her perform it. I know that when I stood up in front of the judges in my high school speech competitions, opened my little black book, and read those opening words, \u201cI am a man,\u201d I felt wise, powerful and a little bit wicked. My speech coach loved the piece, and I loved it, deeply. Together we paired it with passages from \u201cFascinating Womanhood,\u201d a 1960s self-help book for women that seemed to capture everything retrograde about midcentury attitudes toward women, sex, marriage and domestic life. In performances, I switched between my two \u201ccharacters\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ahunched over, smirking, one eyebrow raised as I growled out the opening lines; then upright, prim, bright-eyed as I doled out saccharine advice on being a happy housewife. I didn\u2019t become a champion of the Oregon high school forensics circuit with my piece, but I did win one of the only trophies of my entire life with it. The judges praised me for originality, for a piece that was provocative and had a point of view. I was just happy to be spending so much time with Le Guin, to have the chance to embody something of that wise, powerful and slightly wicked spirit. Le Guin\u2019s words have echoed in my mind throughout the decades since I first read this deeply felt and even more deeply thought gem of an essay. On first reading, what struck me was Le Guin\u2019s sense of resignation, of confession, of having worked for too long in service of an impossible goal\u200a\u2014\u200ato live in a man\u2019s world. \u201cI look back on all my strenuous effort because I really did try, I tried hard to be man, to be a good man, and I see how I failed at that,\u201d she writes. I am not sure how I knew, even at 16, that I would become a woman who, like Le Guin, owns three bras and feels that she is shaped wrong and is not as tough as she ought to be. A woman who sheepishly tweaks out the nine or 10 hairs that grow on her chin. A woman who can\u2019t seem to find the right foothold among the available options of masculine and feminine\u200a\u2014\u200awho feels, as Le Guin wrote, that \u201cif I had any real self-respect, wouldn\u2019t I at least have had a facelift or some liposuction?\u201d As I have aged, my relationship to the feminine has remained complex. I think of Le Guin often when I look in the mirror at my messy brows or contemplate my unshaven legs. I feel vaguely urged to do something about these less-than-feminine aspects of myself. But, like Le Guin, I do not. It does not seem to be part of who I am now, any more than it was when I was 16, and shocked the freshman in my art class, who would run up, giggling, in packs, and ask, \u201cCan we see your hairy legs?\u201d I fear that I may have taken too seriously Le Guin\u2019s cynical suggestion of equating femininity with non-personhood and have, like her, ended up on a sort of third road of being some sort of \u201cpoor imitation or substitute man.\u201d But as my 40th birthday approaches, I have found myself coming back, not to Le Guin\u2019s electric opening line, but to her wry ending salvo, in which she threatens, at age 60, to \u201cgive the whole thing up\u201d and \u201cstart pretending to be an old woman.\u201d \u201cI am not sure that anybody has invented old women yet,\u201d she writes, \u201cbut it might be worth trying.\u201d Several years ago my mother, who is older now than Le Guin was at the time she wrote \u201cIntroducing Myself,\u201d confided in me about aging. \u201cThe great thing,\u201d she said, \u201cis that I just don\u2019t have to give a fuck anymore.\u201d Like my mother, and Le Guin, I am learning how to be what I am\u200a\u2014\u200astill learning from Le Guin these many years later. Learning how to not give a fuck anymore. Learning to give the whole thing up and invent something new. May we all face our own futures with a fraction of Ursula K. Le Guin\u2019s wit, insight and acuity. She has left us so many gifts to help us find our way. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

They received a good amount of attention, and people shared with me how helpful the posts were to them in understanding design better. So, I decided to write another post that\u2019s a quick introduction to two very broad topics: User Interface Design and User Experience Design. The knowledge from previous articles and this one can help you become a better designer. First off, let\u2019s answer the question: What exactly are UI design and UX design, and what is the difference between the two? Simply put, UI is how things look, UX is how things work. UX is a process, while UI is a deliverable. Let\u2019s elaborate further\u2026 User Interface (UI) design is a large field. In theory, UI is a combination of content (documents, texts, images, videos, etc), form (buttons, labels, text fields, check boxes, drop-down lists, graphic design, etc), and behavior (what happens if I click/drag/type). It takes a good eye, a lot of practice, and a lot of trial and error to get better at it. As a UI designer, your goal is to create a user interface that is engaging, beautiful, and also creates an emotional response from the user to make your products more lovable and beautiful. When I started out, something I learned from my mentor is to take a tour guide journey to your product. Imagine your app/website as a journey. Every user that downloads your app right from spotting it in the App Store/web, through using it, achieving goals or completing tasks within the app is taken on a journey. And that journey should be a delightful one. And you, as the app designer, are the craftsman that designs this journey. So you don\u2019t want to throw all the information on the screen hoping that the user will pick it up. That\u2019s the very opposite of a good UI. Instead, you\u2019re the tour guide that takes the user on a wonderful journey through your app. And in order to this, you have to be able to shift and move their attention from place to place guiding them. Design isn\u2019t all about learning to use design software \u2014although that\u2019s certainly important. Software is like a designer\u2019s sword. You need the sword to fight the battle, but that\u2019s not all you need to learn to use. You need to learn the strategies, processes, tricks and tips of the fight/game to be able to win it. In UI design, you need to brainstorm, experiment, test, and understand your users and their journey throughout using your product. The benefits of having a well-designed product is that you\u2019ll have a higher user retention rate. This is human nature. Our attention is programmed in such a way where we see the biggest, the boldest, and the brightest first. And then it moves to smaller, less bold, and less bright things. As a designer, you can use this information to curate the experience of your user. 2. The Importance of Alignment. Alignment is a fundamental aspect of UI Design. And an important design principle is: minimize the number of alignment lines. It improves readibility and makes the design more pleasing to the eye. In the images above, the image on the left has 1 alignment line. While the image on the right part has 4 alignment lines. Here\u2019s another example of how fewer alignment lines can make a great difference in improving the design. There are two fundamental types of alignment: Edge alignment and Center alignment. Depending on the usecase, you\u2019ll choose one or the other. Usually, edge alignment is considered better. It\u2019s quite easy to align elements in design software like Photoshop. Most design software will usually provide a ruler/guide to edge align all the elements. 3. Become an attention architect. Here\u2019s two ways to interpret this: 1) You need to grab the user\u2019s attention with your design. 2) You need to pay attention to every little thing in your designs.\u00a0To be a great designer, you need to do both. The latter lets you achieve the former. UI Design is about tailoring the experience for your users by guiding their attention towards different important things. Ways to use text to grab user\u2019s attention: The most important thing when designing is testing! Make sure you try out different everything: colors, fonts, tones, angles, alignment, layout, etc. Experiment with different designs so that you can architect a user journey using various ways of commanding attention.

User Experience (UX) design is about creating pain-free and enjoyable experiences.

It was the summer and I\u2019d been on Tumblr, my newsfeed virtually a photographic exploration of the ex-One Direction superstar. I knew exactly what she was referencing: when Zayn walked past the cameras at a Louis Vuitton show, sporting newly shaved platinum-blonde hair and a silk floral shirt with a brocaded \u201cLouis Vuitton\u201d stretched across his chest, like a banner. Before Zayn\u2019s departure from the monochromatic boyband lifestyle, he was a poster boy for on trend. Now, all of the sudden, he was an eccentric. Every action filled with a resoluteness that comes naturally with mapping your own destiny. This Zayn, this handsome Gary Busey-esque creature of well-timed defiance, conquered all questions of masculinity, and its servile definitions. The cruel abstraction of masculinity is that men must be macho, unfeeling; devoid of emotional truth and honesty. Essentially, men who aren\u2019t real. Zayn is a new breed of male. Soft-spoken and mysterious, with a gentle repose, Zayn is both a heartthrob and an idealist. People tend to think that humans exist in binaries, but through the ostensible oxymoron that is \u201cMuslim pop star,\u201d Zayn is a new category in himself. He has feelings. He has emotions. The world pushes men like him towards the patriarchy, towards categorization\u200a\u2014\u200abut as a Muslim pop star, he exists outside of it. You see, Zayn is a Softboy. Someone who is \u201cNice yet Complicated,\u201d according to Softboy luminary Alan Hanson. As a Pisces Moon, Zayn is an emotional creature. The nuance of his unease is rooted in an unabashed honesty. In April, he tweeted: \u201cWanna say thanks to everyone that\u2019s been there for me over the last few weeks, love you all.. you know who you are x.\u201d In typical Softboy fashion, he\u2019s generous\u200a\u2014\u200ahe bought his parent\u2019s house for them, and he funds his cousin\u2019s private school education. He prefers to call his fans \u201cpassionate\u201d as opposed to crazy; he knows the cost of impertinence. Zayn, however, is also aware of his mistakes\u200a\u2014\u200ahis penchant for alcohol, girls\u200a\u2014\u200abut wants to make them anyway. The Softboy oscillates between being kind-hearted and scathing. Earlier this year, he tweeted about former friend and producer Naughty Boy: \u201cYou fat joke, stop pretending we\u2019re friends.\u201d But we all know that Softboy Zayn probably felt really bad after that. Sensitive. Self-aware. Coy. Despite The Softboy\u2019s connotations, this status is powerful\u200a\u2014\u200abecause Muslim men aren\u2019t ever seen as Softboys. Muslim men aren\u2019t ever seen as docile. They are feared and vilified, marginalized and taunted\u200a\u2014\u200aand even if they are \u201cshy\u201d that\u2019s always characterized as something more nefarious. When the world pictures Muslim men, they see beards and cloaked bodies, gangly, dirt-smeared refugees. And they think: terrorists. Or at least that\u2019s what a Texas teacher thought this year when 14-year-old Ahmed Mohammed was arrested for making a clock in school. His teacher labeled it suspicious because of his name and ethnicity, but Mohammed later explained that he made the clock to \u201cimpress his teacher.\u201d His innocence was misread as a threat. His shyness and softness were seen as incongruent within the construct of Muslim masculinity. If you Google \u201cMuslim boy\u201d there\u2019s no accompanying photo of Zayn being a shy kid at a British elementary school, getting good grades, challenging stereotypes. These Muslim boys turn into Muslim men; they are never shown to exist within the appurtenance of innocence. So when Muslim pop stars publicly identify as such, it proves that Islam\u200a\u2014\u200aa religion that\u2019s so often been reduced to an exaggeration\u200a\u2014\u200ahas cultural value. The very presence of Zayn, then, a British Muslim male superstar, who has captured our hearts through his demure shyness, ruptures the dichotomy of us versus them, because one of them becomes an us. But the one that becomes an us still has to explain the actions of them\u200a\u2014\u200aor namely the violent, extremist ones. When Zayn tweeted \u201c#FreePalestine\u201d late last year, he was confronted by death threats. The public statement was innocent, but others didn\u2019t read it as such. And in a matter of seconds, Zayn\u2019s honest thought was overridden and dismissed by a pugnacious readership. That wasn\u2019t the first time Zayn experienced this type of xenophobia in his career. In 2012, after The Telegraph declared that One Direction\u2019s success hinged on the fact they were \u201cclean cut, wholesome, whiter-than-white,\u201d (which in itself is problematic), Zayn was accused of pimping Islam on people\u2019s children through \u201cboy band Jihad\u201d by blogger Debbie Schlussel. In another stinging move, earlier this year, Bill Maher gleefully joked about the supposed likeness between him and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the Boston Marathon bomber. To most, these jokes are innocuous, but they are indicative of something far more nefarious: the synecdochic treatment of a marginalized people, a single person plucked to represent the entire group. No matter their fame, Muslim men are treated as second-class citizens. But it\u2019s obvious that Zayn doesn\u2019t want to be defined by his Muslim leanings or his Softboy ideals; he just wants to be a person who exists in his own impersonal limbo. He wants the chance to figure himself out, outside of the world that had been shaped for him; he wants \u201cto be a normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight.\u201d With his residue of softness, there is an irrevocable desire for truth and integrity: \u201cI just need to be me now, because I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d After leaving the group, Zayn drastically changed his hair\u200a\u2014\u200abuzzed, then lime green, platinum blond, representative of a diminutive Amber Rose. In itself, this is a statement: he\u2019s grappling with the idea of finding himself and being true to what that means. By not giving a fuck about his Muslim ideals or what the Western world wants, he\u2019s effectively declaring his validity as a young Muslim man. I\u2019ve also sometimes felt splintered in two: I\u2019m both a child of the West, and deeply rooted in my Muslim and South Asian heritage. I\u2019ve always wanted to dictate how I live, by my own standards, never by what was imposed on me. By the same token, I crave Islam; it\u2019s in my bones. The world sees Islam as incompatible with Western values, but what if these two cultures colliding into a spectacular swirl\u200a\u2014\u200alike a soft serve with two flavors\u200a\u2014\u200ais what best represents Zayn and I? By saying very little about what he\u2019s up to, or where he stands politically, Zayn\u2019s pushing off decolonization, and starting anew. Working with mostly people of color on his forthcoming solo album (Malay, who is half-Asian, and who has worked with John Legend and Frank Ocean, is producing the album) shows an interest to be true to his definitions, to be a perfunctory role model by just being himself. He\u2019s separating his identity from the pallid whiteness that previously bled out his other dimensions. His irreverence of fame\u200a\u2014\u200ahis desire to be a person of his own design, no matter what it costs him publicly\u200a\u2014\u200afeels resonant of something much more vital: he\u2019s carving a space for himself. He\u2019s reclaiming what it means to be Zayn Malik, and thus a Muslim man of his own making. His back-and-forth search of personhood is tantamount to watching a quiet revolution. Of self, yes, but that can hardly be dismissed when Muslim masculinity is defined by ISIS soldiers beheading Western journalists. The war on terror has been waged against men who look like Zayn. When Western culture has institutionalized the erasure of men like you, it is a sincere revolution to be yourself. This is when self-love\u200a\u2014\u200aas in being true to yourself\u200a\u2014\u200ais an act of resistance. There is nothing hyperbolic about what he is doing; no exaggeration of his impact. He\u2019s simply being. Being in a world that wants you to be a certain way, a way that he is not. Inspiration can\u2019t be false-hearted, and although he\u2019s only just 22, he represents the halcyon of an era that\u2019s to come where we respect Muslims to be, but also where we allow men to be charged with emotionality. Men are taught to have egos, but never to truly like themselves. Within his framework, you see Zayn trying, through acceptance, to shift our perceptions of Muslim men, and even all men. Softboy, or not. When I look at Zayn, I see my brothers in my faith who have been guilt-ridden, traumatized, and blamed for actions outside of them. So when Zayn shows off in public what\u2019s done in private, he\u2019s asking for change. Muslims aren\u2019t allowed that kind of transparency\u200a\u2014\u200athey are not leveled that same tolerance, either. There\u2019s a power in claiming the privilege exists outside of you; to act badly, but to demand respect. The kind of respect your white peers get so easily, without the same need to be perfect, or to behave elegantly all the time. To subvert while complying, is an act of resistance. To be gentle, when men like are you seen as anything but\u200a\u2014\u200awell, that\u2019s change.

IMHO, a change in thinking is required. As android developers, we start any app with allowing orientation change in mind. Later we cherry pick activities that require orientation lock. But, with so many apps as example, we should start apps with locked orientation, and later selectively allow some activities to change orientation. Allowing orientation change requires extra code. It requires more efforts, and time. If not done properly, it may result in leaks or improper states. It may result in bugs sometimes. And this is a continuous process. Whenever you implement something new, you need to take orientation change into consideration. My entire experience is in startups. And I can say that as developers in startups, the only thing that we need to do for our companies is to implement new/ modify old features faster. Most of the times, startups don\u2019t even know what would click with the end customer. Hence, the faster we iterate, the more closer to success we\u2019d reach. In this sprint, allowing orientation change just isn\u2019t worth it! By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

There are rumors that the mayor and UAW president Dennis Williams are trying to recruit a white man. Literally. They want a white guy. They won\u2019t back a white woman. Really? a bunch of guys who are too afraid to step up and run themselves or even go on record\u2026 they will tell us what Detroit wants\u2026 they\u2019re not relevant any more. Read the article below, for the cast of characters. And what does Dennis Williams know about Detroit\u200a\u2014\u200ahe is from Ohio. And don\u2019t get me started on \u201cLivonia Mike\u201d. He is not a Detroiter. He is a con man. This \u201cmagazine\u201d is from Lansing and think they can write about what Detroit wants? And the \u201cProgressive\u201d purists want to assume Gretchen will not put forth progressive policies because of who her father was. I mean, really? I am just so over these stupid arguments! Gretchen Whitmer is a Progressive. And yes, she is connecting\u200a\u2014 at the grassroots level. I held a really great House Party for Gretchen in Detroit, before the Holidays. It was standing room only. Gretchen was Knowledgable. Passionate. Candid. And yes, PROGRESSIVE. Because she connects at a grassroots level the \u201cestablishment\u201d does not see that. They never do. They ignore the grassroots and we lose. Screw them. I support Gretchen. She was in the middle of the protesters when Right To Work legislation was being voted on. She opened the doors to the Capitol so the protestors could Shame the Senate! She pushed away the Capitol Police when they thought she needed protection. She told them she didn\u2019t need their assistance, she was with HER people! I want Gretchen to continue the fight. She lived through devastating years in the State Senate under Republican control. She knows what the Republicans did to our great state. She knows what to fix from first hand experience. She doesn\u2019t have to imagine what she would do. She led a Minority Party. Gretchen knows what to do on DAY ONE. We don\u2019t need an \u201con the job training\u201d Governor to fix what Republicans have broken\u2026on purpose. What she did during her tenure in the legislature, WAS Resistance! Way before it was a movement. The last time we had a Democratic woman running for Gov the result was 8 years of a Democratic Governor. The grassroots Detroiters are with Gretchen, and we are proud to fight for her, phone bank for her, organize for her. We are mobilized and this bullshit just adds fuel to our fire! I am a proud Berniecrat. I served on the DNC platform committee in 2016 (for Bernie) and was a super volunteer for Bernie in Michigan. I don\u2019t take kindly to people saying they are like Bernie or other people bestowing upon a candidate, that moniker. This race in Michigan is not a mirror of Bernie and Hillary. That is old news. Bernie has moved on and he continues the fight, working with Democrats. He continues to rally people to run for office and to VOTE! He has a Youtube library of videos, that shows exactly where he stood in the past and present. Gretchen also has a library of videos of her time serving in the State Legislature. Just search and watch! She has the receipts to show that she fought for us in the past, and will fight for us in the future, when she is the next Governor of Michigan. #WinWithWhitmer 1/21/18 update 1/24/18 update Poll: Whitmer leads Schuette by 7 points in gov race By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

From past experiences, I\u2019ve seen it being treated as just a \u2018feature\u2019 that overloads users with irrelevant information for fear of product abandonment. Studies in psychology have shown that people have a finite capacity for remembering things, typically up to 4 at a time. So, if you teach them everything there is to learn about your product in one go, they will likely forget it tomorrow. An approach that I often find effective in co-designing user onboarding experiences with my clients is to take a step back from the product that we are designing for and relate it back to real-life experiences. Matt Hryhorsky, design director of Filament Labs, calls this UX in Real Life (UX IRL), which is simply the idea of using the real world as an inspiration to create better user experiences within the digital world. These experiences don\u2019t have to be anything complicated. I like to use a nightclub as an example (but I might switch to other scenarios depending on the project and the type of clients that I am working with). This reinforces radical customer-centricity amongst my clients whom I\u2019m working with. This approach gives them the permission to look up from their screens, temporarily shift their focus away from the business perspective, investigate the physical world and explore how users behave and find their way in the physical space. Because user onboarding is a critical component of any product flow, it\u2019s important to bring your full creative self to this design process. Sure, there are often barriers to spending the right amount of time and energy on this phase, but one way to get that time and budget is to show a more direct value-add by spending time seeing how this translates to real life spaces to build a stronger appreciation for the work. Then it becomes easier for your end users to understand how they might get the most value from your product. Slightly more than a year ago, I decided to use this approach while I was working on the user onboarding flow for an online marketplace project. We were trying to solve an issue on how to better onboard our users to the key features within our website. I designed the look and feel of my workshop to be reminiscent of a nightclub environment\u200a\u2014\u200acomplete with a mini dance floor and a bar, both of which we defined as \u2018key features\u2019 of our nightclub. Our primary goal out of this workshop was to think of ways on what we can do in order to get our customers to start interacting and dance with one another on the dance floor. I convinced my clients/stakeholders to adopt different roles in the nightclub\u200a\u2014\u200aas a bartender, a bouncer, nightclub owner, customers\u200a\u2014\u200aand gave each of them different goals to accomplish. Getting them to adopt different roles than they were traditionally used to, was useful in getting them to shift their mindset towards becoming more customer-centric. By the end of the workshop, we got extremely creative with our end solution, as we figured out what worked and what didn\u2019t. We ended up coming up with a solution that ultimately provided an empathetic, seamless and enjoyable experience for our users! #winning The \u2018nightclub\u2019 experience gives us several helpful tips and reminders on how we can better onboard our customers to our product. Below are my three key lessons for using a nightclub experience to better design an onboarding experience. Picture this. You arrive at the nightclub together with a group of friends. You slowly make your way past the bouncer\u2026 and upon entering the nightclub, you receive a drink card that entitles you to one free drink. What do you do next? Locate the bar and claim your free drink, of course! What a great way to start your night with a win! Giving a free drink card to your customers evokes a sense of accomplishment. You are getting your customers to start somewhere and complete a small, tangible task.. Note that you are providing them with more than just a free drink; they are also getting acquainted with the bar. Once they know where the bar is, the likelihood of them purchasing subsequent drinks increases. The concept of providing free samples have been used by marketers for decades and is a common design pattern in the user experience world. This is a proven strategy that works in establishing trust while setting a positive tone amongst your customers. This is also effective in delivering value to your customers before they make that decision to sign up for your product. Medium, an online publishing platform, utilises the free sample design pattern quite heavily with its non-paying members. Non-paying members are able to access up to three exclusive stories within a month that are currently only accessible to its paid members. After they hit the three article limit, they are blocked from all other exclusive stories until the following month unless they choose to upgrade their membership status during this period. This is a great strategy for me to enjoy some of the benefits that are currently exclusive to paid members, and may convince me to upgrade my membership status. Next. Imagine this. You enter the nightclub with your friends, and you can\u2019t help but to notice that there\u2019s hardly anyone dancing on the dance floor. How does that make you feel? And what would you do next? Would you be comfortable to be the first person to go on the dance floor? Or, what if there were other people dancing on the dance floor? What would you do then? Would you be more comfortable joining in on the action instead? As for me, I\u2019d feel quite conscious about being the first person to be on the dance floor and I might consider leaving the club for another. This could have been different had there been other people dancing on the dance floor, as seeing other people dancing will actually build my confidence and enable me to join them. Nielsen Norman labels this as \u2018Social Proof\u2019 and describes it as a psychological phenomenon where people reference the behaviour of others to guide their own behaviour. This concept can be used in a number of ways\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding user reviews, testimonials, quotes, and statistics representing the product\u2019s usage\u200a\u2014\u200ain order to help drive user decisions in the direction that your business might want them to go during user onboarding flows. This is extremely useful in promoting credibility within your product in order to increase adoption. Imagine you are busting your best moves on the dance floor\u2026 having a good time with your friends. Everything\u2019s going exceptionally well until a club promoter keeps showing up in front of you and tapping your shoulders every other minute\u2026 asking you if you\u2019d like to purchase more drinks and/or informing you of the latest hourly specials. How does this impact your nightclub experience, and is it in a good or bad way? You\u2019d likely eventually get frustrated and end up leaving the nightclub\u2026 never to come back again. The annoying club promoter is what we would identify as \u2018friction\u2019 in user experience. Anyone who uses Hotels.com, a hotel booking site, will be familiar with the activity alert that pops up from the bottom of the screen every 5 seconds. Although its main purpose is probably to speed up the whole decision-making process, it can also cause annoyance and encourages users to arrive at a decision that may be rushed and not well-informed. It can be tempting to inform your users about everything there is to know in one go, by prompting them every single step of the way. Don\u2019t overwhelm them in a single instance. Context is key in user experience and while you should strive to provide relevant information all the time, only do it when they need it. Regardless of why people go to a nightclub, their ultimate goal is to have a good time and have fun! The features that exist within the nightclub, such as the bar and/or a dance floor, are simply tools to help them do that. Your users have goals that they want to accomplish by using your product. Your onboarding experience should ultimately enable your users to achieve those goals, not just yours. And you can easily uncover what that goal is by engaging in conversations with them during testing and research. The path to designing a good onboarding experience can be filled with a lot of problems along the way, as it requires a lot of continued investment and attention. However, the answer to that problem that you\u2019ve been trying to solve regarding your product\u2019s onboarding has always been around you. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f A special shoutout to Aimee Gonzalez-Cameron (#UXStoryteller) for all her sweat that went towards reviewing and pushing me to make this article more amazing than it would have been otherwise.

It\u2019s not about fame, money, friends or magic tricks that are best kept at the circus. I spent three years writing nonsense about stuff I hated. I hung out at weekend events recording video interviews that made me fall asleep when I watched them back. I said dumb stuff that upset people. I reached out to lots of publications who turned me down or never responded. I got told \u201cno\u201d more times than I\u2019ve had hot dinners. For a long time, I had no credibility or reason for people to support me. Worked my face off.Posted blog articles at least three times a week.Created the best art I could.Stay inspired through podcasts and books.Had Skype calls with top writers and offered them something in return.Showed kindness towards every comment whether positive or negative. I executed on my goals every single day until I got what I wanted. I chose inspiration and leading people, over Netflix and chill. Even after having many viral articles on the Internet, I managed to write something the other day that got 17 likes in total. It sucked worse than anything I\u2019ve produced. You\u2019ll go up, you\u2019ll go down and you\u2019ll rise again. It\u2019s all part of the process. I got on many of these top publications by posting non-stop on lesser-known publications first. I wrote a lot so I could find my voice. I looked everywhere for advice that would help people. I never gave up and kept building momentum. If you want to write for a top publication or be successful at anything, then you must understand that there is no shortcut other than putting in the work and executing. There\u2019s no shortcut. It all starts with you. Oh, and you have to actually create something that is of value. No one is rewarding you for generic, unhelpful, self-promoting pieces of content/writing.

To be honest, that surprised me\u200a\u2014\u200aI wasn\u2019t sure how relevant it would be to me, but it turned out to be the most on-the-nose conference I could\u2019ve wished for. Seeing as the event was all about design leadership, there was inevitably some talk of design ops. But I noticed that the term was being used in two different ways. Sometimes a speaker would talk about design ops and mean \u201coperations, specifically for designers.\u201d That means all the usual office practicalities\u200a\u2014\u200aequipment, furniture, software\u200a\u2014\u200athat designers might need to do their jobs. For example, one of the speakers recommended having a dedicated design ops person rather than trying to juggle that yourself. That\u2019s good advice, as long as you understand what\u2019s meant by design ops in that context. There\u2019s another context of use for the phrase \u201cdesign ops\u201d, and it\u2019s one that we use far more often at Clearleft. It\u2019s related to design systems. Now, \u201cdesign system\u201d is itself a term that can be ambiguous. See also \u201cpattern library\u201d and \u201cstyle guide\u201d. Quite a few people have had a stab at disambiguating those terms, and I think there\u2019s general agreement\u200a\u2014\u200aa design system is the overall big-picture \u201cthing\u201d that can contain a pattern library, and/or a style guide, and/or much more besides: None of those great posts attempt to define design ops, and that\u2019s totally fair, because they\u2019re all attempting to define things\u200a\u2014\u200astyle guides, pattern libraries, and design systems\u200a\u2014\u200awhereas design ops isn\u2019t a thing, it\u2019s a practice. But I do think that design ops follows on nicely from design systems. I think that design ops is the practice of adopting and using a design system. There are plenty of posts out there about the challenges of getting people to use a design system, and while very few of them use the term design ops, I think that\u2019s what all of them are about: Clearly design systems and design ops are very closely related: you really can\u2019t have one without the other. What I find interesting is that a lot of the challenges relating to design systems (and pattern libraries, and style guides) might be technical, whereas the challenges of design ops are almost entirely cultural. I realise that tying design ops directly to design systems is somewhat limiting, and the truth is that design ops can encompass much more. I like Andy\u2019s description: Now, in theory, that can encompass any operational stuff\u200a\u2014\u200aequipment, furniture, software\u200a\u2014\u200abut in practice, when we\u2019re dealing with design ops, 90% of the time it\u2019s related to a design system. I guess I could use a whole new term (design systems ops?) but I think the term design ops works well\u00a0\u2026as long as everyone involved is clear on the kind of design ops we\u2019re all talking about.

When in Rome, for example, you are required to wear your cassock or at least a clergy shirt, and bishops and cardinals are expected to wear their flowing robes. But Jorge Mario Bergoglio, who was cardinal of Buenos Aires before he became known to the world as Pope Francis, hated pomp and ceremony and was not very proper at all. He kept his scarlet robes in a convent founded by an Argentine nun, so he wouldn\u2019t have to carry the damn things back and forth to Vatican City. Before heading for a priests\u2019 residence in central Rome he would stop by the convent, chat for a bit, and pick up the garments, which had been reverently pressed and folded for him by the nuns. Bergoglio stopped at the convent one last time, last year in March, on his way to the historic conclave of 115 cardinals that would elect him the first Latin American pope and the first from the order of the Society of Jesus\u2014the Jesuits. He must have had a very good idea of his chances. Little known beyond Argentina, he had nevertheless finished second in the vote that elected Benedict XVI in 2005. It was understood that he was an outlier, ascetic, unconventional to a fault, but he seemed to be the right kind of pope to clean up the world\u2019s oldest and largest institution, hemorrhaging followers and riddled as it is with ancient vices, and bring it into the XXIst century. What may not have been so clear to the cardinals who chose him above all others at that conclave is that Francis would enter the Vatican like Jesus into the Temple or a bull into a china shop, knocking over conventions and rules with abandon. And what stunned everyone was that, from the moment he stepped out on the balcony of St. Peter\u2019s for the first time on that drizzly evening, he would channel a ravening hunger for change among millions of people all over the world. He certainly didn\u2019t look like a world-changer. A mild-mannered, slightly stooped, grandfatherly old man dressed in simplest white\u2014no lace and scarlet finery for him\u2014he stood quietly contemplating the crowd for a very long minute before uttering a hearty buona sera! with a pronounced Argentine accent. The effort of bending forward to receive the people\u2019s blessing made Francis\u2019s back tremble slightly, and watching on a screen I, a non-Catholic, was moved, too. A few weeks later, on a plane coming back from Brazil, he uttered his famous \u201cwho am I to judge\u201d gays, and things started to move very fast. What, really, can we make of this strange new pope? Hundreds of thousands of words have been written in the effort to understand him. He is without question the most popular human being alive today: Barack Obama gets an average of 1,300 retweets on his account; Pope Francis gets twenty thousand. Beyonc\u00e9, traveling from one city to another, fills an auditorium in each with twenty or forty-five thousand people. Francis, a 77-year-old who walks with a limp, has been filling St. Peter\u2019s square every Wednesday morning with between eighty and a hundred thousand euphoric people. \u201cWho cares what that old man says?\u201d a worldly friend of mine said recently. Well, a jillion Catholics do, not to mention a large number of Palestinians and Israelis who looked on in astonishment as Francis, with a series of shockingly simple gestures, preached a wordless sermon of tolerance in the Middle East in May. Smiling, kissing babies, embracing beggars, donning a fan\u2019s baseball cap, saying plain things in plain Italian, scoffing at his own church\u2019s obsession with sex, the pope seems to us intimate and sensible, affectionate, neighborly, instantly readable, radiating warmth. Jorge Mario Bergoglio is, no doubt, all of these things, and also, sometimes, positively odd. He doesn\u2019t take vacations. He\u2019s terrible at languages. In the days following his election, he snuck out of the Vatican late at night to distribute alms among the homeless. He likes to imitate Christ, and he avails himself of random opportunities to engage in foot-washing, even though standard church practice is for priests and popes to wash the feet of twelve men of the faith\u2014not women\u2014only during Easter Week. But there are also earlier and more troubling stories from a lifetime ago, that in 1976, as head of the Argentine Jesuits, he ousted two of his radicalized left-wing priests from the order, leaving them with no protection against the searing repression that was getting started under the supervision of the country\u2019s fanatical right-wing generals. The self-abaser who washes feet, the representative of Christ on earth who repeats earnestly that he is a sinner, the troubled autocrat who may indeed have committed a terrible sin, the beaming, fatherly pope who gives hope and spiritual sustenance to millions are one and the same person\u2014a complicated man, conservative and radical, charitable and intransigent, a mass of contradictions. Eager to get the church back to its foundational years of poverty and evangelization, he\u2019s made enormous changes already in everything from the way church finances are run to the renewed sense of purpose clergy now have in their lives. Always fearless, he has just boomed out a verbal excommunication of all members of the \u2019Ndrangheta, a particularly vicious global mafia organization based in Calabria. But a number of things stand in the way of his ambitious plans for the church\u2019s future: his own character, which in the past has made him a divisive leader; the Vatican Curia, or government, beset with corruption and inefficiency; deeply conservative church hierarchies everywhere from Africa to the United States; and his health, which is far from good. This last month alone he cancelled two full days of appointments due to fatigue, and last week the Vatican announced that Francis would cancel his regular Wednesday audiences and daily morning masses through July. He has much to accomplish, and a larger mandate than any previous pope in memory to achieve his goals, but time and institutions stand in his way. One afternoon on the Borgo Pio\u2014the Vatican neighborhood\u2019s restaurant row\u2014I talked late into the lunch hour with Jesuit Father Gabriel Ignacio Rodr\u00edguez, an intensely spiritual and friendly Colombian priest, about Francis, and his own feelings toward this startling pope. \u201cFrancis surprises me every day!\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said, speaking in a hushed, churchy voice in the crowded restaurant, and managing the trick of exclaiming under his breath. He had been looking back to the \u201chorrendous\u201d years of Benedict XVI\u2019s papacy, during which, whenever the church was in the news it was because of another financial scandal, or accusations of pedophilia against one more bishop, while the shy, elderly Benedict withdrew into his own rooms, increasingly aware that he was unfit to cope with the crisis. With the shock of Benedict\u2019s resignation in February of last year came the sense of a church unmoored. \u201cThe only way I can explain the difference between that day\u2014Benedict\u2019s resignation\u2014and what we have today is that God became present in the church,\u201d he said. \u201cFrancis is a man who\u2019s in the news every day because he surprises every day. Because he\u2019s free, and human, and responds to the events of everyday life with an open heart.\u201d \u201cThe way he interacts with people is clearly that of a Latin American man,\u201d he added. \u201cThe kneeling everywhere, giving away rosaries, carrying the gospel around in his pocket\u2014all of these are part of the religiosity of the people. It\u2019s based on signs\u2014symbols, gestures. European religion is more in the brain; more about discourse and categories. And then there\u2019s the physical element. He needs contact. He arrives at a gathering looking worn, and in a few minutes he\u2019s recharged through the contact with people.\u201d Rodr\u00edguez leaned back in his chair, considering the joyful new sense of purpose that fills him and his brethren, the electrified crowds in St. Peter\u2019s, the non-Catholic world\u2019s enthusiasm. \u201cIf that isn\u2019t God acting,\u201d he exclaimed, out loud this time and with an enormous smile, \u201cthen tell me what it is!\u201d I had the impression, as I made the Vatican rounds, that I was talking to men who hadn\u2019t laughed in a while and were now relishing the opportunity. One afternoon I sat in the chic white office of Antonio Spadaro, who is the editor in chief of the influential Jesuit magazine Civilt\u00e0 Cattolica. Last August, Francis chose the crisp, witty Spadaro as the interlocutor for his first lengthy interview, a text whose many ideas have been read, studied, and quoted in the Catholic world any number of times since. But what Spadaro wanted to talk about when we met was not the interview but the man. \u201cThe first time I met him, he gave me a hug,\u201d Spadaro said of Francis. \u201cAnd what was surprising was how comfortable it felt. The cercan\u00eda, the closeness, struck me. \u201cPeople who knew him [before he was elected pope] say he was not always like this. He was more serious, withdrawn. Now he is more smiling, more expansive, as if he were more happy with himself. He has even gotten maybe a little bit fat, or not really fat.\u201d Spadaro smiled affectionately and made a plump-y gesture with his hands. \u201cMaybe more at ease.\u201d Truly, one can look through hundreds of photos of Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Argentina and not find one in which he is smiling. Asked to define himself in the interview with Spadaro, Pope Francis answered, \u201cI am a sinner,\u201d and added, \u201cIt is not a figure of speech, a literary genre\u2026. I am a sinner whom the Lord has looked upon.\u201d Spadaro, who has clearly reflected intensely on every aspect of his meeting with Francis ever since (\u201cHe changed my life!\u201d he says now) considered his subject: \u201cThere have been many crises in his life,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are part of his personality. He has experienced suffering.\u201d It was in 1973 when Bergoglio\u2019s time of greatest suffering began. He was 36 years old and newly named as provincial superior, or national director, of the Argentine Jesuits. I was much younger than that and passing through Buenos Aires at the time, and clearly recall the collective political insanity of the period. The military, having deposed the populist leader Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n years earlier, had just decided to allow him back. But the Peronist movement was split into a dozen factions, notably an ultranationalist far-right wing allied with sections of the putschist military, and an ultranationalist far-left wing spearheaded by a guerrilla organization, the Montoneros. The military set up clandestine torture centers and disappeared thousands of suspected guerrillas and their sympathizers. The guerrillas assassinated \u201cclass enemies\u201d and set off bombs. Neighborhood priests became radicalized under the banner of the new, left-wing liberation theology (which claimed that the church should have \u201ca preferential option for the poor\u201d) or its Peronist variation, theology of the people (which shared that aim, but without liberation theology\u2019s Marxist influence). Much of the church hierarchy collaborated openly and shamefully with the government torturers. Where was Jorge Bergoglio in all this? He was, at a minimum, sympathetic with a thuggish Peronist group called the Iron Guard, and eventually turned over administration of one of the Jesuits\u2019 two universities in Buenos Aires to a few of its leading members. The historian Tulio Halper\u00edn Donghi remembered the group well: \u201cIt was a fairly sinister organization. In the [university] schools of the humanities, which were always the most political, these furies would suddenly appear, swinging chains,\u201d he told me in a recent phone conversation. \u201cIt was completely crazy, because aside from everything else they were vegans, or something like that.\u201d Bergoglio took his final vows in April 1973, as a member of the rigorous order of Jesuits, and barely three months later he was named provincial. He was too young, he says of that time now, but most of all he appears to have been far too inexperienced. During those years several radicalized Jesuit priests who worked in the shanty towns around Buenos Aires became trapped in a net of gossip and rumors against them, a net that their direct superior, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, may have helped to weave. The accusations centered on two men: the Hungarian-born Franz Jalics and the Argentine Orlando Yorio. Bergoglio, whose job as provincial it was to assign priests to their posts, kept telling the two priests that there was pressure from Rome to remove them from pastoral work. But he would not tell them why, or what the accusations were, according to a detailed account of the whole affair written by Yorio. The fact that Bergoglio was not only ideologically opposed to the activist priests but also younger\u2014he had been their student\u2014was no doubt a factor in the tensions between them. But the poisonous gossip that surrounded Yorio and Jalics wherever they went had to do with their politics, and especially with a general suspicion that Yorio was having an affair with one of the young women in the community and collaborating with the Montoneros. What happened next is in dispute. According to the most informed versions, Bergoglio told the men that if they wished to stay in the Jesuit order they had to suspend their radical organizing activities in the barrio where they were working. They refused, and in May 1976 they were expelled, forfeiting whatever protection the church could have afforded them. Within days they were picked up by men working for the Navy commander, Admiral Emilio Massera, who supervised the most horrifying of the torture centers. The two men were first told that their detention had been a \u201cmistake\u201d and then spent five months in what were, by the standard of what is now known as the Dirty War, privileged circumstances: blindfolded, in chains, and all but starved in filthy cells. Yorio maintained until his death in 2000 that Bergoglio tricked him and Jalics into signing their voluntary dismissal, and that he was to blame for their kidnapping. Bergoglio says that the two priests left voluntarily, and that when they were taken he did everything in his power to obtain their release, using his contacts on the right to obtain two interviews with General Jorge Rafael Videla, the fanatic in charge of the brand-new military junta, and to get in touch with the torturer Massera. Two former members of the Iron Guard surfaced last year to state that they had personally carried a request from Bergoglio to Massera to free the two priests. If this version of the story is true, it would explain why Jalics and Yorio survived, when the other members of the community picked up during that week were never seen again. One year after the priests were released, Massera got an honorary doctorate from the Jesuit university. Franz Jalics is still alive. He lives in seclusion in a German monastery, and since Bergoglio\u2019s election has declared that Bergoglio was not guilty, that he had made his peace with the events of that era, and that he would say no more on the matter. In 2013 he met in strict privacy with Francis for the second time since his imprisonment in Argentina, during an unannounced visit to the Vatican. But there is yet another side to Bergoglio\u2019s activity during the Dirty War. A number of persecuted guerrillas, some of them from neighboring Uruguay, have testified that during that same period, and at great risk to himself, Bergoglio helped them hide or escape Argentina. There is also the testimony of a longtime human rights worker, Alicia Oliveira, who says that at a time when she was receiving threats and in constant danger of being stuffed into an unmarked car by Massera\u2019s men, she decided to leave her child in the care of others for his protection. Bergoglio, she says, would pick her up in the afternoons and drive her to her son\u2019s school, so that she could see him from a safe distance when school let out. What if all versions were true? At a minimum, writes Paul Vallely, the most careful of the pope\u2019s many biographers, Bergoglio seems to have clashed with two of his brother Jesuits, whom he was in charge of protecting, and behaved rashly and in ways that put his own flock in danger. The fierce divisions created by Bergoglio\u2019s actions in the Argentine Jesuit order remained until 1986, when Rome intervened. A Colombian Jesuit was sent to reconcile the warring pro- and anti-Bergoglio factions, and Bergoglio was sent away, first to Germany and then to C\u00f3rdoba, in northern Argentina. He has had 40 years to reconsider, and suffer. Forty years is a lifetime, and people change. Montoneros who once placed bombs are now respectable citizens, for example, and Francis has changed so dramatically that he now seems as radical a social activist as the men he once assailed. \u201cHe realized that there is a pedagogy of God,\u201d Spadaro said now about that period. \u201cHe says, \u2018God worked in me through those mistakes.\u2019\u201d The pope eats well and sleeps well, he told Spadaro, and I found myself wondering if the beaming Francis, whose belly laughs resound in the Vatican halls and who generally appears to be having a whale of a time in his new ministry, feels that when God looked upon him and granted him the punishing gift of the papacy, He signaled that he was forgiven. I tried the theory out on Spadaro, who looked at me askance. \u201cHe feels himself to be a mystery,\u201d he said, and corrected that statement. \u201cHe feels himself to be carrying a mystery within himself.\u201d One night I had dinner near the Vatican with a parish priest from Colombia, Cristian Echeverry, a gentle man with a habit of speaking clearly. As a new priest he worked for several years in the shantytowns that ring Colombian cities, and he won\u2019t forget those first experiences. \u201cOne day I climbed up the hill and knocked at one house, and a little girl\u2014she can\u2019t have been more than fourteen\u2014opened the door, and behind her there was a string of smaller kids. She was pregnant. I asked if I could speak with her mother, and she said \u2018I\u2019m the mother here.\u2019\u201d Echeverry recalled. \u201cWhat has killed theology is that it is created by men who have never been in a barrio.\u201d Instead, church officials in the Vatican have kept busy barring the doors to Communion for remarried divorcees, preaching against the use of condoms, arguing against liberation theology (whose central concern is the \u201cperiphery,\u201d that fuzzy area beyond Europe and the United States where the vast majority of faithful are) and otherwise encouraging Catholics to leave the church in hordes. Tens of thousands of priests, and nuns, too, have defected from the church in the last 40 years, mostly so they can marry. Few others are springing up to replace them, because they are repelled by the idea of chastity. The lack of priests (and nuns) is now so acute that in parts of traditionally Catholic Mexico the work of the church is left in the hands of deacons (laymen approved by the bishop to carry out certain pastoral duties). In Brazil, in the Xingu, there are 27 priests for 700,000 Catholics in an area the size of Montana. Partly because there is no one to marry, comfort, baptize, and advise them or confess to, tens of millions of Catholics are fleeing to the evangelical sects. Countries like Guatemala may now have an evangelical majority, and in many regions of Latin America the sects are close to pulling even with the traditional Catholic Church. What if, I asked professor Guzm\u00e1n Carriquiry, a portly gentleman who, as head of the Vatican\u2019s office for Latin America, is an influential lay member of the Curia, there were a two-tier system, in which some priests chose to marry, while others could choose chastity? Carriquiry narrowed his eyes at me. \u201cAll priests who are active today did choose chastity,\u201d he reminded me. (But I am not alone in saying, nor, I suspect, would Carriquiry disagree, that a significant number of the priests in Latin America\u2014and as a reporter I have known many\u2014have been involved in some sort of relationship, gay or straight, and have made no special effort to hide it.) In Rome, it has to be said, many priests can be found who defend the principle of chastity. \u201cThere are rewards,\u201d one such thoughtful priest insisted. Like Echeverry, Father Daniel Gallagher is in his early forties, but unlike his Colombian brother in God, who is poor and ill at ease in Rome, he is an established member of the Curia, and more orthodox in his views. \u201cChastity is a sacrifice, but it can lead to such a more enriching spiritual experience!\u201d he said. \u201cI always try to communicate that to younger priests and to seminarians. \u201d But, he acknowledged, \u201cit\u2019s hard.\u201d \u201cThe battle for chastity is endless,\u201d said Echeverry in his unflinching way. \u201cAnd it gives no quarter. I have stumbled, too. But I\u2019ve often asked myself if all the energy I\u2019ve spent on the effort\u2014physical, psychic, and emotional energy\u2014could have been better used for something else.\u201d Pragmatic in a crisis, the Vatican looks like it is gearing up to decide that it needs more priests more than it needs chastity. \u201cIt is not a question of divine law, in any case,\u201d said Carriquiry. \u201cIt can be changed.\u201d And Father Rodr\u00edguez pointed out that chastity was not universal for priests until the 16th century. \u201cIt can be changed,\u201d he echoed. For his part, Pope Francis has merely said that he could not solve every problem from Rome, that priests in the Eastern Orthodox Church have always married, and that it was up to corajudo (gutsy) bishops to find a way of dealing with the issue. Much as in the United States, one would imagine, it has been left to the states to legalize marijuana piecemeal. (On the other hand, chastity has always been obligatory for nuns, and this is not likely to change now. And yes, there are indeed women in the Catholic Church\u2014although you wouldn\u2019t know it from spending time with the people who hold power, all male, and who generally paused for a thoughtful and fruitless minute whenever I asked what nun or influential churchwoman I might talk to.) While the church elaborated on the restrictions governing where and how two adults could have sex, it became gradually apparent that thousands of priests\u2014tens of thousands over the centuries, no doubt\u2014were forcing sex on children under their care. When he was head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger first brought the old scandal of pederasty into the light. As Benedict XVI, he defrocked 848 priests, and punished 2,572 less severely. But other than appointing yet another commission to study the problem, the Vatican\u2014and Francis\u2014have proposed no new measures. Concretely, there is no hint that they might recognize pederasty as a crime, not a sin, and that priests should be subject to civil court in addition to divine law. It is always worth remembering that Marcial Maciel, founder of the priestly order Legion of Christ, favorite of John Paul II, and a monstrous pederast, embezzler, plagiarist, and drug addict, was ultimately sentenced by the Vatican to a life of \u201cprayer and penance\u201d in a charming house with a garden. On other fronts Francis has proved more combative. Thoroughgoing financial reform is already under way, and an effective oversight committee for the scandal-ridden Vatican bank is in place, but pederasty is so closely linked to the now fragile finances of the church\u2014in the United States alone victims have reportedly received up to $3 billion, and many parishes have already declared bankruptcy\u2014that one can see why Francis may be wanting to move with feet of lead on the issue. \u201cMay God protect us from the fear of change,\u201d said Francis on his way to his diplomatic visit to the Middle East in May. He was undoubtedly referring to the need for peace in the region, but also to the mess waiting for him back home. Some church rules seem so out of joint with the times that they have been disregarded for decades by parish priests who are not obsessed with the issues Francis calls \u201cfrom the waist down.\u201d Pope John XXIII, now Saint John XXIII, counseled a don\u2019t-ask-don\u2019t-tell policy with regard to birth control, for example. Using the same approach, many divorced Catholics who remarry manage to participate in Catholicism\u2019s central rite regardless. Couples who live together without the marriage sacrament, even in regions where there are no priests, are deemed to be living in sin, but few priests in the periphery have the heart to rain fire and brimstone on such sinners. An extraordinary assembly of world bishops on family life will be held next October\u2014will they formally approve these slips from orthodoxy? And then there is homosexuality, whose practice caused entire cities to be destroyed by Jehovah in the Bible, and the linked subject of gay marriage. Jorge Mario Bergoglio campaigned against gay marriage in Buenos Aires, but within weeks of his election he uttered his most repeated statement: \u201cIf a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge him?\u201d It would be astonishing if Francis, leader of world Catholicism, ever sanctioned abortion or gay marriage, but he could conceivably admit that gays have had a historically strong presence in the priesthood and have as much right as heterosexuals to accept chastity and take vows. The greatest changes that have taken place under Francis are not quantifiable. At the Jesuits\u2019 Gregorian University in central Rome, which is Italy\u2019s most prestigious intellectual training center for priests, I asked a professor of sociology, Father Rocco D\u2019Ambrosio, who is also a priest in the poverty-stricken southern region of Puglia, about the impact of Francis. \u201cI took confession the other day from a woman I\u2019ve known for some time,\u201d he began. \u201cAnd she had been reading the pope\u2019s exhortation, Evangelii Gaudium (Joy of the Gospel). She wanted to talk about it, because a section of it, and something she\u2019d heard him say, had made her start to wonder whether she was bringing enough joy to the people around her.\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio, a natty man in a herringbone jacket and red glasses, leaned forward. \u201cI have been a priest, and heard confession, for 27 years, and this is the first time anyone has come to me wanting to discuss anything a pope said.\u201d I read Evangelii Gaudium, too, and found in it the same strange talent for simplicity Francis brings to every public statement. He is able to articulate basic ideals\u2014joy, mercy, forgiveness, honesty, passionate faith, the committed life\u2014that made the gospels such revolutionary and overwhelming texts centuries ago. In a quiet voice (he has been missing part of a lung since his youth, which limits the volume) and with no theatrical flourishes, he asks people to be kind and forgiving toward themselves and others and avoid cynicism. Above all, he tells people that Jesus loves them, is always waiting for them, and has an infinite capacity to forgive. \u201cI ask myself why I am so shaken,\u201d said Father Spadaro, his interviewer. \u201cAnd someone said to me, \u2018It is because he is preaching the gospel in a very simple way.\u2019\u201d Giacomo Galeazzi, a reporter at Vatican Insider, a supplement of the Turin-based newspaper La Stampa, put it best. \u201cHe\u2019s made my job more fun and more simple,\u201d he said. \u201cFrancis makes news because everybody understands what he\u2019s saying. It\u2019s like watching Maradona play: There is that beautiful clarity in his game.\u201d And so Francis is slowly dragging his church into the present, cheered on by millions of Catholics\u2014clerics and laity\u2014because through his inspired use of gestures everyone can see and understand what he\u2019s doing. On his recent trip to the Middle East he leaned his forehead against the wall built by Israel against the Palestinians, transforming it, too, into a wall of lamentation; he went everywhere with his good friends from Buenos Aires, Rabbi Abraham Skorka and the Islamic leader Sheikh Omar Abboud. He coaxed the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and President Shimon Peres of Israel into joining him at a pointedly nonpolitical prayer session in the Vatican recently. With each gesture he helped reset the terms in which the Middle East conflict might be viewed\u2014not as an inevitable clash of rabid enemies but as an anomalous and unnecessary condition keeping human beings apart. \u201cFirst he makes the gesture,\u201d Father Spadaro had explained a few weeks earlier about the pope\u2019s method. \u201cThen he says the words.\u201d Facing St. Peter\u2019s white travertine basilica, with its huge dome by Michelangelo and the stupendous lead-up of Bernini\u2019s enveloping colonnade, all one can see of the home of the Roman Catholic Church are the enormous walls that stretch out and back to either side of the basilica. They enclose the world\u2019s smallest independent nation: the Vatican (109 acres, 840 inhabitants, limited access). All is gorgeous here: Baroque chapels; Renaissance palaces where the cardinals and officers of the papal state reside in lonely majesty; the papal palace (currently unoccupied, as Francis famously refused to live in such isolated luxury); the ancient riches of the Vatican Library; a glorious expanse of gardens. Also inside the walls, but separated from the rest of the compound, is the only part of the Vatican open to the public: the museums, featuring a collection of some of the greatest works of art ever created, all for the greater glory of the church. There, too, is the vaulted space created so that cardinals under the age of eighty could have an isolated place to gather to elect a new pope: the Sistine Chapel. This compound was once the visible sign of Catholicism\u2019s glory and might, the crown of its spiritual empire. Today it is the walled fortress of a church whose very existence is threatened. Evangelical media stars preach in crystal palaces while Catholic churches fall into ruin or are sold, turned into libraries or chic dwellings. The Dalai Lama exercises increasing moral influence as head of a faith making converts around the world. For its part, the Catholic Church faces an all-encompassing crisis of shrinkage: fewer faithful; fewer priests; far, far fewer resources; and a catastrophic increase in public scandal, more or less summed up in a recent news story out of the Holy See, about a one-pound shipment of liquid-cocaine-filled condoms, hidden in a box of cushions and left unclaimed at the Vatican post office. Francis smartly avoided being sucked into the Byzantine atmosphere of the Curia by removing himself from the papal palace to the Santa Marta residence just inside the Vatican walls, where priests and bishops from all over the world come to stay. In passing he assured himself of access to news from the outside world, and guaranteed constant and friendly human contact for himself, but he may now be too removed from the web of intrigue, of which he is the center, to understand what is going on. Someone has been leaking all sorts of stuff about Pope Benedict\u2019s secretary of state, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone\u2014and there\u2019s so very much to leak! His supposed sex life, rumors of which abound in Rome; Francis\u2019 rage at Bertone\u2019s 700-square-meter penthouse, lavishly restored, right next door to Francis\u2019s two-room quarters at Santa Marta; the question of how fifteen million euros withdrawn by Bertone from Vatican funds came to end up in a film-production company owned by one of his friends. Bertone\u2019s feelings about Francis are reportedly cool, or perhaps red-hot, and apparently shared by many. It was up to the outspoken-to-a-fault Honduran archbishop, \u00d3scar Rodr\u00edguez Maradiaga, to announce the growing rebellion against Francis among the conservative hierarchy and the growing murmur that the wrong man had been handed the papal staff. \u201cExpressions like \u2018What can it be that this little Argentine pretends?\u2019\u201d said Maradiaga at a meeting of Franciscan orders, adding that a well-known cardinal had let slip the phrase, \u201cWe made a mistake.\u201d I asked a fair-minded man with good access to the thinking in the Curia whether he thought there was a rising sentiment that Francis was moving too fast or in the wrong direction or simply saying outrageous things. Shifting his torso back and forth in an effort to find the balanced way to put his answer, my friend said that Francis had a great sense of initiative but that sometimes he moved too drastically in one direction, or without taking into account procedures that exist for a reason. After a pause he added, weighing each word, \u201cThere is, there has been\u2026 a certain amount of talk of schism.\u201d In other words, there are high-ranking and increasingly outspoken discontents both within the Curia and abroad\u2014a number of U.S. bishops among them\u2014who are deeply unhappy with what they believe is the pope\u2019s betrayal of the Catholic faith; so unhappy, in fact, that, according to my friend, some are even contemplating the possibility of establishing a separate Catholicism. The man who would unite all religions in a shared belief in God\u2019s love, and who as provincial of the Argentine Jesuits so divided his order that outside intervention was required, is again proving his ability to unite and divide. The journalist from Vatican Insider, Giacomo Galeazzi, is convinced that Francis will easily prevail. \u201cHis opponents\u201d\u2014he named a handful of high-ranking members of the Curia\u2014\u201clost power with Ratzinger\u2019s resignation. The Pope is an extraordinarily free man,\u201d Galeazzi said. \u201cHe has no debts to the Curia because he comes from the outside. Those who have the power are those who occupy themselves with the periphery. The pope can do what he likes.\u201d Perhaps. But the list of urgent issues the pope faces is long, and he is neither a young nor healthy man. He is subject to \u201clittle fevers\u201d that force him to cancel more and more events. He is overworked, and 77, and many still remember the shameful spectacle of John Paul II\u2019s very public agony. The question of succession is already on everyone\u2019s mind. There is no consensus even about what the consensus is on the topic. \u201cMy understanding,\u201d said Daniel Gallagher, the Curia priest, \u201cis that at the conclave several cardinals made it clear that they did not expect another papal resignation in the future.\u201d But various other priests I talked to expressed their gratitude toward Benedict for taking an overdue step. It\u2019s possible that Francis\u2019s nonstop daily schedule, exhausting to his collaborators and most of all to himself, is motivated by his desire to follow Benedict\u2019s revolutionary precedent and take retirement. \u201cPope Benedict has made a very significant act [in retiring],\u201d the pope told the Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia recently. \u201cHe has opened the door, has created an institution, that of the eventual popes emeritus.\u00a0\u2026 I will do the same as him, asking the Lord to enlighten me when the time comes.\u201d If the general speculation is correct that if he were to retire, he would do so at the age of eighty, that would mean that he has less than three years to accomplish his revolutionary program. Unless, of course, his health issues mean that he has even less time. On my last day in Rome I took a final walk down the Borgo Pio, the narrow street in the shadow of St. Peter\u2019s that is crammed with checker-tablecloth outdoor cafes, vestment boutiques, and tatty souvenir shops. The Borgo buzzes with Anglo and Chinese tourists and Bangladeshi crazy-putty vendors. Nigerian bishops, Philippine nuns, and Mexican seminarians bustle by, wide-eyed tourists here themselves, rubbernecking, knocking on doors and hoping for an audience. To spend an hour along the Borgo is to see the world: More, perhaps, than the magnificent treasures of St. Peter\u2019s, it gives a real sense of the vast reach and ambition of the institution founded by the humble apostle Peter some two thousand years ago, and of the faith propping up that edifice. If, in an increasingly agnostic world, we in the Western world still care so much about the fate of Francis and his church, it is because the largest and arguably greatest part of the culture that nurtured that world right through the twentieth century was the creation of that church\u2014music, architecture, Protestantism, painting, early science, sculpture, our most basic social construct (one husband, one wife). For better or worse, we are all children of St. Peter\u2019s god. But his temple is creaking, springing leaks and cracks everywhere, and the host of enthusiastic priests working inside the Vatican to fix it all may or may not find a way to replace a few crumbling central columns without bringing down the entire construct. And then there is the question Francis implicitly raises in his very public statement about how the faith should be practiced: What is the relationship between the Jesus that Catholics look to for salvation and the huge edifice in Rome? \u201cI quite like the idea of a church reduced to its smallest expression,\u201d said Father Echeverry when I asked him what would happen if the pope were to die before completing the transformation he is so intent on carrying out. Or what if, despite all the pope\u2019s efforts, materialism and consumerism win the day, or the rigors of a dogmatic belief prove too much for the average person? What if science finally destroys the possibility of faith? What if the faithful no longer fill to overflowing the plaza at St. Peter\u2019s every Wednesday morning? \u201cI like the idea of going from a church that takes its strength in numbers to one about which it can be said that we truly live the Gospel,\u201d said Echeverry. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind that at all.\u201d At the end of my lunch with Father Rodr\u00edguez I asked him if he ever felt that the Catholic Church might disappear. \u201cIf it should come to pass that the church, through lack of technological, political, or economic power, or through religious wars, should come to an end, we would simply be living the experience of Jesus,\u201d Father Rodriguez said. \u201cIf the church is crucified, it will be repeating the experience of its founder. And it would leave behind something so deep as to be inextinguishable. Or how is it that [Catholicism] survived 300 years in Japan without a single priest, through the efforts of a few laymen and some women? If God was not working explicitly there, how did the church survive?\u201d In Rome these days, it seems impossible that the Catholic Church might be reduced one day to a lonely voice in the wilderness; Francis and his joyful faith inspire millions not only with a renewed belief in God but in a living and lively religion. One had just to watch him during the open-air Easter Mass in April, in which the pope and his people deployed every sign and symbol to create a beautiful spectacle of meaning: The steps of St. Peter\u2019s were transformed into a garden, deacons and lectors\u2014men and women!\u2014from Korea, Germany, China, and the Middle East read from the Bible, a chorus from the Eastern Orthodox Church sang in strange and powerful harmony, Russian patriarchs celebrated alongside Francis\u2026 and the pope looked tired and aged throughout. But he positively bounded toward the Popemobile at the end, like a child who has unexpectedly been offered his favorite peanut-butter sandwich. Refusing assistance, he climbed on energetically, as if to say, Let\u2019s go! And it was the cheering and laughing crowds and the pope\u2019s hugging and blessing ritual all over again, bathing in the People, as the Spanish saying goes, as the Popemobile wove through the ecstatic crowds.

Mercury, a naturally occurring element\u2026across the planet\u200a\u2014\u200abut the Arctic is special.

But in the Arctic, plants often do not fully decompose\u2026[and] can be remobilized again if permafrost thaws. How much would be released depends on how much the permafrost thaws\u200a\u2014\u200awhich in turn depends on the volume of greenhouse-gas emissions and subsequent warming of the planet. But permafrost thaw has begun in some places\u2026. It could flush out through rivers into the Arctic Ocean\u2026enter the atmosphere.

It was the culmination of an extraordinarily surreal week of intense international press coverage, nonstop phone and email interviews, all accompanied by my growing sense that I had not merely written a humorous spell that had gone viral, but had unknowingly assisted in the birth of something far bigger. When I first posted the text of the spell here on Medium, I assumed it might generate minor interest in the progressive pagan and magical communities, and maybe some appreciative chuckles from my network of artists and activists. Instead, with a viral rapacity that could not have existed before social networks, it exploded exponentially and became a novel, rapidly growing social movement under the umbrella hashtag #MagicResistance. Something had emerged from our shattered collective psyche as we comprehended the enormity of the unspooling Trumpian dystopia\u200a\u2014\u200aa deep and widespread desire to employ our spiritual energy as an act of resistance. Every waning crescent moon since that February evening, people around the world have gathered at a minute before midnight (US Eastern Time) to focus their consciousness in a ritualistic effort to bind Donald Trump and his kakistocratic cohorts from doing harm. Some gather in groups, but most do the ritual alone or with a significant other. Afterward, many of these witches, magicians, artists, and activists gather on Facebook and other social media to share photos of their altars (many of which are beautiful works of art in their own right) as well as their their emotions, visions, and experiences. For the majority, the spell is liberating and energizing, a reclaiming of personal power and an affirmation of their deeply held values in the face of the firehose of negativity from the White House, the GOP, and the 24/7 \u201cnews.\u201d Far from being ineffectual \u201cslacktivism,\u201d the ritual (and others developed by participants) helps many of us stay focused, committed, and invigorated for our everyday activism and resistance. It has become a spiritual balm and a monthly reminder of our committment to fighting injustice and the the ongoing dismantling of our liberal democracy. And though the term #MagicResistance is new, ritual and magical acts aimed at oppressive powers and tyrants date back to antiquity, as will be described in my upcoming book, Magic for the Resistance: Rituals and Spells for Change (Llewellyn Worldwide, Fall 2018). From Greeks and Romans of the ancient world inscribing lead tablets with binding spells against government officials, Medieval peasants creating wax effigies of hated monarchs, enslaved Africans calling to the loas in their fight for freedom in Haiti, to British witches raising a \u201ccone of power\u201d to prevent Hitler\u2019s invasion of their homeland, magic has always been employed by the common people against their oppressors. One can debate its efficacy, of course, but its tactical appeal is deep and timeless. From the beginning, it has been clear that the #MagicResistance is much bigger than Donald Trump and his crooked cabal. Trump is merely the symptom, like the eruption of a pus-filled boil, of currents that have always flowed beneath the thin veneer of social progress\u2014racism, militarism, materialism, misogyny, patriarchy, homophobia, xenophobia, and a host of other -isms and -phobias exemplifying the anti-evolutionary sicknesses of our species. Donald Trump is every boss who leers at his assistant\u2019s breasts, every bully screaming \u201cfaggot\u201d at a crying kid in the locker room, every bank manager redlining an African-American family trying to buy a home, every bigot telling a Guatemalan immigrant to \u201cspeak American or go back to where you came from,\u201d every Wall Street trader ignoring the pleading eyes of a homeless veteran, every healthcare bean counter rejecting the claim for a sick child, every pharma executive jacking up the cost of cancer drugs, every guy in a pickup truck \u201crolling coal\u201d as he passes a Prius, and every pedophile barging into a dressing room full of young women \u201cbecause he can.\u201d Our resistance is bigger than Trump, and will still be required when he is relegated to the garbage heap of failed tyrants. Authoritarianism, white supremacy, and xenophobia were globally resurgent before Trump ran for office. The richest of the rich keep taking more from everyone else, and the poor keep sinking further into misery. Accelerating climate change threatens every person, and every living creature, on our planet. Our crises are of the spirit, and require spiritual solutions. So tonight, I\u2019ll stand before my altar, alone, but knowing thousands of others are saying the same words, in unison, around our beautiful, fragile planet, dedicating themselves to the long, hard, but essential fight before us. As we say together: In the name of all who walkCrawl, swim, or flyOf all the trees, the forests,Streams, deserts,Rivers and seasIn the name of JusticeAnd LibertyAnd LoveAnd EqualityAnd Peace So mote it be.

It is exactly that\u2014a right, not a privilege\u2014and that right is at the core of what it means to be an American. To vote is to participate in the community, to act as the ultimate power in a finely balanced system of checks and balances, to establish the kind of future you want for yourself and your children. The quest for inclusivity in America is perhaps best observed through the right to vote. In the beginning, only white male landowners granted themselves that power. But eventually, through wars and protests and years of hard work, that power was extended to Black Americans, to women, to Native Americans, and to every citizen from their eighteenth birthday until the day they die. Here in Washington State, every adult who\u2019s registered to vote receives their ballot in the mail about two and a half weeks before every election day. And that\u2019s fantastic! When more people are included in the election process, we get better results from our elected leaders. Several pieces of legislation that are right now moving through the legislature in Olympia could make Washington one of the most inclusive electoral systems in the entire United States. \u201cI love democracy\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s awesome, it\u2019s exciting, it\u2019s wonderful and messy,\u201d Zach Hudgins, a state representative from the 11th District, tells me over the phone as he drives down to Olympia. Hudgins doesn\u2019t just talk a good game when it comes to democracy. He\u2019s volunteered to help ensure fair and accessible elections in the Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan, and \u201cI went to Iraq in 2004 to help the Iraqi parliament get ready for their first election,\u201d he tells me. Why would he venture to some of the world\u2019s most dangerous places to ensure someone else\u2019s right to vote? \u201cI truly believe elections work and democracy works,\u201d Hudgins says. \u201cI believe it\u2019s messy and it\u2019s unfair to the losers sometimes, but generally it\u2019s an amazing way to run a system.\u201d It\u2019s important for Hudgins that his state works as hard as possible to perfect its democracy. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to identify and break down hurdles in voter participation and increase confidence in the system,\u201d Hudgins tells me. There\u2019s no single \u201csilver bullet\u201d solution, he says, but a bipartisan team of lawmakers in Olympia have been working on a wide array of legislation to make voting more inclusive and more transparent. One example is HB 1507, a bill to enhance election reports which Hudgins worked on with a Republican from District 6, Representative Jeff Holy. And Trump-supporting Republican State Senator Kirk Pearson sponsored a law last year installing more ballot drop boxes around the state, which allow people to vote without paying for a stamp to mail their ballot. (This bipartisan drive to encourage voting isn\u2019t just a deep-blue Washington State peculiarity; even Republican-run states like Wisconsin are passing laws to promote same-day voter registration.) Hudgins is supporting and considering a number of bills, but most of them follow the same basic strategy: they transform voter registration from an opt-in system to an opt-out one. In Automatic Voter Registration (AVR) legislation that recently moved to the state Senate, any citizen who has the right to vote should be told about their right to vote at every point of contact with the government\u200a\u2014\u200aparticularly at the DoL. Nearly 80 percent of all voters are registered through motor voter laws, Hudgins explains, but the vast majority of newly licensed drivers in the state, at 16 and 17 years of age, are too young to vote. Hudgins is encouraging a solution which allows Washington residents to preregister when they get their license so that they automatically receive their first ballot in the mail after they turn 18. \u201cWhen we have low voter turnout,\u201d Hudgins says, \u201cwe get officials who are less accountable. When we have higher turnout, we have officials who are more accountable.\u201d in the end, he believes, we\u2019re making our nation more perfect by including more and more voters. It\u2019s a slow process, but one through which great things are possible. Susan Mason, the Executive Director of the criminal justice reform organization What\u2019s Next Washington, has a simple mantra to explain her policy on voting: \u201ceverybody in, nobody out!\u201d Mason explains to me that her role at What\u2019s Next is to continually remind Washington that \u201cthere\u2019s a whole section of society we set out on the edges\u200a\u2014\u200amostly poor people, and people of color.\u201d Over 15 years ago, Mason served 15 months in prison. Once she left prison in 2003 she regained her right to vote. (If you\u2019re a Washington state resident in federal prison, your right to vote is returned to you the minute you\u2019re out. If you\u2019re in Washington State prison, you have to go through probation before voting rights are restored.) But there\u2019s a big hitch: \u201cI didn\u2019t vote until this last election because I didn\u2019t know I could,\u201d Mason tells me. \u201cI could\u2019ve voted in 2009 but I didn\u2019t know. For a lot of years, I would say, \u2018I can\u2019t vote, I\u2019m a felon,\u2019 and nobody told me \u2018yes you can.\u2019\u201d Mason\u2019s experience is not unique. \u201cThere\u2019s so many of us who don\u2019t know,\u201d she says. For people who served time, she says, \u201cthe belief is that you can\u2019t vote. During the last election when we were voting for the new mayor, I had a friend who said to me \u2018I want to get my rights back and vote.\u2019 I asked her how long she\u2019d been off probation and she said 2001. She\u2019s been out forever! She could\u2019ve voted for years. This is a woman who owns a business, who had no blemishes on her record since her release. She\u2019s an amazing human being and an amazing citizen who just didn\u2019t know she had that right. \u201c \u201cThere are thousands and thousands of people in Washington State that don\u2019t know they are eligible, that they didn\u2019t lose their right to be a citizen,\u201d Mason tells me. In a more transparent system under AVR, those disenfranchised voters would be told that they\u2019re registered to vote when they update their license, or in other points of contact with the government. Oskar Zambreno at the Latino Community Fund grew up in California. \u201cMy parents brought me here when I was 2 years old,\u201d he says. Zambreno didn\u2019t learn until sixth grade, after a class discussion of then-Governor Pete Wilson\u2019s anti-immigrant Proposition 187, that he wouldn\u2019t have the right to vote as an adult if he remained undocumented. \u201cI asked my parents if they had papers and they said no. I went back to my teacher and told her my parents can\u2019t vote.\u201d Zambreno recalls telling his teacher that he felt helpless to fight Prop 187, but she reminded him that he had a voice. \u201cShe connected me with a local campaign. I started canvasing and phone banking in 6th grade. I learned the importance of voting and I learned that a lot of people who should be voting are not voting.\u201d He calls it \u201ca very personal issue,\u201d even though he\u2019s long since gained full citizenship. For Zambreno, championing laws like AVR \u201cis really about making people\u2019s voices count and giving them another option.\u201d He credits the Trump administration for unwittingly \u201cwaking up young people because we have family and friends who are undocumented.\u201d Recently, Zambreno has noticed \u201ca surge of people who wanted to go vote and they just couldn\u2019t.\u201d Preregistering young people for the vote, he says, \u201creally helps. A lot of students don\u2019t pay attention to the election until the week of the election, so having that pre-registration and same-day registration should help make voting more equitable.\u201d If you support Automatic Voter Registration, it\u2019s important that you call your state Senator and urge them to pass AVR. As my coworker Jessyn Farrell pointed out earlier this week, even if you know your representative is on your side on the issue, your calls can help them decide which issues to prioritize this session. But it\u2019s also important to remember that there\u2019s always more work to be done to include everyone in every election. All three of the people I interviewed for this piece discussed other ways to represent all of Washington, and not just the one-in-five King County residents who manage to turn in their ballots. From registration at birth to returning voting rights to prisoners to prepaid postage on mail-in ballots, there is no shortage of exciting ways to improve voter participation. It\u2019s all a part of our eternal quest to make a more perfect union. \u201cEvery time we try to fix something, we realize there\u2019s something more,\u201d Zambreno tells me. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a patch or a fix-all for this issue. We\u2019ll find other hurdles. And we\u2019ll address them when they arise.\u201d By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out. Political writer at Civic Ventures.

Remember the moments when the client was unhappy with your work or when boss could not understand the essence of your idea, although for you it seemed to be genius. And possibly it was, but only in your head. If you want your idea to be accepted and realized, you need to infect others with your vision. The founder of one famous design studio told me an interesting story. Once they were working on the concept of a website for a tender, and in the end created several brilliant layouts, which became the basis of their final presentation. Armed with coffee, designers enthusiastically headed to the client, looking forward to their success and\u00a0\u2026 failed. Instead of listening to the enchanting presentation, the client printed it on a black and white printer and began to poke into indistinct details. As a result, the work, on which team worked, sparing no MacBooks and nextdoor coffee house reserves, went down the drain. The most popular way is to say that your client is a fool and to despond, but for some reasons this option does not suit for everyone. Therefore, I will tell you how to prepare for presentations in order to increase the chances of success. And it\u2019s not so important what it is: a major tender or a small improvement. Success in both cases is based on the same things. I started my way in design as a freelancer, and only few years later I realized the importance of a proper presentation. The last two years I work on the product\u2019s side, and I have to use this skill even more often. Without a proper presentation every small improvement, will be forgotten or abandoned to the very bottom of the development tasks list. Currently I can spend more than an hour preparing the presentation, and it helps me to find all ambiguous moments and to prepare the answers in advance. I have formed these rules, basing on my personal experience of working as freelancer and on the product\u2019s side. I also added information which I received out of communication with designers from famous design teams. So, let\u2019s move on to the rules. When a client hires you, he shows that he does not understand the design and he does not know what you are actually doing. Therefore, you should explain that your job is not about creating art objects, but your assignment is to research the business goals, user needs and to study target audience and working solutions. So as a result, you will be able to convince the client that every visual solution is not based on the designer\u2019s personal preferences, but on specific facts. Don\u2019t spare your efforts for audit, as it will help you to find information that can be used during the presentation. Thanks to this, you will show your competence, which increases your chances to succeed. Observe the news of your customer\u2019s business. Do not ignore related areas. For example, when designing an airline website, you may look through the websites where you can buy tickets for the events. There you can find similar scenarios that can help you with the design. Pay special attention to the researches, since the figures given in the presentation look much more convincing than trends. I mentioned this in the previous article. The client knows nothing about design so he expects a miracle from your work. But it\u2019s almost impossible to convey your idea separately from the story that you will tell during the presentation. It is also important to understand who makes the final decision, because even if you are presenting the project in the customer\u2019s office, later your idea may be misconstrued within the company. While presenting the project personally, you can reasonably defend each design decision. If you have to explain your decision in a letter, pay attention to the tone. I prepare important letters in two stages. At first I write a draft and rewrite it several times until I understand that the narrative is constructed logically. After that I take a pause, get back to it after a while, and make corrections if it\u2019s necessary, paying attention to the logic and tone. This rule is very useful because I often felt that initially my letter sounded aggressive. In the era of instant messengers, it\u2019s more difficult for us to think before doing something. You can send a message only by pressing Enter, and you don\u2019t need to spend time and energy on thinking and editing. It\u2019s sad that this practice gets into professional communications. I think you know Slack\u2019s slogan: \u201cWhere Work Happens\u201d. I hate it because I think these services are only tools, while the work happens in your head when you work on ideas, and during communication when you share your ideas. Slack is very easy to use, but do not forget that when you chatting you don\u2019t work. When the client becomes your partner, you will reduce the probability of failure, because you make each decision together. Due to this, your final presentation will not be an exam anymore, but will become a pleasant formality, as rewarding of the winner. Working together does not mean installing Sketch on the client\u2019s Mac. Your customer knows his industry well, that\u2019s why it is an excellent source of information. Do not ask him about user needs. This is not the purpose of your communication. The customer can explain how business works currently. Your task is to determine how it will work in the future. The classic tender brief includes the main page and one or two internal pages. Do not be fooled by a provocation. Stop thinking of page numbers and show the interaction between the user and the product from the entry point to the targeted action. Surprise the client! You have to convey to the customer just one single message: your design solution is the result of deep analysis, which gave you a comprehension of his business needs. And that this solution was created, and a visual style was chosen basing on this data only. Remember that the client needs your design solution. Your presentation should not send a message like\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cI have an idea. How do you like it? \u201c. You are a competent professional. You do not need to justify yourself and wait for the approval. You just need to do your job well and present it correctly. Finally, I will give an example from the history of NeXT company. Steve Jobs needed a logo, so he came to the famous designer Paul Rand, and asked him how many options he cold provide. And Paul answered: Less than 1% of designers can afford to respond to the client in such a way, but despite this, every designer should appreciate and demonstrate his professionalism. And the only way to do it is to show how your decision will help the business to make money. The last question which remains is what to do with the designer\u2019s ego, which sometimes screams louder than his mind? It\u2019s not so difficult to deal with. Once you plunge into the problem and show the empathy for the business, the ego will disappear and your work will change forever.

Nigel, a gannet bird who lived on Mana Island off the coast of New Zealand was found dead near a decoy mate he spent years trying to court. According to an article in the Washington Post, Nigel migrated to the island in 2013, which was populated with some 80 decoy birds, meant to entice other followers. Nigel fell in love with one of the wooden birds, grooming her, building a nest for her, nuzzling her faded paint. Nigel is not alone. In the past week Quartz, The Cut, the New York Times, TIME, and The Washington Post have all published articles on loneliness. Last month Britain appointed a Minister of Loneliness to help deal with the rising rates of isolation individuals feel. Reports revealed that roughly 15 to 20 percent of British citizens regularly feel lonely. The appointment was in part a response to the 2016 murder of Jo Cox, who was killed by a man with connections to the far-right. Loneliness had been one of her primary policy issues. Prime Minister Theresa May said of the appointment: Loneliness is a problem in America, too. According to researchers from UCLA who crafted a Loneliness Scale, approximately between 20 and 43 percent of all American adults over the age of 60 experience \u201cfrequent or intense loneliness.\u201d And it is clear to researchers that loneliness has significant health impacts: Despite these statistics, Eric Klineberg, writing for this week\u2019s SundayReview, argues that loneliness is not a health epidemic. Instead he argues loneliness is a result of our contemporary society: It\u2019s clear that loneliness is intimately connected to the political moment we\u2019re living in. Klineberg\u2019s attention to changing social networks and media forms reflects that, but he is unwilling to call loneliness an epidemic, for fear that we\u2019ll end up causing social panic and not helping those in need. That seems reasonable, but I think in making that judgment he misses the larger political implication of calling loneliness an epidemic. The rise of populism in the United States, a pervasive sense of social disconnection, the surge in suicide rates, the continuing drug epidemic, the fear of immigrants, are all interconnected. It is not surprising that loneliness is appearing at this moment as a Western problem. Loneliness, as a condition of modernity, has always posed a threat to democracy. And right now, democracy is suffering. When people feel cast out, unable to connect and find meaning, they often turn toward social movements or ideological leaders in order to become a part of something. Theodor Adorno called this the \u201cAmerican Joiner Mentality.\u201d Hannah Arendt argued that loneliness was the breeding ground for totalitarianism. It\u2019s ironic in a way that since the election of Donald Trump, Hannah Arendt\u2019s epic work The Origins of Totalitarianism has been selling at record rates. Most people are drawn to the work despite its bulk because it offers an understanding of totalitarianism as an emergent political force in the world. What they don\u2019t expect to find at the very end is a careful analysis of loneliness in relation to the rise of mass social movements. Arendt understood the political threat that loneliness poses to the fabric of a plural society. She called it \u201cthe common ground of terror.\u201d At the end of Origins, she writes: Anti-democratic forces like the new waves of populism we are experiencing in the United States and throughout Europe thrive on loneliness, appealing to those who feel as if they have no place within society. With the collapse of society, individuals find themselves increasingly isolated. Today, technology and the disintegration of the public realm continue to alienate people from one another and the world, empowering political leaders like Donald Trump. This is why throughout her writing Arendt emphasizes that we must share the world in common, embracing one another in our plurality and difference. Feeling at home in the world, having a sense of social life, as well as private and public, is essential to what it means to be human. Loneliness is as much a threat to liberal democracy as any other political force we can imagine.

They don\u2019t have the desire to become better themselves so they can proactively improve their own circumstances. Unlike most people, who simply wait and wish for luck, you can seek to become the kind of person equipped with the skills and abilities to do brilliant things. You can become the kind of person who does highly influential work. Your work can solve pressing problems, improve people\u2019s lives, and get noticed by important people who share your work not for your sake, but for theirs! Sharing your work makes them look good because of how great it is. The quality of who you are as a person, and the work you do, is completely within your control. But you can\u2019t wish for it to happen. You must become the kind of person who naturally attracts the success you seek. Here\u2019s how: If you don\u2019t pay for something, you rarely pay attention. Most people want stuff that\u2019s free. But if you get something for free, you rarely prize that thing. You rarely take it seriously. How much do you invest in yourself? How committed are you to youself? If you aren\u2019t investing in yourself, than you don\u2019t have any skin in the game of your own life. If you aren\u2019t invested in your business, you probably won\u2019t do high quality work. If you\u2019re not invested in your relationships, you\u2019re probably more focused on what you can get than what you can give. When it comes to self-improvement, investing 10% of your income on yourself will yield a 100X or more return on that investment. For every dollar you spend on your education, skills, and relationships, you\u2019ll get at least 100 dollars back in returns. If you want to do something extremely well, you need to surround yourself with the right mentors. Anything that you\u2019ll ever do well will be the result of high quality mentoring. If you suck at something, it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t received quality mentoring in that thing. The best mentorships are the ones where you pay your mentor. Often, the more you pay the better, because you\u2019ll take the relationship far more seriously. You won\u2019t solely be taking in that relationship. You won\u2019t purely be a consumer. Instead, you\u2019ll be invested, and as such, you\u2019ll listen more carefully. You\u2019ll care more. You\u2019ll be more thoughtful and engaged. There will be higher consequences for not succeeding. I invested $3,000 to get help writing my first book proposal from a highly successful writer. That $3,000 got me maybe 4 or 5 hours of his time. But in those 4 or 5 hours, he taught me what I needed to know to create an amazing book proposal. He provided me resources that dramatically enhanced and sped up my process. With his help, I was able to get a literary agent and eventually a multi six figure book contract. Had I been overly concerned about the $3,000, I\u2019m confident that to this day, I\u2019d still not have written a book proposal. At the very most, I\u2019d have written a terrible one. I would not have been as motivated or invested, so I would have been far more likely to procrastinate needed action. If you don\u2019t have much money, surely you can afford to buy a book. How much money and time do you spend on entertainment, clothes, or food? It\u2019s a matter of priority. It\u2019s only when you invest in something that you have the motivation to make it happen. Beyond mentorships, you should invest in education programs such as online courses, books, quality products such as food and sleep. Your level of success can generally be directly measured by your level of investment. If you\u2019re not getting the results you want, it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t invested enough to get those results. Your number 1 investment must be yourself. Who you are determines: Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll find when you financially invest yourself in something. You become very committed to that thing. Economists call this sunk cost bias. But you can leverage this to your benefit. If you want to escalate your personal commitment to something, invest heavily in that thing. Eventually, it will become a point of no return. You\u2019ll become so fiercely committed that withdrawing will seem ridiculous. Hence, you\u2019ll need to truly know WHAT you want and WHY (see #14 below). If you don\u2019t know these things, then over-committing could be a huge and irrational problem. However, if you are certain about WHO you are/want to be, WHAT you want, and WHY, then you need to invest yourself. Most people are consumers rather than creators. They are at work to get their paycheck, not to make a difference. When left to their own devices, most people consume their time as well. It is only by investing your time that you get a return on that time. Nearly every second spent on social media is consumed time. You can\u2019t have that time back. Rather than making your future better, it actually made your future worse. Just like eating bad food, every consumed moment leaves you worse off. Every invested moment leaves you better off. Entertainment is all well and good. But only when that entertainment is an investment in your relationships or yourself. You\u2019ll know if it was an investment if that entertainment continues to yield returns over and over in your future. That may include positive memories, transformational learning, or deepened relationships. Even still, life isn\u2019t purely about being entertained. Education and learning is also key. And although both are essential, education will provide far greater returns in your future. The world\u2019s most successful people are intense learners. They are hard readers. They know that what they know determines how well they see the world. They know that what they know determines the quality of relationships they can have and the quality of work they can do. If you are constantly consuming junk media, how can you possibly expect to create high value work? Your input directly translates to your output. Garbage in, garbage out. Just as a large majority of your down-time should be spent learning, so should a great deal of your \u201cworking\u201d time. Wealthy and happy people work to learn. Unsuccessful and unhappy people work primarily for money. Only 20% of your energy should be spent doing your actual work. The rest should be spent learning, improving yourself, and resting. It is by \u201csharpening your saw\u201d that you\u2019ll continue to become a better and more capable person. Thus, as you dedicate large portions of time becoming a better thinker, communicator, and better at your craft, the quality of your work will continue to increase. Eventually, you\u2019ll be able to charge VERY VERY high fees for your work, because no one else can do it like you. When you prioritize learning and recovery, then during the hours you are actually working, you\u2019ll be in a deep flow state. You won\u2019t be distracted like most people are when they work. You\u2019re either 100% on or 100% off. While working, you can get more done in a few hours than most people get done in a number of days. Your time is spent well because your priorities are clear, you\u2019re well-rested, and your mind is stimulated. In our media and information age, there are a million things you could learn. But if you don\u2019t put that learning into immediate practice, it becomes shallow information. Information and knowledge are two very different things. Knowledge and wisdom are also two very different things. It takes wisdom to determine what you should learn, why you should learn it, and when you should learn it. Unless you\u2019re invested, you probably won\u2019t learn with the intensity needed to maximize that knowledge. Unless you understand the value of your time, you probably won\u2019t have the discernment to ignore almost everything while learning that which will bring the highest return. When you learn something, you should get a return on that learning. Far too many people read books now just to say they\u2019ve read lots of books. If you\u2019re not applying what you\u2019re learning, your consuming and wasting your time. Very few people create true wealth. Even those who have high incomes are not truly wealthy. Most people\u2019s lifestyles match their incomes. When they make more, they consume more. In fact, most people make money solely to consume. Very few people make money to invest that money. It\u2019s best to think of your business as only 1/2 of your income equation. You have your business which brings income. Then, you have your investment entity to turn your income into even more money. Like anything, how well you manage your money is determined by how well mentored you are. If you want to become brilliant with money, invest in education and mentoring. The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The best time to start investing was also in the past. If you haven\u2019t started yet, don\u2019t sit and wallow in regret. Tomorrow doesn\u2019t exist for people who don\u2019t do something today. Start today. Get yourself educated. Create a vehicle, or several vehicles, where you put at least 10% of your income. Eventually, your investment vehicle may even start producing more profits for you than your actual business. Compound interest is a real thing. If you put 10% of your income into your investments over a long enough period of time, you\u2019ll be set. Unlike the majority of high earners out there, you\u2019ll be able to STOP WORKING whenever you want, because your money is making more than enough money for you to comfortably live with. Most people are only focused on what they can get out of life. Me, me, me. However, once you become more consciously awake to the world, your desire will shift from merely receiving to giving. You\u2019ll realize that it\u2019s actually far more satisfying to give than to get.Moreover, you\u2019ll be driven by a cause you fully believe in. The truth is, you really only have 1 of 2 orientations towards people (and life). Either you are in relationships as TRANSACTIONS, or as TRANSFORMATIONS. Most people have transactional relationships. They\u2019re focused only on what they get out of the relationship. It\u2019s all about furthering their own agenda. It\u2019s rooted in scarcity. It\u2019s selfish. This isn\u2019t how you get far in relationships and life. It\u2019s also how you get stuck in your own small-mindedness. Transformational relationships, on the other hand, are completely focused on giving and gratitude\u200a\u2014\u200athe hallmarks of abundance. In these relationships, the whole becomes more than the sum of parts. Both parties, in vulnerability and trust, transcend their own small-mindedness and become something more. At the core, this requires being a giver, not a taker. As Adam Grant has explained in his book, Give and Take, when two givers come together, the results are astronomical. Here\u2019s a pro-tip: don\u2019t surround yourself with takers. When your motivation is to give, you\u2019ll often get insights about how you can improve your relationships. Random thoughts will pop into you head to send \u201cThank you\u201d texts to various people. You\u2019ll have more ideas about how you can improve other people\u2019s lives and businesses. You\u2019ll start contributing more, which will lead to far more opportunities and deeper relationships. People will come to love and trust you. Your work will be motivated by a higher cause and thus will be far more inspired and impactful. Just because your primary motivation is to give, doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t also seek a lot of help. Actually, you are constantly seeking and receiving help. The truth is, everyone is highly dependent on other people to do what they do. But it takes wisdom and humility to openly acknowledge that dependence. Rather than seeing it as a weakness, realize that it\u2019s a strength. Beyond acknowledging your dependence, constantly express your appreciation to the people in your life. That which you appreciate, appreciates. Relationships are assets that can and should grow bigger and better over time. As the brilliant entrepreneur Michael Fishman has said, \u201cSelf-made is an illusion. There are many people who played divine roles in you having the life that you have today. Be sure to let them know how grateful you are.\u201d If you don\u2019t appreciate and give to your relationships, your relationships will suffer. All relationships are like bank accounts, and if one person is constantly depositing and the other person is constantly withdrawing, eventually all of the resources become depleted. In such relationships, 1+1=less than 2. Conversely, in synergistic and healthy relationships, 1+1= far more than 2. When two people are continually giving and receiving, the relational bank account continues to grow and expand, providing several intended and unintended benefits. For example, I was recently at the gym with my brother. At the beginning of the workout, he was struggling mentally. He wasn\u2019t adding to my energy and helping my workout become better than if I was alone, but instead, he was sucking my energy and requiring me to exert more energy and effort than if I was alone. I made him aware of what was happening, and he immediately shifted his emotional posture. He realized how dramatically his mood was impacting me. His motivation shifted from consuming an experience to creating something great. Our shared mental state heightened, taking us into group flow. Our workout become far superior to anything I could create on my own. Not only that, but we began to engage in inspired conversation. This led to brilliant insights and connections that were relevant to the book I\u2019m writing. The amazing workout was the intended outcome of our synergy. The insights for my book were unintended benefits. This can only happen when both parties are actively giving and receiving from the relationship. Where both are focusing on creating rather than consuming. Where both have the primary motivation of helping the other person succeed. Most people are in a state of competition rather than collaboration. Collaboration is a much higher level than competition. Competition is focused on the self. It\u2019s also very low level thinking, because what you can do on your own is very limited. People who are competing are grinding. They\u2019re more focused on winning than creating real solutions. However, when your thinking becomes expanded, you realize you could do so much more with other people. Collaboration creates unique connections working by yourself never could. You have skills and knowledge that are awesome in your field. There are other people in different fields who have skills and knowledge completely outside of your current awareness. These people also have assets you don\u2019t have. If you want to get 10X or 100X the results of other people in your field, you need to develop strategic \u201cwin-win\u201d partnerships. This generally happens when you devise a plan where your skill sets and assets merge with the skill sets and assets of someone else. What you can do well, someone else may struggle with. What you struggle with, others can do extremely well. Who can you partner with that could speed your process? Who has assets and resources you don\u2019t? How could you help these people? What types of partnerships could you develop, that would allow you to more quickly achieve your goals and help them more quickly achieve theirs? When you collaborate with other people, 1+1=more than 2. The whole becomes DIFFERENT from the sum of it\u2019s parts. This is how TRANSFORMATION occurs. Only those who engage in collaboration actually experience true transformation. People who only work well by themselves are stuck in their own narrow worldview and agendas. When you merge with others, your ideas and goals change. They become bigger and better. They become DIFFERENT from what you could ever create on your own. The only way to have these types of partnerships is to think long-term. You must be invested and have skin in the game. It can\u2019t be transactional. It\u2019s can\u2019t be this for that. It must be about something a lot deeper. When it is, you\u2019ll have far more integrity in the work you do. You\u2019ll express greater appreciation. You\u2019ll consistently do the right thing, even if that right thing is difficult and uncomfortable. Don\u2019t seek transactional relationships. Only seek long-term TRANSFORMATIONAL relationships. Look at your current goals. Why is that your metric for \u201csuccess\u201d? Why is that your target? What would happen if, in all seriousness, you 10X\u2019d that target? What if rather than earning $3,000/month, you pursued $30,000/month? Is that even possible? Of course it\u2019s possible. There\u2019s several people doing it. The only difference between them and you is their education, relationships, and strategy. When you set a 10X goal, you\u2019re required to think very differently about your daily behaviors. You\u2019re required to be more serious in all aspects of your life. You\u2019re required to eliminate limiting thinking and consumptive distractions. Setting a 10X goal will be one of the best things you\u2019ve ever done for yourself. This goal should be created while you are in a peak state. You get into a peak state by doing something powerful, whether that be exercising, learning, or being in a unique environment, such as a foreign country. You can even get into a peak state by being around certain types of people, the ones who inspire you to be the best version of yourself. Only you know what gets you into a peak and passionate state. So, do whatever it is that gets you there, and then write down your goals. Declare what you\u2019re going to do. Then write that goal down and visualize it\u2019s achievement every single day until it becomes your reality. When you think about this goal, don\u2019t deviate from the natural flow of ideas that follow. You can\u2019t 10X your results by engaging in the same thinking and behaviors you\u2019re currently performing. Consequently, while thinking about your goal, you\u2019ll also get ideas about what you need to do, realistically, to achieve that goal. Chances are, you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know. So you\u2019ll need to start really educating yourself about how you could conceivably achieve your goal.You\u2019ll need to get bolder about the work you\u2019re doing. You\u2019ll need to create more, and fail more. Over and over, in fact. Quantity is often the fastest path to quality. Not only that, but when you think about your 10X goal, you\u2019ll probably have ideas that scare you. When you do work that scares you, you cross a boundary that most people never cross. Scary work is often highly profitable and valuable work. Marketing is nothing more than applied psychology. It\u2019s about connecting with people, persuading them, and helping them. Many people think marketing is a nasty or immoral thing. Many \u201cartists\u201d don\u2019t learn marketing because they don\u2019t want to \u201csell out.\u201d They want their work to be pure. Academics are not better. Their work is not accessible to the common man. Marketing is nothing more than making your work easier and better to find and use. People aren\u2019t magically going to appear and buy your stuff. People aren\u2019t going to magically appear and read your stuff. Even right now: How did you land on this page? Look at the title of this article. I could have just as easily called it, \u201cAdvice for becoming successful.\u201d But would you have clicked on that article? Probably not. But you clicked on this one. Why did you click on this one? How did you get this far down? Think about the experience. Marketing is the \u201cHOW\u201d to whatever it is you do. The reason most people aren\u2019t successful is because they either fear or avoid marketing. For the same reason, most people are bad teachers. They\u2019re more focused on content than the delivery and design of that content. But the delivery\u200a\u2014\u200athe HOW\u200a\u2014\u200ais just as important IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT than WHAT you\u2019re doing or WHY you\u2019re doing it. You could have the cure for cancer. But if you don\u2019t market it well, you\u2019ll never get your cure out there. You could have the world\u2019s most important message, or greatest story, but no one will see it if you don\u2019t promote and package it intelligently. Founder of the exclusive entrepreneurial coaching platform, Strategic Coach, Dan Sullivan distinguishes between those who are in the \u201cTime-and-Effort Economy\u201d with those who are in the \u201cResults Economy.\u201d If you\u2019re in the time and effort economy, you are focused on being busy. You actually believe the amount of time and energy you put into something merits praise. Conversely, when you are in the results economy, you are only focused on achieving a specific result. The bottom line is what matters, and thus, it becomes very important to find the most effective way to get there. This is a key difference between entrepreneurs and employees. As Sullivan says: Most people don\u2019t think in terms of results because their security is in a paycheck. However, when you shift your focus from how little you can do to how much you can do, you change how you work. You start learning ways to accomplish more faster. You take on greater responsibility. You change your environment. And you also realize just how important sleep and rest are to achieving the highest possible results. Hence, you begin to take more and more time off and rest. When you dedicate 80 percent of your energy to rest and self-improvement, then you have a lot of fodder and a very sharp saw to use during the time you\u2019re actually working. You\u2019re thinking 10X bigger than everyone else. You\u2019re operating under short timelines and high pressure. You can tax yourself to extremes while you work because you spend lots and lots of time resting and preparing. The environments you work in should reflect the work you\u2019re doing. Doing several types of work in the same environment is ineffective. But people do it all the time. They sit in the same seat and mentally shift from one task to another. A far better approach is to BATCH your activities and to do those activities in a relevant environment. For example, when I write a blog post, I work in a quiet library where I have no distractions. Because my environment facilitates quality writing, and because I knew I\u2019d be writing that day, I write a lot. It\u2019s easier to write 2\u20135 blog posts in one sitting than to try writing one post at a time. Ari Meisel, author and entrepreneur, batches his activities and alternates his environments to match the work he\u2019s doing. On days he is recording podcasts, he goes to a studio and records about 5 podcast episodes in a single session. On other days, he spends his whole day in meetings or on calls. He does this work at his friend\u2019s apartment because it\u2019s a much more engaging environment. He also does a lot of writing, and does that at the SOHO HOUSE in New York City, because it\u2019s a quiet environment with poor internet connection. The lack of connection stops him from surfing the web and even using his phone, because he has bad reception. Success and wealth are not all about money. There are a lot of people who have money and have little \u201ccapital\u201d in the other key areas of their lives. Money, obviously, is very important. It solves a lot of problems. It\u2019s speeds processes. But money is a tool. It\u2019s a means to an end. For those engaging in work they truly believe in, money is simply a tool for doing more work. What is your WHY for what you\u2019re doing or pursuing? How could you possibly know your why? More importantly, how could you know your REAL WHY? It\u2019s actually quite simple. But it takes some radical honestly. There\u2019s an exercise I\u2019ll walk you through to get to your WHY. And more importantly, once you know your deepest WHY for what you\u2019re doing, you should operate FROM THAT STATE, not from your lower and base-level reasons. When trying to understand why you do something, it\u2019s better to ask \u201cWhat\u201d questions then \u201cWhy\u201d questions, because \u201cWhy\u201d questions tend to put people on the defensive. Here\u2019s a solid question you could ask yourself to understand your WHY. What about ______________ is important to you? Let\u2019s say you want to start a business, or get a new cellphone, or go to the gym\u2026 It could be big or small. But put that thing in there. What about \u201cgoing to the gym\u201d is important to you? Then, you just write the first thing that comes to your mind: because I like feeling good. Then you take your answer, and put it in the same question: What about ______________ is important to you? So, given the previous answer: What about \u201cfeeling good\u201d is important to you? A simple way to structure this exercise is shown in the images just below. So, you want to try to go 7-layers deep. Once you get to layers 5, 6, and 7, you\u2019re going to have to be really honest with yourself. Usually, you can answer layers 1\u20134 with your head. However, if you\u2019re being really honest with yourself, and I mean REALLY HONEST, you\u2019ll need to come from your heart to answer layers 5\u20137. It\u2019s at the deepest levels that you\u2019ll discover your TRUE WHY for what you\u2019re doing. Even if that something is as simple as getting a new cellphone or going to the gym. But you want to remind yourself of your DEEPEST WHY when you\u2019re doing something. And you want to operate from THAT LEVEL, because at your deepest level, you\u2019ll be operating from your heart, not your head. Thus, your performance will be much deeper, more authentic, and powerful. The stakes will be higher. Suddenly, you\u2019re not just going to the gym to \u201cfeel good,\u201d but because you have a higher calling to perform and need to be as healthy as possible to make it happen (or whatever your deepest WHY is). Your DEEPEST why will almost always expose something very personal about you, and about your fundamental beliefs about life. You want to be aware of these things, and how/why they drive you to do what you\u2019re doing. If you truly go through this exercise in a genuine way, you should get some mental and emotional breakthroughs. You should discover something about yourself, and why you are the way you are, and why you\u2019re pursuing the specific things you are. Know your why. Then act from the DEEPEST and most powerful WHY you have. You\u2019ll be far more brilliant at what you do. In order to be successful, you must believe in something. You must have a stand. All successful people and brands have a clear WHY. As Simon Sinek explains in his book, Start With Why, people don\u2019t buy what you sell, they buy why you sell it. Apple is a great example. In all of their marketing, they don\u2019t explain the technicalities of their products, they define and share their core values. They believe technology should be both easy to use and cool. If you want to be compelling and interesting, you must truly believe in something. You must have a clear stand. That stand becomes your brand. It becomes your trademark. It becomes how you distinguish yourself from others. When you have a clear stand and brand, you stand out. You are no longer neutral. You believe in something, and are fighting to make a specific change. As a result, people will either love you or hate you. That\u2019s what you want. Lukewarm means you have nothing to say. Lukewarm means you\u2019re trying to appeal to everyone. The riches are in the niches. Your niche is your audience. They are a small group of people who agree with the stand you\u2019re trying to make. They are your evangelists. If you try to appeal to everyone, your message, marketing, and products will be terrible. You won\u2019t be clear on your why, and neither will anyone else. Thus, you\u2019ll be average like everyone else and your work won\u2019t stand out. Only people with firm stands get really really good at marketing. They care enough about their message to get it out there. They realize that the HOW is just as important as the WHAT and WHY. Are you doing these 15 things? How aggressively are you doing them?

I switched to a Galaxy S8 months ago and I don\u2019t see myself going back to iPhone, even the X. The iPhone is dead to me. Here\u2019s why. On my iPhone 6+, most apps crash on first open. Apps freeze for 5\u201310 seconds whenever launched or switched to. I lose 3\u20134%/min on my battery and Apple Support insists that my battery is perfectly healthy. I went through \u201capps using significant power\u201d and uninstalled most of them. On top of all of this, it was recently discovered that Apple is intentionally degrading the user experience based on your battery quality. Yes, they\u2019re releasing a software update to give transparency to users and reducing the cost of a battery replacement (which is on a months-long backlog\u200a\u2014\u200amore on Apple support later), but it feels like planned obsolescence and they\u2019re just trying to avoid losing a class-action lawsuit. The video app is busted. Many times I record a video and all I see is a zero-second-long black frame saved. I\u2019ve given up on taking photos because the camera app takes forever to start up and has seconds of shutter lag. This phone worked just fine three years ago. The minimal benefits of the previous iOS updates are far outweighed by the horrible user experience it\u2019s created. I have the original Moto X (from 2013) and it still runs buttery smooth. This isn\u2019t related to my previous iPhone, but it illustrates the lack of quality of Apple. Recently, a bottom rubber foot on my MacBook came off. It was still under AppleCare so I took it into the store, my first time to the Apple Genius Bar. They told me that AppleCare wouldn\u2019t cover the replacement because it was cosmetic. How the rubber foot isn\u2019t part of the laptops utility is astonishing. When you typed on it, it would wobble. To fix it, the entire bottom chassis had to be replaced, which would cost $250. I told the Apple rep that I was surprised and I\u2019d call Apple Care later. I asked him to file a ticket for tracking and he replied that he had. Later, I called Apple Care and they assured me that the replacement was covered. They also said they didn\u2019t find a ticket in the system from the Apple rep that I had spoken to earlier. I had to go back into the store to get a rep to look at the physical laptop again and verify the foot was missing. Frustrated, I asked them to call the original store I had visited to confirm. They agreed and eventually confirmed it. Before this, I had asked them to send the part to an Apple store that was closer to my house and not the original Apple store that I had visited. A week later, I received a call confirming the part had arrived at the store furthest away. Surprised, I asked them to send it to the other store (which was ~15 miles away). They said that they\u2019d have to send it back to the warehouse and then the other store would have to order the part. A week later, the other store finally receives the part. I visited the store, they took my laptop, and I waited a couple of hours to replace the bottom. The rep came back with the laptop telling me that it\u2019s ready. I inspected the bottom and the rubber foot was still missing. Confused, he sent the laptop back. The rep returned five minutes later with a new chassis, fixing the rubber foot. So not only had they somehow not repaired the bottom originally, in reality, it only takes a tech five minutes to repair it, not hours. The cascading incompetence at Apple support was mind-blowing. Related to the battery issue above, if you try to replace your battery you\u2019re facing months-long delays. On top of that, you have to mail your phone in or take it into a store, with both options facing the risk that you\u2019re without a phone for as much as a week. Who can really live without their phone that long? Is this incompetence or intentionally meant to drive people away from replacing their batteries? Even the iPhone X feels dated compared to the S8. This is much more of a personal opinion, but the S8 feels damn sexy in your hand. When I watch a movie, the true blacks of the OLED screen just blend into the body. It feels like a bezel-less phone from a science fiction movie. Whereas the iPhone\u2019s design still separates the screen from the chassis with bezels. More objectively, even though it was released after the S8, the screen on the iPhone X isn\u2019t as good. It\u2019s lower resolution and it has more bezel. Here are the specs: Galaxy S8\u20135.8-inch Super AMOLED, 2960 x 1440 pixels (570 ppi pixel density), 1000 nits, 83.6% screen-to-body ratio vs iPhone X\u200a\u2014\u200a5.8-inch 18.5:9 True Tone OLED, 2436 x 1125 pixels (458 ppi), 625 nits, 82.9%, screen-to-body ratio. Plus, iPhone X has that notch. As a developer, I abhor it. As a user, it\u2019s annoying to have wasted space when, for example, I\u2019m browsing the web. Not only is S8 a better phone than iPhone X, it\u2019s significantly cheaper. I just bought my S8 and a 256GB SD card for less than $700. The equivalent iPhone X would have cost me $1,252, plus another $10 for a dongle to use my headphones. That\u2019s nearly the price of two S8s. Where to start? Here\u2019s an incomplete list in no particular order. On Android, you can install apps that automatically update your wallpaper, change your entire app launcher (I\u2019m using Evie) including a dedicated search bar, start Google Now by swiping up, handle your SMS. Also custom phone dialers, Facebook Messenger chat heads, Samsung Edge (surprisingly I like this feature). You can even download apps outside of the app store. Did I mention that Google Photos actually always syncs in the background? Versus the iPhone, where you need to open it every 10 minutes to make sure it\u2019s syncing. Custom keyboards are reliable, whereas on iOS they still crash randomly. iOS doesn\u2019t offer any of this because they restrict what developers can build. Even if you eliminate all of the \u201cpower user\u201d features above, I think the S8, and Android broadly, is a better choice for the average user. Google is just hands down better at search, including things that you would imagine Siri would be good at by now, like dictation. I think everyone already agrees with this point, so moving on. Apple has generally been a fast-follow copier, perfecting features that have already been released. Lately they\u2019ve just felt like a slow follower that has the same or fewer features. For example, Samsung devices have had wireless charging for a while now and Apple is just catching up with the same feature set. The charging speed is the same. Samsung is also experimenting with fascinating things like VR and DeX. Are they perfect? No. But I also don\u2019t believe that Apple is capable of swooping in and perfecting them now. Apple\u2019s \u201cnew and innovative features\u201d aren\u2019t impressive either. Animoji could be done with a standard camera, but they\u2019re locked to the iPhone X. It\u2019s pure marketing to sell more Xs. I\u2019ve had force touch for years now and have never used it. And the list goes on. I\u2019m putting my money where my mouth is and buying Android devices until Apple steps its game up.

Maybe she is sitting at an outdoor cafe, her phone held out in front of her like a gilded hand mirror, a looking glass linked to an Instagram account. Maybe she tilts her head one way and then another, smiling and smirking, pushing her hair around, defiantly staring into the lens, then coyly looking away. She takes one shot, then five, then 25. She flips through these images, appraising them, an editrix putting together the September issue of her face; she weighs each against the others, plays around with filters and lighting, and makes a final choice. She pushes send and it\u2019s done. Her selfie is off to have adventures without her, to meet the gazes of strangers she will never know. She feels excited, maybe a little nervous. She has declared, in just a few clicks, that she deserves, in that moment, to be seen. The whole process takes less than five minutes. Shot Two: Zoom in on a group of people watching this woman, one table over. They are snickering, rolling their eyes, whispering among themselves. Maybe they are older than she is, making jokes about Narcissus and the end of civilization as we know it. Maybe they are all men, deeply affronted by a woman looking at herself with longing, a woman who is both the see-er and the seen, the courier of her own message. Maybe they are a group of chattering women, who have internalized a societal shame about taking pleasure in one\u2019s face in public, who have learned to be good girls, to never let their self-regard come off as a threat. Maybe they are lonesome and hungry for connection, projecting their own lack of community onto this woman\u2019s solo show, believing her to be isolated rather than expansive. They don\u2019t see where her image is headed, where it will take up space in the infinite. This is scary for them, this lack of control, this sense that her face could go anywhere, pop up anywhere. This is why they sneer at her like she is masturbating. This is why they believe that no selfie could ever mean anything other than vanity. This is why they think selfies are a phase, something they can wish away. Whoever they are, and for whatever reason they hate selfies, they are wrong. Whenever I think about selfies, I think about the women who came before. I think about the ones who never got to use front-facing cameras, that technological ease and excess that we have so quickly taken for granted. I think about Julia Margaret Cameron, who got her first camera as a gift, in 1863, when she was 48 years old. Her daughter gave it to her, a toy to stave off the solitude of aging. The machine must have felt electric in her hands. See, Julia wasn\u2019t really a head-turner. We know this from her great-niece, Virginia Woolf, who wrote that Julia was an ugly duckling in a family full of cameo complexions; her nickname was \u201cTalent,\u201d where her sisters got to be called \u201cBeauty.\u201d Cameron became instantly obsessed with photography and dove into her second act. She made hundreds of silver albumen prints, practicing and practicing in a kind of fever dream until she had created a unique method of applying a soft, dewy focus to her portraits of British celebrities. In front of her lens, Cameron made everyone look gauzy, beautiful, ethereal. She copyrighted her technique, sold prints to museums, and wrote myth-making prose about her process in her memoirs: Julia took only a few pictures of herself, and in them she looks far less imposing than her subjects, who were usually stoic, grizzled male intellectuals or creamy-cheeked actresses and debutantes. In her own portraits, she looks glum, dejected, staring at the ground or into the lens with a withering squint, as if she cannot believe she is doing this. Her self-portraits contain sighs. Vintage cameras had long exposure times, requiring the sitter to hold the same expression forever. I don\u2019t know why Julia chose to glower, but if I had to guess, I would think she knew she could grimace for a full hour. It was an expression she was used to. The type of camera Julia used wasn\u2019t made for experiments; each snap was a big commitment. We aren\u2019t bound by her constraints now, with our ability flood our clouds with unlimited smirks, kissy pouts, tongue waggles, goofy winks, and come-hither stares. When we can take endless shots from endless angles, we start to discover dimensions of ourselves we never even knew were there. That girl in the park taking selfie after selfie after selfie? She\u2019s investigating her own silhouette. She\u2019s figuring out which parts of her face she loves; she\u2019s doing confidence fact-finding. Sometimes it takes a hundred selfies to capture the one that rings out with recognition: this, this is who I am. Julia didn\u2019t have the bandwidth to focus on herself until she felt like she could smile. But we do. I think about Marian Hooper Adams, who went by Clover, the society doyenne of post-Civil War D.C. Clover and her husband, writer Henry Adams, lived across from the White House in a grand, creaky manse, where she played hostess to intellectuals and diplomats as they came through town. In their sitting room, Henry was king, while Clover played subservient wife, as women of the time were expected to do. No matter that she was extremely educated, the daughter of a prominent doctor and a Transcendental poetess. She was expected to stay quiet and erase herself, a smiling woman with a polished silver tray. But upstairs, in her little room, she worked with colloidal silver, and there, Clover was queen of her domain. She started taking photographs as a side hobby in 1883 (Henry would never let her go pro with it), collecting pictures of her friends and family and the politicians that flowed through her house, the ones she wasn\u2019t really supposed to talk to all that much. Instead, she used her photographs to communicate, to make some sense of her surroundings, to speak about her isolation. She wrote extremely technical notes about her work; her avocation became her calling. She took a devastating portrait of her in-laws, who barely spoke to her, their scowls barely concealing their grumpy disdain. Whenever she shot herself, she blocked out her face with a giant hat or some other prop; sometimes she was just a blurry smudge darting across the frame. I think even in these moments of silent communion with the camera, Clover was trying to grapple with how unseen she was, how little she felt she deserved to show herself. For a socialite, she didn\u2019t have much of a social network of her own. She had no one to share her face with, and so she kept it to herself like a secret. One day, two years after she started taking pictures, Clover killed herself in front of her bedroom fire. She was only 42. She swallowed potassium cyanide, the agent she used to develop her photographs. After her death, Henry would destroy all of Clover\u2019s letters and write her out of his autobiography; he almost managed to make her disappear. But somehow, her photographs survived. If I could go back and climb upstairs to her studio, I would tell her to show her face. If you ever feel scared to take your portrait and push it out to your feed, let me urge this: don\u2019t focus on your anxiety, focus on all the Clovers, on all the women who felt the heat of a camera in their hands but were cut off from sharing with the world, who burned silently and alone for the chance to connect. I think about Francesca Woodman; the lovely, doomed Francesca, the daughter of two bohemian artists, a plaintive blonde who spent summers in Italy and learned to take photographs of herself in an old farm house. She started noodling around with a camera when she was only 14 in 1972, fully committing herself to her work when she went off to study at RISD three years later. She sent her shots to fashion houses and magazines, but couldn\u2019t really get much traction; she applied for grants and residencies with mixed results. She was in such a rush to become a success that any slowness in the process felt like a deep insult. Her depression rolled in like an unshakable fog. She tried to kill herself once, then again, and in 1981, when she was only 22, she succeeded by leaping out of a window of a building on the East Side of Manhattan. What made Francesca different than Clover\u200a\u2014\u200agive or take a hundred years\u200a\u2014\u200awas that she actively inserted her own face and nakedness into her work, she made over 10,000 negatives demanding to be seen by someone, anyone. Looking at her work is like seeing someone discover and then delight in her own body, how far she could push it, how weird she could get, alone in a room with a roll of film. Sometimes Francesca shot herself as drowning in a river like a wet rat, or screaming, or holding a sharp knife while she bared one breast to the camera. Sometimes she showed herself disfigured by tight clothing, sometimes she bounced around in oversized dresses, exploring the space of a giant, empty, room. She played with exposure times\u200a\u2014\u200aat the end of her life she was playing with such a slow shutter speed that she had to sit in front of her lens for hours\u200a\u2014\u200ashe was interested in her body as a vessel of both life and decay, of something vitally here and then suddenly gone. She sometimes referred to her work as \u201cghost pictures.\u201d Since her work came back in vogue\u200a\u2014\u200aa documentary, a book, an exhibition, a feminist re-appraisal\u200a\u2014\u200amany are quick to view Francesca\u2019s work in light of her death, to say that she was actively trying to cancel herself out by isolating parts of her body in the frames, that her self-portraits were angry momento mori. This is likely a mistake: those who knew her described Francesca as extremely ambitious; she wrote in her journals in the third person, she saw herself from the outside as someone heading for greatness. She was doing that thing that makes women fearsome: she was trying to make art that mattered. Consider this: maybe a woman\u200a\u2014\u200aor really any person\u200a\u2014\u200awho takes and publishes many pictures of herself is simply ambitious. She wants people to recognize her image-making ability, her aesthetic boldness, her bravery for stepping into the frame and clicking send. When you tell someone that they have sent too many images of themselves into their feeds, when you shame them with cries of narcissism and self-indulgence, when you tell them that they are taking up too much virtual space (space that is at present, basically limitless, save for the invented boundaries of taste): you need to question your motives. Are you afraid of a person\u2019s ambition to be seen? Where does that come from? If you take nothing else away from this historical detour, remember this: These women didn\u2019t have the ability to take and post their own images to thousands of people at once. And they were still the lucky ones, the ones with cameras. So many women\u2019s stories were erased (and will never be recovered) because they didn\u2019t have access to private image-making. Virginia Woolf knew this: \u201c[The history of most women is] hidden either by silence, or by flourishes and ornaments that amount to silence.\u201d The same could be said for not just women but anyone living on the margins of race, gender, or class. The human longing to be seen and appraised has existed for centuries, but only a few had the technological power (and the distribution channels) to control it. Selfies are just one way of making up lost time, all of that yearning and desire that we never got to see because the powerless didn\u2019t have their own cameras and printing presses. Types of people who never got to be looked at before are getting looked at, and are creating entire communities surrounding that looking, and these communities are getting stronger and stronger every day. noun (informal) Let me back up for a moment. This should be said: We are living in times of peak-selfie, and therefore, peak selfie-hatred. When a phenomenon leaks so completely and quickly into the cultural water supply, people are bound to get freaked out. Sure, men and women have been taking pictures of themselves for years, and they were painting themselves before that, and they were carving their faces onto rocks before that. But the selfie, a photograph of oneself with an immediate and distinct social component built into the process, that is something very new. Selfies must be shared\u200a\u2014\u200aor at least be taken as part of a series with the intention to share at least one\u200a\u2014\u200ato be considered selfies. This is my working definition (and for purists, also the one listed in the Oxford Dictionaries) and there are no exceptions. If you take a picture of yourself never intending to post it or send it out, that is not a selfie. If you allow someone else to take your picture, and then put it on Instagram, that\u2019s not a selfie (it is still valuable mythmaking-via-imagery, but with the disqualifying intervention of an outsider). If you take a picture with yourself and someone else and share it, that is called an \u201cussie,\u201d and it technically counts, but is usually met with less disdain than a solo effort. I am interested in the selfie that is entirely autonomous, the type where a single person is the subject, the photographer, the editor, and the publisher. Participating in selfie dialogue is a two-part process: the private and then the public, the conception and then the release, and they work in a kind of electric tandem. The hatred that goes along with selfie-taking might be traced back to the Oxford American dictionary itself, when it tried to grasp for relevance with that old reliable act of web trolling that is its \u201cWord of the Year\u201d selection. In 2013, Oxford picked \u201cselfie,\u201d a decision the organization described in a press release as unanimous, \u201cwith little if any argument,\u201d a \u201crunaway winner.\u201d Whoever wrote the release exhibited elegant restraint: they tracked the origin of the word (legend dates it back to an Australian web forum in 2003), the rapid rise in usage in mainstream media (17,000 percent increase in a single year), and the potential explanation for the suffix (\u201cIt could be argued that the use of the -ie suffix helps to turn an essentially narcissistic enterprise into something rather more endearing\u201d). There are slight jabs at narcissism and herd mentality in the entry, but it is mostly concerned with etymology. Dictionaries are never pure resources: what belongs and what doesn\u2019t is reflective of a very specific ideology. But in this case, Oxford tried to explain its decision as merely reflective of an undeniable cultural force. Other outlets were not so generous in their response to Oxford\u2019s choice. Observe CNN: This tiny blurb set the mold for nearly all of the shame-laden language hurtled at selfie culture, for thousands of other op-eds, Facebook comments, hot takes, malicious RTs, so let\u2019s unpack it: Selfie politics are attention politics: it is all about who gets to be seen, who gets to occupy the visual field. Critics always talk about Kim and her family as taking up too much space, as clogging our DVRs, our Twitter feeds, our newsstands. At a micro-level, the ire leveled at Kim is aimed at everyone who takes selfies: who do you think you are and why should I have to keep up with you? They don\u2019t realize that in posing this question they are proving their own ignorance. One should never have to ask anyone else why they are worthy of being seen. Every human is given a body and a face and then spends the rest of his or her life trying to feel at home there. Worthiness is part of the basic package. No one posts a picture to social media without anticipating the mockery it will receive, either in the form of direct comments or indirect hatred from the wider media. And yet selfies continue to explode in number, reproducing exponentially, filling up server farms and data plans and camera rolls. It\u2019s not just that a cultural faucet, once turned on, can never be turned off. It\u2019s that everyone who posts a selfie must be getting something out of it, something so life-affirming that it makes the harshness endurable. Consider a recent viral news story, a seminal cultural text of selfie shame. During a Colorado Rockies game in September, a pair of male announcers fixated on a group of twenty-something gal pals sitting in the stands, a posse of Alpha Chi Omegas from Arizona State. The commentators had just asked the crowd to send in fan photos for a contest, but immediately began to dig into the women for taking part in the request. The cameras hovered on the women for at least a minute, and it felt like a long, predatory minute. The announcers mocked the women with dad jokes: \u201cEvery single woman in the picture is locked into her phone,\u201d \u201cThese are the best 300 pictures I\u2019ve taken of myself today!\u201d \u201cWelcome to parenting in 2015!\u201d \u201cHold on, gotta take a selfie with a hot dog, with a churro, with a selfie of a selfie.\u201d These jabs felt a thousand years old. The announcers\u2019 rant became a lightning rod for people on either side of the selfie debate. Haters trotted out the classic anti-selfie insults: Millennials are narcissists (no matter how old you are when you take a selfie, by the way, you are always, always a millennial), they don\u2019t care about anything but themselves, they are ruining good old-fashioned American pastimes with their smartphones and their insatiable thirst for likes. But those on the other side of the debate saw something much more toxic buried in the selfie-loathing, something gendered and ugly and terrified. The baseball incident proved, publicly, that selfies aren\u2019t just irritating to people in positions of power, but downright dangerous. Look at it this way: the men in power at the game, the ones sitting in the glass box above the stadium, they have access to a camera in the sky. It is able to focus on whoever it wants, to linger for as long as it wants. The jumbotron rubbernecks lasciviously, a phallic all-seeing eye that ignores women entirely until it chooses to ogle them. When these women decided to make their own fun, to bond and laugh with their friends instead of paying attention to the sports in front of them\u200a\u2014\u200aa sport which, by the way, excludes women from the field and so will never feel all that inclusive to begin with\u200a\u2014\u200athey were seen as committing a transgressive act. They are encouraged to watch men hit a ball with sticks for as many extra innings as it takes, but add a selfie stick into the mix, and minds explode. The announcers\u2019 disgust for that simple act, for a group of women looking at themselves instead of at the men on the field, continued the bait-and-switch that men have been pulling on women for eons: pretending they are madonnas until the moment it is convenient to call them whores. These young women were worth looking at when it suited the men in charge, but as it became clear that their love for each other trumped the love of the game, the men with microphones started to crumble. They did what any player does when their team is losing: they shook their fists and raged. And this rage sounded a bit like a death rattle. The way these men mocked selfies settles them on the wrong side of history. Because they don\u2019t recognize that an equally important game is currently being played out, this very minute, on the web. Selfies are becoming a sport. Instagram is a place where people can turn themselves into trading cards where they can win and become a hero. With every selfie, you can build your fan base, gain stats, pose for your own Wheaties box, and experience the thrill of a cheerleading squad. The reason Kim Kardashian gives for taking her butt selfies? \u201cIt\u2019s fun!\u201d The selfie game\u200a\u2014\u200aposing, posting, interacting\u200a\u2014\u200ais meant to be fun. But it is driving those who don\u2019t know how to play to utter madness. Of course, the enemies of the selfie game aren\u2019t always male; women can shame the selfies of other women with such mean-girl vitriol that they make the announcers\u2019 jabs feel minor league. I sometimes click back to article that Vogue published earlier this year about the evils of selfie-taking, and it makes me laugh. The writer called selfie sticks \u201cthe single most embarrassing invention of our generation\u201d and had plenty of rules to offer: This passage, which reads like a fascist Emily Post, comes from Vogue, that bastion of \u201ctaste\u201d primarily staffed by slender, wealthy women who have more than a small stake in ensuring that capitalism perpetuates itself. Of course. Of course the glossy women\u2019s media wants women to feel like nitwits, to hate their kissy faces, to feel like they cannot post an image of themselves online unless they \u201cwork in fashion\u201d (or work at places like Vogue, where staffers Instagram themselves from their cubicles all the time). These narrow standards for who can and and cannot post selfies expose the values that currently keep most magazines in business. The land of selfies, where people who fall outside the narrow aesthetic guidelines set by the fashion industry can nonetheless dominate the medium, is terrifying to those who want to set consumer agendas. But that\u2019s why you have to keep going: take your selfies, watch it all burn. In 1973, the British feminist scholar Sheila Rowbotham wrote a dense little tome called Female Consciousness, Man\u2019s World, about the ways societies perpetuate oppression. She was writing about selfies and just didn\u2019t know it yet. One of the ways, she wrote, was by discouraging any forms of self-reproduction by individuals, and ways of seeing that were not regulated by the powers that be. In order to subvert this oppression, the individual needed to learn once again how to reproduce herself: Capitalism, as Rowbotham noted, loves to self-reflect. It needs to perpetuate itself, and one of the ways it does so is via imagery\u200a\u2014\u200ai.e. advertising\u200a\u2014\u200athat keeps people desirous, that makes people feel incomplete without whatever shiny new thing has just hit the market. Those at the top benefit, naturally, from creating these images. It is bad then for the lust-economy to have people reveling in pictures they take themselves; it is very difficult to control consumers who do not need to look at the media to know what to value, what to buy, who to honor and protect. Selfies are not inherently political acts, but these resonant, addictive, unregulated images are another manifestation of this growing distrust of the mainstream and the swelling desire by many individuals to reclaim their own narratives now that they have the virtual microphone. But as selfies are so pervasive (and alluring to look at), the only solution for advertisers is to infiltrate the most popular selfie-takers and buy them off. The gods of capitalism offer teenage social media stars thousands of dollars just to be walking billboards for their goods; they buy their labor and their time and call it empowerment. And for some, it is empowering. The checks cash, and some teenagers\u2019 lives change forever. If you could get the opportunity to travel around the world, get gobs of free stuff, and become an instant idol to millions of strangers with the click of a button, could you, at only 18, possibly say no? In late October of this year, a bit of this darkness came to light in public. An 18-year-old Australian Instagram star named Essena O\u2019Neill woke up one morning to discover both her privilege and exploitation in one heartbreaking wave (the kind of revelation that traditionally comes to most teens during their freshman philosophy seminars). She realized that being paid to model free swag and post perfect bikini shots wasn\u2019t worth the capital gains anymore; she was starving herself, relying on double-taps to validate her self-worth, and crying herself to sleep feeling morally and spiritually bankrupt. So she deleted 2,000 Instagram posts, and on the pictures that remained, added new captions exposing the discrepancies between the fantasy and the real. She noted how much she was paid for each picture, how little she had eaten at the moment the flashbulbs illuminated her skinny abdomen. She launched a new website to encourage young girls to talk about how they really feel rather than mask their emotions with Pinterest-ready photo bait, and the effort went viral. From her bedroom, the Noxema-fresh blonde sparked a global conversation about how every selfie can be a lie disguised as a like. Right away the backlash began (and continued to snowball, as all Internet ire does): Critics called her lament a hoax, argued that she was a hypocrite for using the very social media that made her unhappy to spread her message, that she was continuing to seek attention even as she talked about how the eyeballs of strangers made her so miserable. But what this cynicism around her story lacks is any kind of empathy: Essena is only 18. She is still figuring it all out. And in 2015, teens, at least those who leap into the social media battledome, must figure it all out in public. The criticism about Essena is misplaced because she isn\u2019t the problem; she is a victim of the problem. It is important to recognize this aspect of selfie-taking so that it can be fought against (and I celebrate those like Essena who are taking steps to do this, no matter how stumbling and callow her protest may be), but it is also important not to let this one test case stand for the whole. Yes, there are those who would want to exploit your selfie and use it for their own gain. There are bullies and harassers who make the lives of some women (and men) who take selfies unbearable. There are those who allow themselves to get caught up in the vortex of fame and money, who sell the rights to their faces and then feel deeply alienated from their own smiles. There are those who manipulate the selfies of innocent people for cruel media pranks\u200a\u2014\u200ajust last week, a Sikh man in Canada had to defend himself from viral hatred after someone doctored his selfie, adding a suicide vest and a Koran to suggest that he was involved in the Paris attacks. There are those who would screengrab sumptuous nudes and butt selfies and then use them to try to humiliate or shame women for celebrating the pleasures of the flesh. These are all real threats, real dangers. But it is overblowing these fears\u200a\u2014\u200athe endless concern trolling, the wondering what has become of our teen girls, the fretting that we are all feeding too many nudes into a ravenous maw\u200a\u2014\u200athat obliterates the more revolutionary conversation about selfie culture, about what it can do for us. Selfie-taking is often described by its detractors in terms of vulgarity: too much, too often, too desirous, too sensual, too much lip, too much body. Those who are deeply in touch with their body always get labeled obscene. Like most insults, these barbs rise from a place of insecurity: so many people are so afraid of themselves! Of their flesh, of their nooks and crannies, of how they might be found wanting. And the people who are most afraid of being scrutinized are those in control, who have held onto their positions thanks to hierarchical social structures that weren\u2019t really questioned until recently (those that elevate white males over others, say). These powerful men and women are so scared that if anyone looked at them closely and dissected why they are in control that they might turn to dust. So they discourage anyone from looking at anyone else\u200a\u2014\u200aeven themselves\u200a\u2014\u200awith intensity or tenderness. This is why the crusaders talk about selfie sticks as if they were solipsism weaponized and use the word \u201cnarcissism,\u201d which they hope conjures up strong enough revulsion to crush the army of selfies popping up like whack-a-moles. Surely, no one wants to be a narcissist, they say, no one wants to fall into their own reflection and drown. But narcissism is a flimsy charge. It doesn\u2019t hold up in selfie court. Narcissus, Ovid wrote in verse, became enchanted by his own reflection, forming a closed feedback loop with himself. He loved only himself, desired only himself. At no point did Narcissus ever try to share this love with anyone else, to chat up any nymphs about it, to see which of the muses might also delight in his cherub cheeks. Instead, he dove deeper and deeper into his egoistic stupor, and choked to death because he couldn\u2019t look away. Selfies, though, are all about looking away. They are not a closed loop\u200b. T\u200bhey are a new and vibrant language. Selfies never exist in a vacuum. Once they go live, they have adventures, they go out and \u200bmake friends. They are born by waves, digital driftwood: millions of faces washing up on various shores, launching various ships. They \u200bvoyage ahead \u200band probe new communities, and sometimes they bring back stories. Our selfies are weightless versions of ourselves, with wings. The men and women who are create these streams and streams of their own images do so to confirm their own bodies in space, and then to give th\u200bose bodies flight\u200a\u2014\u200ajourneys into the cloud, a kind of stretching back towards a oneness with everything. This may be the most generous way to say that it can be a selfless\u200a\u2014\u200aand defiantly not narcissistic\u200a\u2014\u200aact to put your own dumb face all over the Internet. \u200bThose who see selfies as signs of the end times are focusing on the outliers; the bad actors. The people who accidentally fall into a waterfall and die in the pursuit of the perfect shot. The kids who get addicted to the digital feedback loop and start relying on hearts to get up in the morning. The moms and dads who take selfies when they should be watching their babies; the seething loners who use their selfies as a way to spread hate (if this hate spills over into violence, then selfies will surely get the blame). But these types of delinquents have always existed: the teenagers who don\u2019t pay attention in class, \u200bthe bros \u200bwho snooze through cultural events,\u200b the trolls who care about snark over compassion. \u200bThere are always going to be tourists who shove themselves obnoxiously to the front of the line, people who put their needs over the needs of others, people who gawk at fires and funerals: these are not unique social problems created by the selfie or its accoutrement. \u200bWhat the critics don\u2019t focus on is how to decode the language of selfies when they are being used correctly: what the people in them are trying to do with their portraiture, what big message each individual\u2019s self-representational practice all adds up to in the end. When a \u200byoung \u200bwoman takes a picture alone, in a museum, those who don\u2019t take selfies will scowl, thinking that she is ignoring the art that surrounds her. They will wonder why she cannot stop and breathe in the high culture without the safety blanket of her phone. \u200bBut maybe, just maybe, this \u200byouth is someone who feels less than welcome in this museum, finding it an institution that is cold and sterile and enforcing of a visual language that doesn\u2019t always include faces that look like hers\u200b. Maybe it is a big deal to finally see\u200b herself there\u200b, standing in the same frame as the grand artistic canon\u200b. Maybe she is willfully \u200bputting herself in the context of the art, and then putting the other people who follow her feed in the context of the art\u200b. Maybe she is adding layers of context to the world, not flattening her own experience. Those who cannot see this, who refuse to see this,\u200b are just not yet fluent in her visual \u200blanguage. If they want to reach her, and others like her, they will have to learn. Here\u2019s the secret: Nothing destabilizes power more than an individual that knows his or her own worth, and the campaign against selfies is ultimately a crusade against widespread self-esteem. What selfie-haters fear, deep down, is a growing army of faces they cannot monitor, an army who does not need their approval to march ahead. They fear the young, the technologically savvy, the connected. They fear a community they feel excludes them. The way that Henry wanted to silence and erase Clover, so these selfie-haters want to silence and erase the faces they don\u2019t understand. It is that simple. Anyone who hates selfies outright is likely in the position of privilege to never have felt invisible. They fail to perceive the value that a new way of seeing can bring to so many lives. It is not even necessary to decide \u200bwhether or not selfies are ultimately good or bad for humanity\u200b; we can\u2019t know that for decades or centuries (or maybe never; maybe good and bad are not words that will exist in future generations to describe personal aesthetic choices). They are an active conversation, one that millions of people are engaging with, taking on, wrestling with, falling for, and giving everything to, every minute of every day\u200b. \u200bHop into the feed or fall behind. For the past six months, I have been asking people to send me their faces. Every time I open my email, I have new selfies to look at, with new stories behind why they exist, what the impulse was when someone decided to join forces with their phone. These stories have kept me going, they have been my batteries. \u201cThis was from when I first got my braids. I took this right after I woke up. I take selfies when I don\u2019t want to get out of bed yet. When I took this, I remember thinking, damn, I look so pretty. I hadn\u2019t had long hair since I was 16, and I was super excited about it. I came out when I was 20 as trans, and my hair was super short; then I was living as a man for two years, and my hair was super short. Then I went off testosterone almost two years ago and started growing my hair out. I was super excited to get my braids. It was very gender-affirming for me, and I couldn\u2019t really stop staring at myself and playing with it. I took this selfie and I was like, this is everything. I am killing it right now. \u201cI definitely take selfies for myself, but a big reason why I post them is that I want to be a visible agender person of color, and I want other young trans people to have someone to look at and see themselves reflected. I never had that growing up, and that is super important to me. I feel like my life would be very different if I had known anyone who was non-binary, or if I had known there were other genders than male and female. So my purpose with selfies is 1) I look cute as hell and 2) I want to be very out and accessible.\u201d \u201cI took this on the day I was told that I would die if I removed the tube in my nose. I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes open and forming the smile was the hardest thing I could do\u2026 I took the picture because I was determined to have a \u2018before\u2019 shot because I was adamant that that day was the beginning of my recovery \u2018after.\u2019\u201d \u201cI took the first one in the bathroom of a fancy gala where I felt very out of place. In the other, I had bought this bikini online and when I put it on at home, I remember thinking: \u201cHow could I have ever hated all this?\u201d and almost cried. For years, I thought that the size of my body and the fact that I am queer meant that any sort of femininity wasn\u2019t available to me. Luckily I\u2019ve since realized that femininity is a choose-your-own-adventure, and taking selfies like this remind me that I\u2019m statuesque and gorgeous as hell.\u201d \u201cLast year, a month after my mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s, I spent all of October in Los Angeles. My mom was really nervous about me going because she rightfully thought I\u2019d fall in love with it and not want to come back to the East Coast. To ease the fear and tension around it, I would send her selfies to help erase the miles and show that I was happy and hadn\u2019t like, done anything to my look that she\u2019d missed. So I took this one in the bathroom of my office there and sent it with the text \u2018getting that Cali glow but miss you lots\u2019 then I tossed it through a filter and put it up on Instagram as my first selfie.\u201d \u201cThis selfie is one of my top 10 because I\u2019m happy, the lighting is perfect, I\u2019m radiant, and it\u2019s also the first day of the pumpkin spice latte comeback this season. I don\u2019t know if this sounds vain, but I love selfies. I love taking them and I love being a part of others. In a culture so centered around the reachability of technology and specifically our phones, it\u2019s an exhilarating feeling seeing so many beautiful people embrace this, which is why I love retweeting these beautiful people. I\u2019m enamored by all the women I encounter online and I love to uplift them. I\u2019ll never understand people who aren\u2019t for selfies. Then again, it takes a lot of courage, time, good lighting, energy, and a strong arm to get the right picture and to know your angles, which could be intimidating for these same people.\u201d \u201cIn late 2010, two years after I\u2019d uprooted my life and moved from suburban Indianapolis to Memphis, Tennessee, to live with and then marry the girl from that long-distance thing, I experienced a severe depressive breakdown. I couldn\u2019t seem to accomplish anything, no matter how I tried. Up to that point, I had thrived on the energy that writing and music gave me, but I just couldn\u2019t do it any more. \u201cBut\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe by instinct, maybe by desperation\u200a\u2014\u200aI kept taking selfies on my iPhone. Depression selfies definitely weren\u2019t a thing then, but that seems to be what I was doing\u200a\u2014\u200adocumenting myself to remind myself that I was still there. One day, in late 2010, I stepped into the bathroom, looked in the mirror, decided I looked great, smiled as big as I could, and snapped a picture. The above was the result. I don\u2019t know why I thought that was a smile, why I thought that a sweat-stained plain white tee was a great look, why I didn\u2019t notice that my eyes were swollen from constant almost-crying, or that my eyes were almost completely vacant. Also my haircut was stupid, but my haircuts were always stupid until pretty recently. I do know why I thought I looked great, though: I wasn\u2019t asleep or doubled over in the shower trying to convince myself to stop wanting to die. That ugly selfie was both a declaration of victory in that day\u2019s battle and a rallying cry for the months to come. I could at least stand up. When my brain was screaming for me to kill myself, I could choose to do nothing. \u201cI lost a job to that depression. My marriage spoiled into an abusive dynamic. (Which is a total chicken/egg discussion. I don\u2019t remember which came first. I suspect depression did, largely because I was in such a vulnerable position for manipulation\u200a\u2014\u200aI wanted to die every second I was awake; why would I not also believe that I was unloveable, unworthy of eating, deserving of being hit?) \u201cNew Year\u2019s Eve, 2011, my wife insisted that she bring a friend over and didn\u2019t allow me to invite anyone. It was the guy whose house she had been spending several nights a week at. By midnight, she had fallen asleep on his shoulder, after putting a pillow between us. I don\u2019t know how I worked up the nerve to document that with a selfie: \u201cOn showing that picture to my therapist, he rightly insisted I move out. Which I did, but not until she told me to. About a week later. \u201cIt was weirdly magic. The difference happened almost immediately. This is from May 2012: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a sudden, complete change, but very rapidly (and really, I\u2019ve only noticed while collecting these selfies), the light came back to my eyes, I re-learned how to smile (if only slightly).\u201d \u201c#SELFIEARMY is about radical self-love. I truly believe that for a woman, loving yourself is an act of social disobedience. We\u2019re taught to critique ourselves constantly, ingrained to hate ourselves. We\u2019re taught that anything less than perfection is not good enough, and we\u2019re reminded damn well that we will never be perfect. We could always be thinner, prettier, have bigger boobs, a nicer ass, have clearer skin\u200a\u2014\u200aand due to the Photoshopping epidemic we find ourselves in today, when we see women in the media, we compare ourselves to literally (literally) unattainable standards. Above all, we aren\u2019t taught to define ourselves, but to instead see ourselves only through the eyes of the men around us. If we receive a compliment, we may say \u201cthank you,\u201d but we are never to compliment ourselves first. More than a virtue, modesty was invented to silence women. Historically, men have been the artist and women have been the muse. Taking a selfie is about reclaiming our right to be both\u200a\u2014\u200aYes, I agree that I am a beautiful, magnificent, one of a kind work of art, I just don\u2019t understand why you think you deserve any credit for that. The selfie: a love story: I AM ART AND I AM AN ARTIST. YOU\u2019VE held MY body for ransom for centuries and I am returning it to its rightful owner.\u201d \u201cI think of selfies like a timeline-diary, a way to document my adventures. I get an overwhelming desire to make an image sometimes. Like my circumstances will be really curious or beautiful and it\u2019ll be like an itch I have to scratch. I have to put the moment down. I was a very early proponent of the selfie, growing up with a camera and being on livejournal and MySpace as a teen. Making pictures of myself has always been a part of my regular art practice. \u201cAfter the worst breakup of my life, I took a picture of myself every day for SO LONG just to remind myself I was real. I have an old broken laptop with probably 1,000 photos of myself at age 23\u201324. In a weird way, I cherish the selfie practice I\u2019ve adopted because now, being in a band, I have my picture taken all the time and I know my angles. When it comes time for me to be on camera, I don\u2019t panic. I\u2019ve gained a lot of weight in the last year and I\u2019m getting older\u2026 but this is my face, and it\u2019s the only one I\u2019ve got. Ergo: selfies. This is me, regardless of how I or you feel about it. I exist. \u201cI have had such huge life changes between November 2013, when my band first started touring, and now, and I look back at my Instagram and I\u2019m just shocked. My life has done three or four 180s, and there I am, surviving all of it, still getting on stage and smiling. Like whoa, little dude, there you are. Being as open as I have about my history with mental illness, maybe seeing a photo of my not only living but thriving might be important for someone. \u201cSelfies are giving me agency to show people there\u2019s more to me than the incendiary parts focused on by the media. People definitely want me to be this violent angry person all the time. All screaming pictures. So like, me feeding boys donuts or holding a bunch of flowers or working on one of my cakes is important. I\u2019m a very nice, mild mannered person. I don\u2019t want people to be afraid of me. I\u2019m a boring old lady!\u201d \u201cI took this because I wanted to capture a time shortly after beginning a new treatment protocol for late-stage Lyme disease. I was feeling better than I had in years, and it seemed like being able to freeze that experience of hope could magically prolong it, or at least commemorate it.\u201d \u201cI take selfies because I hated my appearance for so long that I avoided photos altogether for several years in early adulthood. I\u2019m sad that there is no evidence of me during that time and so maybe I\u2019m overcompensating now by taking selfies as often as I do. Most of the selfies I take include either my cat or my ass, though never at the same time. In the case of this selfie, I like that my semi-nakedness seems inconsequential to me. The electric blue is a nice touch but I think this would be a sexy photo even if I was clothed because my expression is so quintessentially me.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have a ton of selfies my phone because I take waaayyyyy too long setting them up, usually long enough to go \u201cwhat\u2019s the point\u201d and not bother. I care just a little too much about the mise en scene, my office is kinda boring, and I\u2019m self-conscious about taking pictures in public. I think selfies are awesome and I always want to see my friends\u2019 beautiful faces but I draw the line when it comes to myself. \u201cLike, even writing this. Whenever people post stuff like \u2018I want to hear from you, and yes I mean you\u2019 I always think \u2018Yeah but not. Like, ME though.\u2019 All that empowering stuff on Twitter and Tumblr like \u2018You look cute today\u2019 or \u2018Send me your address so I can send Christmas cards.\u2019 I always think oh, that\u2019s sweet but they don\u2019t mean me. So that\u2019s something I\u2019m working on. \u201cAlso getting acquainted with my own face. Like, I honestly have no idea what I look like. The picture I took is pretty close to what I see in the mirror but there are photos of me from a party this weekend and they made me want to stay inside with a blanket over my head. Have I been walking around that ugly all the time? (Really opening up the floodgates here.) So part of why I like the few selfies I take is I get to control the narrative.\u201d \u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s hard to focus on crying and holding a phone at the same time, so there is a degree of skill on display here. \u201cI took that picture right after a friendship-ending fight over my transition. Someone I really trusted turned their back on me. You can see it in my face that it\u2019s not mere sadness\u200a\u2014\u200athere\u2019s some real fucking indignation there. How could someone do this to me? \u201cThere are so many pictures out there, somewhere, of me and this person as childhood friends. This selfie was like the end of all that, like the final frame of one of those terrible coming-of-age movies. Except with an even suckier ending. \u201cYou need to document yourself at your most vulnerable, because just having that memory isn\u2019t enough anymore. Without the picture, you don\u2019t really remember how your lips stung when you made that face or the shape of the lines on your face that your tears left. All you remember is that you were sad, and that\u2019s not enough for me.\u201d \u201cAbout two weeks before I took this photo, I was lying in bed naked and said to myself, \u201cI\u2019m tired of thinking of my body as a problem.\u201d Every time I looked in the mirror, I had something awful to say (or think) about my body, and quite suddenly, the thought of going through that old emotional routine felt distinctly and profoundly boring. A week later I found this crop top on sale, and wore it proudly into a conversation with a group of thin white women who worked in fashion writing. On my way out of the meeting, I stopped in front of this mirror next to the elevator, and I posed like I was as fabulous and non-boring as I felt.\u201d \u201cUsually, people take selfies of their most attractive/confident selves, but I am oddly only ever motivated to take selfies after something particularly awkward or memorable has happened (and this doesn\u2019t seem to overlap with my feeling cute, unfortunately). \u201cThis was taken at JFK, right after TSA officers publicly patted down my hair and boobs because my \u2018ethnic\u2019 hair (a term used by the TSA officers) set off the airport body scanner for the 9th time in four weeks. Apparently, thick hair blocks the scanner from working and conceals any area that the hair rests on. If you put your hair up in a bun, they\u2019ll pat the bun and sometimes undo it, just in case you may be concealing a knife or tiny antique pistol within your locks.\u201d \u201cI took 25 pictures of myself laying in different positions across my bed. Some funny, some blurry, and two or three I like. Taking all those pictures made me put my guard down. To do that I imagined my phone to be the face of a friend I admire. \u201cI feel strange sometimes, because selfies are about people declaring agency over how they are seen. Frankly, men who look like me are seen pretty positively by society. When women, trans, non-binary, and people of color post them it is a celebration and political statement: them taking control of their bodies and presentation is a radical move because it rewrites the narrative around their lives one snapshot at a time. I like selfies because they offer me control over my body.\u201d \u201cTaking a selfie is the act of reflecting light I\u2019ve already felt back to myself again and again. It\u2019s an active attempt to remind myself I exist. I guess anytime I\u2019m looking into a camera I\u2019m facing my own mortality, then demanding there be a chance to last forever\u2212but, with a selfie, it\u2019s only in the way I want to be remembered. Like writing my name on some wall as a kid: I WAS HERE. That\u2019s the thing, it\u2019s this intimate promise to myself: I don\u2019t have to be forgotten. There will always be this.\u201d Now let me take a selfie. Here is a short story about one of my own pictures, about what compels me to take them, about why I do this. My way of taking selfies may not be yours; this is not prescriptive. It is just a snapshot, one of many. This particular selfie takes place somewhere in the hours between night and morning. I am up too late again, reading about Frida Kahlo, reading from her diary. There is this line in it that I keep returning to and mouthing silently as I chew off my cuticles. It is only half a sentence, a scribble out of context: I flip the pages and try to distract my hands, but they keep crawling over to my phone, where they always want to go. My hands and my phone are in love. They finish each other\u2019s 140-character sentences. Hello, old friend. Instinct kicks in: I click on the camera and stare into it. My late night face: waxy, bloated, a bit sunken in. But still, there\u2019s something about the lamp light. I look wise in it. I look like someone who has stayed up late reading. I feel compelled to capture this someone, for others to know her, to remember her myself in the morning. I think those words again as I try out different angles. Neck up, neck down, eyes open, eyes closed. The one who gives birth to herself. Along with Julia, Clover, and Francesca, Frida is someone I am always thinking about. Scholars like to link this journal fragment to Kahlo\u2019s love of the great myths, to her affinity for epic stories carved into stones. Kahlo studied ancient Egypt inside her blue house in Coyoacan, and there she must have encountered Nu, the primordial, gender-neutral watery chasm at the beginning of all things, and Atum, the first god, who created himself by rising out of it. Atum was known as the start of the world and also the logical end of it; his name roughly translates to completion, a perfect cycle. He bore himself, and then out of lonesomeness, sneezed out two children (some versions depict this productive sneeze as ejaculate; hieroglyphic porn turns out to be pretty vague); eventually his tears created man. Atum willed himself out of the darkness and then returned to it once his work was done, in his body he contained all pre-existence and post-existence, all the energy and matter in the universe. Kahlo was an artist with a broken body after a horrific trolley accident, a woman who was often confined to her bed and who could not bear children. I can imagine that the story of Atum\u2019s full generative powers was both soothing and painful to her. She could not give birth to any life, much less the world, but she could at least rise out of the mist by herself, flinging her image over and over and over out of the abyss before she returned to it. I see her self-portraits as ecstatic nativities: fertile, bloody, dangerous. I am overwhelmed by them. I close the book and turn to fine-tuning my own face. It needs more saturation and bit of blurring around my smile lines. I scroll through filter after filter until one just feels right, the closest I will get to having aesthetic instinct at 3 a.m. And then, it\u2019s gone. Off to Instagram, off to earn its first gold star. I have sliced off a little piece of myself that is also a piece of not myself, and the image no longer belongs to me. There is loss in this moment of separation: you wish your pic well, you hope it grows up to be a winner. You have hopes and expectations for what it will do long after you have returned to Nu\u2019s primordial lake, the song of you it might sing. Goodbye, little nighttime selfie. I hope you outlive me, I hope you are a reminder that I once was a person who lived. People have asked if I ever feel guilty about using tints or hazing out my imperfections, if I feel that I am somehow betraying truth by tossing an airbrushed idea of myself into the future. This is one of the major critiques leveled against selfies: that they deceive. That we can never really see ourselves clearly. But all self-construction is narrative, it\u2019s all improvisation. Filters don\u2019t always blur out the facts; they can work as storytellers, dramatic lighting for personal theater. Look at me crying in hypercolor washed over with a blue glaze; forcing you to hear my #feelings soliloquy. Look at me smiling softly alone in my room, bathed in light, pale as vapor, beatific as the piet\u00e1; bear witness to this joy, this stillness, this dreamy intermission between moments of anxiety. I am the director of this feed; and I am going to act like I am Orson Fucking Welles. Right now, there are over 15 apps on the market devoted primarily to the act of taking selfies. There\u2019s FaceTune, Bestie, Perfect 365, CamMe, YouCam, Selfie Studio, CreamCam, Candy Camera, Cymera, Selfie Booth, Selfius, Frontback, Dayfie, Everyday. In March 2014, the Apple store added a dedicated \u201cSelfie\u201d section (much to tech bloggers chagrin; Engadget mocked the virtual storefront as \u201cnot the app store section we needed, but the app store section we deserved.\u201d). The apps all function in slightly different ways, but they all optimize both the process of taking a selfie and the post-production tinkering that happens before pressing send. CamMe is made to enhance the initial photo-capture; it allows the person holding the smartphone to click the shutter with a hand gesture (a closing of the fist). This freedom from hardware means that a selfie-taker can stretch out, walk away, pose in full body, moon from behind. It liberates the hands, and in doing so, lets you twist around like a figure drawing model, lets you mimic and dialogue with the iconic self portraits of art history (NB: I refuse to wade into the perennial art critic debate about whether Rembrandt would be rolling in his grave over all this). Editing apps like FaceTune exist to streamline everything that comes after the snap; the serious work of preparing an image for gallery viewing. FaceTune features a powerful arsenal of editing tools: you can fuzz out blemishes, whiten teeth, add a dewy soft-focus like a smear of Vaseline on the lens, brighten your eyes, hollow your jowls. This is where selfies start to get more controversial: if, in 2015, we agree that it is blurry feminism (at best) to Photoshop celebrities beyond recognition on magazine covers, then why are we comfortable erasing our own perceived imperfections? If selfies are about warts-and-all self-acceptance, what message does it send when we don\u2019t show the warts? I understand these fears, but also would argue that using a personal Photoshop machine doesn\u2019t necessarily present the same grand-scale self-esteem attack that glossy magazine covers do. Celebrities and models never have final approval on their covers; but selfie-takers own the entire publicity machine: you take the shot, you edit the shot, you publish the shot. All the artifice is in your hands, and that can feel like power. FaceTune, and other apps like it, are a way of playing, of gaming your face. They let you you tweak and shade, paint and polish. They let you pick out your favorite features and highlight them. They let you art direct your own portrait, sending viewers\u2019 eyeballs to precise locations on your face. Some people see editing apps as a way to hide behind magic wands, but I see them as very public declarations of a common human hunger: to be seen in the light you want to be seen in. It\u2019s your selfie party; cry in sepia tone if you want to. The app I use is called Bestie, and it combines the two types of apps into a one-stop experience. It opens onto a front-facing lens, and then immediately applies a smooth veneer, airbrushing in real-time. Under-eye circles magically disappear, the complexion goes luminous. After I downloaded Bestie, I realized there is a world in which I never again need to keep an unedited version of my own image on my camera roll; there could be no faulty negatives to protect from the cloud, nothing to leak, nothing to wince at later. And I know instinctually that I don\u2019t want that. Sometimes when I feel like I look my worst, I take selfies outside of the app. This act makes some strange sense to me; on certain moody days, it can also feel like high-risk behavior. I put up these few raw images a year to remind myself (and my followers) that even with the wrinkles and stray eyebrow hairs and visible pores, I am a person who should be seen and appraised, and even found acceptable despite these flaws. But I still love the apps; I believe in them. It took Cindy Sherman hundreds of different costumes to interrogate all the different corners of herself; apps let us try out her lifetime of masquerade with just a few quick clicks. I am not ashamed to use them, nor should anyone be. Apps turn your iPhone into the Queen\u2019s Magic Mirror. Stare into it. Think: I am the fairest of them all, I will eat their hearts. I have a friend who controls her own image online with an iron fist; she hates encountering pictures of herself taken without consent. She often scrolls through Instagram and Facebook untagging every candid image, like a burglar wiping off fingerprints. I used to think this was a bizarre eccentricity, but after living in the world of selfies for a while, I understand it. Photographs that you don\u2019t control may have some journalistic benefit one day, but they can feel exploitative, unwieldy, and strange. Selfies provide a blessed course-correct to this photographic chaos, a chance to refocus the narrative that others might want to tell about you (or not tell\u200a\u2014\u200aselfies also allow you to have pictures available online even if you are the type to rarely show up in party photographs or crowd shots). When I met my partner, he told me that he got to know me through my selfies. This was for the best. Because if you Google me, you will get: an almost feral picture from an old gossip blog article in which I am wearing schlumpy buffalo plaid and look like I have a thyroid condition, a photo of myself at 24 in a backyard garden wearing a horrible pastel scarf and writing in a notebook while everyone around me seems to be talking to each other, and some photos of myself at literary events, surrounded by acquaintances with my hair in a topknot. If you make guesses about me from these photos, some of them will be right: I am a writer in Brooklyn and have worn the lumberjack flannels and scarves to prove it, I have attended parties, I have read in public, at one point I thought it would be a good idea to wear a formal bowtie with a dress. But I don\u2019t recognize myself in any of those photos, and not just because some of them are unflattering. It is because I can only view that person as an other, as someone I might have crossed paths with a few times but who still takes me several blinks to remember. Even as a young girl, I always felt such a discrepancy between the person I saw in the mirror and the person that showed up in photographs. But my selfies tell another story, one where the person I see and the person I feel that I am fuse in the same instant, one that feels closer to who I am, one that always ignites a flash of recognition when I revisit them (and as anyone who takes and posts a lot of selfies will tell you, going back to look at old photos can be as tender and thrilling as finding a diary). Scroll back through my Instagram. There I am in black and white, wearing oversized sunglasses, drinking a Slurpee, looking like a still from a new wave film on a hot summer day. There I am in driving a vintage car in Los Angeles, with my eyes focused on the side mirror (the closest I may ever be cosplaying as Didion with her Stingray). There I am, hair in a static halo around my face, no makeup on, a coffee the size of a small child in my hands, with the caption \u201cI woke up like this.\u201d There I am after a long night of writing, my face drained but at peace with what I\u2019ve made. There I am, red lips and false eyelashes; less myself, more drunk woman in a Weimar cabaret. There I am, sweat-stained and piglet pink after the gym. There I am, tears running down my face, after I capture myself crying (YET AGAIN) after watching the final scene of A River Runs Through It. There I am, stunned with grief after receiving bad news and the only thing I could think to do in the moment was capture it. There I am in an outfit that cinches my waist and shows off all the dimensions of my body, dimensions I used to hate and now find sumptuous and human, dimensions that make me feel stronger, even hulk-like, every time I share them. There I am, a book in my hand, peering over its edges into the frame. There I am, looking serious, or carefree, or intense, or demure, or bold\u200a\u2014\u200aI have looked a thousand different ways. Someone who chooses to encounter me for the first time on my feed, like my partner did, is making a compassionate choice. Because that\u2019s where you can find my prismatic selves, my multitudes. Like everyone else, I own the copyright to my face. I am the one who gives birth to her self(ie). I know the messages I want to convey with each picture that I post, they are all arrows aimed at a big target, the one that could one day convey a larger truth about myself than any one image could. If we tell ourselves stories in order to live, sometimes those stories come in the form of pictures of your own silly miracle of a face, taken from as many angles and expressed in as many colors and shadows as technology will allow. We are writing the story of how we want to be seen. In this way, selfies are teaching tools. When I learned that my mother checked my Instagram, my first reaction was fear, followed by gratitude. I think that selfies (first mine, and now the ones she takes and sends to me via text or Facebook) have helped us get to know each other better, an adult daughter and her adult mother learning how we each view ourselves. Selfies can inform the people who love and know you how to really look at you. I wonder if parents who feel their child takes too many selfies would do better to ask questions about these images instead of trying to shut them off at the source. Hugely instructive conversations can come out of asking a person why they posted a particular selfie on a particular day. Spoiler alert: it often has more to do with \u201cI just thought I looked hot.\u201d Asking someone in your life about how and why they put up their own portrait can be a vital new step in gaining a deeper understanding. Selfies are begging for this question, and every picture posted is an invitation to ask it. Just as any of you is one of a living crowd, I was one of a crowd. I look upon hundreds of faces every day and I feel refreshed. I feel refreshed by watching other people look upon those same faces, and so on. This second-order looking, this swelling communal river, is the aspect of selfies we need to fight to protect by not shaming those who take them. If you are afraid of wading into this river, if you feel there is nothing to see there, then selfies might not be meant for you. And just to put it on the record, to make things clear, here are some of the other people who selfies are not for: But there are millions of people who selfies are for. There are millions who use them, love them, and are loyal to them\u200a\u2014\u200athese are the people talked to, emailed with, gazed at, and become a fan of while scrolling through my feeds, the people I have watched being watched. These are the people who find comfort and life force in their selfies, and who give the most to the community in return. These are the bodies that you tear down when you are afraid of them, these are the lives at stake. This is the radical potential of selfies. This is what I think about most when I take them, when I channel women of the past, when I think about Julia and Clover and Frida and Francesca, when I think about all the people who wanted so badly to be seen but were born too soon to ever have an @ handle of their own. I wish, all the time, my great-grandmothers (women I never knew; a gentle seamstress, a boisterous lawyer\u2019s wife) could have taken a million selfies. I feel like I owe it to them and to those who feel unseen now, to keep posting, to keep sharing, to keep liking, to keep seeking out new faces to like. I feel that I am, that we all are, writing our own history with every selfie. This is the way that selfies become death masks, memorials to the idea that once, we existed. There is joy in confirming that you have a self, that you have a life, that the ultimate gift you didn\u2019t ask for is real, that your body takes up mass. And then there is the sorrow of knowing the gift must be returned, that your ship has holes in it and will one day sink, that no body makes it to the other shore in tact. The ego, then, is about loving oneself enough to temporarily forget that we are all disappearing, loving oneself out of the terror of nothingness, loving oneself out of bed. Seen this way, self-regard is nothing to be ashamed of; it is merely a survival tactic. And selfies are an instrument in this survival, tiny rages against the dying of the light (or the iPhone battery, whichever comes first). They are a chance to create images that will last longer than we will, mediated by ourselves, passed along by ourselves, with targets we might not yet know but who will nonetheless be grateful to discover them. Your selfie is never sick, never has its heart broken, never ages. It doesn\u2019t need sex or food or pharmaceutical assistance. Your selfie is able to travel to places you cannot, and it will outlive you. Remember this: your selfie is an artifact and a gift. People in your own time might not see it that way. They will call you narcissistic for giving birth to hundreds, maybe thousands, of fractured little selves. They will wonder why you need so much confirmation, so much attention, so much visibility. They will experience your face as an assault. Pay them no mind. Your selfie has already ventured off to the future, where all of us are dead. This story was written by Rachel Syme.

In a talk apparently worthy of TED (and summarised here), CEO Mohamad Jebara explains how, through a model inspired by Steven Levitt\u2019s research, parents can recuperate their weekly subscription charge if their children complete weekly maths exercises. Jebara acknowledges the unsettling notion of bribing students to do mathematics. He is a self-professed purist, reaching for the words of one Francis Su: \u201cWe study mathematics for play, for beauty, for truth, for justice and for love.\u201d It does not get purer than that. Jebara also recognises that school maths reflects none of these traits. It is premised on performance rather than play, shuns beauty for ugly representations, and cares little for truth, justice or love. For Jebara, school maths is a means to an end, a pain that students must endure before enjoying the fruits of mathematics. And by paying students to consume the torrid diet of school maths, we can rest assured that our investment will endow them with a love and appreciation of mathematics in the long term. The approach, plucked right out of the rationalist playbook, is intriguing. It falls short, however, in its deference to school maths. Jebara is also an apologist for the ugly, confusing form of mathematics that so many students are repelled by. Rather than attempting to beautify the subject, and to seek out more joyous, illuminating representations of mathematics, Jebara makes the fatalistic assumption that the current form of school maths is the only path to enlightenment. He justifies the obnoxious fixation on mathematical facts and procedures by claiming, \u2018The more you know, the more you want to know\u2026\u2019 The problem with this edict is that the knowledge of school maths is often illusory. What good is it to \u2018know\u2019 procedures that you possess little understanding of? Curiosity is not a natural consequence of mindless consumption. Jebara is also willing to accept that mathematics must be complex. Mathematics should always feel challenging; indeed, students will only experience the glorious state of flow when a problem is pitched beyond outside of their current abilities. But the difficulty of school maths usually results in anxiety and despair rather than flow. At times it is needlessly confusing, owing to weak representations, fixed pacing through the curriculum and the absence of reasoning. Mathematics should be perplexing for the right reasons, few of which are found in the curriculum. Jebara cites evidence that the cash incentives are working: \u201cIt turns out that students on the rewards program are 70% more engaged than those not on the program.\u201d What does engagement mean here? Are its proxies usage and exercise completion metrics? If so, how can we be sure that students\u2019 time on Mathspace is productive, and reflective of their best efforts? Every system is made to be gamed, and cash incentives may induce even the best-intentioned students and parents to treat homework as a box-ticking exercise. The giveaway is the \u201870% increase\u2019 claim\u200a\u2014\u200asuch a statistic can only apply to quantifiable traits. Any attempt to capture engagement so precisely falls short of the deeply innate sense of joy that we want students to experience. I\u2019m not sure Francis Su intended to have his vision for mathematics reduced to blunt measurement. It should not surprise us that cash incentives are an effective way of getting students to do school maths. Drawing on another TED talk, Daniel Pink resolves the puzzle of motivation by illustrating how extrinsic rewards, such as cash incentives, tend to be more motivating when asking humans to work on low-level cognitive tasks (the kind plastered across the maths curriculum). Higher-order cognitive tasks, on the other hand, are motivating in their own right\u200a\u2014\u200athe drive is intrinsic and cash incentives are a deterrent if anything. I would suggest that the purist\u2019s version of mathematics, which is predicated on the innate satisfaction of problem posing and solving, is resistant to the lure of money. That cash is proving to be an incentive for homework only reinforces the superficiality of school maths. Worse, it teaches students that mathematics is necessarily painful and ugly, and that they deserve payment for enduring it. Students who come to associate mathematics with cash rewards may never appreciate the subject in its own right. It is a shame that Jebara\u2019s own product, Mathspace, displays little of the courage or creativity needed to bring a more uplifting version of maths to life. The plaudits belong to the heroes of mathematics education who are aspirational enough to champion new pedagogies, and practical enough to work within the existing realities of the curriculum. Mathspace, meanwhile, looks and feels very much like the standard form of school maths. It copes with a selection of multi-step problems and allows for handwritten inputs. Yet its technological innovation does nothing to shift the pedagogy of mathematics. Left with a digitised projection of school maths, what is one to do but coerce students into engagement? The purist would resist the coercive brand of maths and place their faith in a more uplifting version of mathematics. They would be very sceptical of attempts to pay students for the supposed privilege of engaging with their maths app. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

That output may be a thought (I want curry for dinner); it may be an action (make curry); it may be a change in mood (yay curry!). Whatever the output, that \u201csomething\u201d is a transformation of some form of input (a menu) to output (\u201cchicken dansak, please\u201d). And if we think of a brain as a device that transforms inputs to outputs then, inexorably, the computer becomes our analogy of choice. For some this analogy is merely a useful rhetorical device; for others it is a serious idea. But the brain isn\u2019t a computer. Each neuron is a computer. Your cortex contains 17 billion computers. OK, what? Look at this: This is a picture of a pyramidal cell, the neuron that makes up most of your cortex. The blob in the centre is the neuron\u2019s body; the wires stretching and branching above and below are the dendrites, the twisting cables that gather the inputs from other neurons near and far. Those inputs fall all across the dendrites, some right up close to the body, some far out on the tips. Where they fall matters. But you wouldn\u2019t think it. When talking about how neurons work, we usually end up with the sum-up-inputs-and-spit-out-spike idea. In this idea, the dendrites are just a device to collect inputs. Activating each input alone makes a small change to the neuron\u2019s voltage. Sum up enough of these small changes, from all across the dendrites, and the neuron will spit out a spike from its body, down its axon, to go be an input to other neurons. It\u2019s a handy mental model for thinking about neurons. It forms the basis for all artificial neural networks. It\u2019s wrong. Those dendrites are not just bits of wire: they also have their own apparatus for making spikes. If enough inputs are activated in the same small bit of dendrite then the sum of those simultaneous inputs will be bigger than the sum of each input acting alone: The relationship between the number of active inputs and the size of the response in a little bit of dendrite looks like this: There\u2019s the local spike: the sudden jump from almost no response to a few inputs, to a big response with just one more input. A bit of dendrite is \u201csupralinear\u201d: within a dendrite, 2+2=6. We\u2019ve known about these local spikes in bits of dendrite for many years. We\u2019ve seen these local spikes in neurons within slices of brain. We\u2019ve seen them in the brains of anaesthetised animals having their paws tickled (yes, unconscious brains still feel stuff; they just don\u2019t bother to tell anyone). We\u2019ve very recently seen them in the dendrites of neurons in animals that were moving about (yeah, Moore and friends recorded the activity in something a few micrometres across from the brain of a mouse that was moving about; crazy, huh?). A pyramidal neuron\u2019s dendrites can make \u201cspikes\u201d. So they exist: but why does this local spike change the way we think about the brain as a computer? Because the dendrites of a pyramidal neuron contain many separate branches. And each can sum-up-and-spit-out-a-spike. Which means that each branch of a dendrite acts like a little nonlinear output device, summing up and outputting a local spike if that branch gets enough inputs at roughly the same time: Wait. Wasn\u2019t that our model of a neuron? Yes it was. Now if we replace each little branch of dendrite with one of our little \u201cneuron\u201d devices, then a pyramidal neuron looks something like this: Yes, each pyramidal neuron is a two layer neural network. All by itself. Beautiful work by Poizrai and Mel back in 2003 showed this explicitly. They built a complex computer model of a single neuron, simulating each little bit of dendrite, the local spikes within them, and how they sweep down to the body. They then directly compared the output of the neuron to the output of a two-layer neural network: and they were the same. The extraordinary implication of these local spikes is that each neuron is a computer. By itself the neuron can compute a huge range of so-called nonlinear functions. Functions that a neuron which just sums-up-and-spits-out-a-spike cannot ever compute. For example, with four inputs (Blue, Sea, Yellow, and Sun) and two branches acting as little non-linear devices, we can set up a pyramidal neuron to compute the \u201cfeature-binding\u201d function: we can ask it to respond to Blue and Sea together, or respond to Yellow and Sun together, but not to respond otherwise\u200a\u2014\u200anot even to Blue and Sun together or Yellow and Sea together. Of course, neurons receive many more than four inputs, and have many more than two branches: so the range of logical functions they could compute is astronomical. More recently, Romain Caze and friends (I am one of those friends) have shown that a single neuron can compute an amazing range of functions even if it cannot make a local, dendritic spike. Because dendrites are naturally not linear: in their normal state they actually sum up inputs to total less than the individual values. They are sub-linear. For them 2+2 = 3.5. And having many dendritic branches with sub-linear summation also lets the neuron act as two-layer neural network. A two-layer neural network that can compute a different set of non-linear functions to those computed by neurons with supra-linear dendrites. And pretty much every neuron in the brain has dendrites. So almost all neurons could, in principle, be a two-layer neural network. The other amazing implication of the local spike is that neurons know a hell of a lot more about the world than they tell us\u200a\u2014\u200aor other neurons, for that matter. Not long ago, I asked a simple question: How does the brain compartmentalise information? When we look at the wiring between neurons in the brain, we can trace a path from any neuron to any other. How then does information apparently available in one part of the brain (say, the smell of curry) not appear in all other parts of the brain (like the visual cortex)? There are two opposing answers to that. The first is, in some cases, the brain is not compartmentalised: information does pop up in weird places, like sound in brain regions dealing with place. But the other answer is: the brain is compartmentalised\u200a\u2014\u200aby dendrites. As we just saw, the local spike is a non-linear event: it is bigger than the sum of its inputs. And the neuron\u2019s body basically can\u2019t detect anything that is not a local spike. Which means that it ignores most of its individual inputs: the bit which spits out the spike to the rest of the brain is isolated from much of the information the neuron receives. The neuron only responds when a lot of the inputs are active together in time and in space (on the same bit of dendrite). If this was true, then we should see that dendrites respond to things that the neuron does not respond to. We see exactly this. In visual cortex, we know that many neurons respond only to things in the world moving at a certain angle (like most, but by no means all of us, they have a preferred orientation). Some neurons fire their spikes to things at 60 degrees; some at 90 degrees; some at 120 degrees. But when we record what their dendrites respond to, we see responses to every angle. The dendrites know a hell of a lot more about how objects in the world are arranged than the neuron\u2019s body does. They also look at a hell of a lot more of the world. Neurons in visual cortex only respond to things in a particular position in the world\u200a\u2014\u200aone neuron may respond to things in the top left of your vision; another to things in the bottom right. Very recently Sonia Hofer and her team showed that while the spikes from neurons only happen in response to objects appearing in one particular position, their dendrites respond to many different positions in the world, often far from the neuron\u2019s apparent preferred position. So the neurons respond only to a small fraction of the information they receive, with the rest tucked away in their dendrites. Why does all this matter? It means that each neuron could radically change its function by changes to just a few of its inputs. A few get weaker, and suddenly a whole branch of dendrite goes silent: the neuron that was previously happy to see cats, for that branch liked cats, no longer responds when your cat walks over your bloody keyboard as you are working\u200a\u2014\u200aand you are a much calmer, more together person as a result. A few inputs get stronger, and suddenly a whole branch starts responding: a neuron that previously did not care for the taste of olives now responds joyously to a mouthful of ripe green olive\u200a\u2014\u200ain my experience, this neuron only comes online in your early twenties. If all inputs were summed together, than changing a neuron\u2019s function would mean having the new inputs laboriously fight each and every other input for attention; but have each bit of dendrite act independently, and new computations become a doddle. It means the brain can do many computations beyond treating each neuron as a machine for summing up inputs and spitting out a spike. Yet that\u2019s the basis for all the units that make up an artificial neural network. It suggests that deep learning and its AI brethren have but glimpsed the computational power of an actual brain. Your cortex contains 17 billion neurons. To understand what they do, we often make analogies with computers. Some use these analogies as cornerstones of their arguments. Some consider them to be deeply misguided. Our analogies often look to artificial neural networks: for neural networks compute, and they are made of up neuron-like things; and so, therefore, should brains compute. But if we think the brain is a computer, because it is like a neural network, then now we must admit that individual neurons are computers too. All 17 billion of them in your cortex; perhaps all 86 billion in your brain. And so it means your cortex is not a neural network. Your cortex is a neural network of neural networks.

Today, the news is dominated by Elon Musk running victory laps after the successful launch of the most powerful rocket since the Space Shuttle. The launch\u200a\u2014\u200aan admittedly impressive technical achievement that can be more accurately attributed to years of hard work by engineers and scientists rather than the whims of a rich, bored douchebag\u200a\u2014\u200ahas naturally inspired quite a degree of excitement. Most importantly, this is a prime opportunity for the media hivemind to engage in one of their favorite pastimes: gushing breathlessly about the antics of Elon Musk. Indeed, if you look at the past couple years of coverage of Musk, all the well-researched critical journalism is overshadowed by people tripping over themselves to have the most shared article singing his praises, all while broadly attributing SpaceX\u2019s work to one person: himself. This is ostensibly a piece of hard journalism on the launch by CNBC, but it seems far more interested in Musk than in the actual launch, and regurgitates his grandiose claims about the potential scope of his work without any scientific context or rebuttal: This, to be clear, is not adequate journalism: it is accidental PR, giving Musk a platform for his claims to be presented without scrutiny. It would take comparatively minimal effort to link to public documents that proved or disproved his claim that SpaceX used no public funding, or to note that evidence could not be found to prove the claim either way. The way we smooth over our grossly unequal reality is deeply dehumanizing, down to the fundamental way in which this has been described in the news almost singularly as Musk\u2019s achievement. But it isn\u2019t always such a blatant process\u200a\u2014\u200asometimes, its as simple as Bloomberg\u2019s (via TIME) choice to describe onlookers for a major rocket launch as Musk\u2019s \u201cfans\u201d, rather than people interested in one of the most American of all pastimes: watching a big thing blow up and/or go fast. The phenomenon is far more pronounced once you pass into the realm of opinions writing\u200a\u2014\u200awhich, it should be noted, is often treated in the popular eye with a level of disproportionate authority. One post in particular, \u201cElon Musk Does it Again\u201d from Scientific American, is so effusive in its praise that it recalls shades of the infamous Pitchfork Kid A review: While this may be effectively a blog post, it\u2019s still pretty demoralizing to see this lack of scrutiny in the esteemed Scientific American. The writer is tripping over himself to praise a wealthy man, and it\u2019s hard to take anything else he says seriously as a result. This dynamic has followed Musk everywhere\u200a\u2014\u200ait is difficult to find a similarly wealthy person whose ratio of positive to negative press is as grossly imbalanced as his. If you feel a need to delve further into this phenomenon, the search \u201cElon Musk saves world\u201d comes up with a pretty upsetting number of results. While many of those do indeed apply necessary skepticism to his lofty claims, many of them take it at face value. Unfortunately, there\u2019s a problem with reporting about the rich in such a lighthearted and non-confrontational manner. Musk and his ilk are modern-day robber-barons whose wealth comes at an immense human cost. As such, humanizing them effectively acts as free PR\u200a\u2014\u200aa counter-narrative to the violence of their wealth. This is a fundamental abdication of journalistic duty, one which allows the wealthiest, most powerful people alive to spout their narrative in many cases with limited-to-no pushback. Strangely, Musk is far more broadly popular than most billionaires. It\u2019s understandable to a degree: Musk is the deeply unfunny Reddit nerd we all know and loathe. Musk has a vocal interest in popular items of \u201cnerd culture\u201d\u00a0, makes grandiose-and-baseless statements about a vague desire to elevate the quality of life in the world, and lobs weak jokes on social media with the prowess of a 27 year old who thinks they can Tweet their way out of the seemingly endless banality of their own life. He\u2019s just like us! As a result, media outlets at all levels of renown have reported on tiny details of his personal life, making his interest in Rick and Morty somehow newsworthy. But really, he isn\u2019t, because again: he now has enough money to single-handedly end homelessness in the United States. There\u2019s a lot I can get into here about how Musk is a union-busting, worker-abusing, tax-evading, grossly negligent financier whose pet projects are draining funding and talent for actual infrastructure improvement and scientific development. If you\u2019re writing about Musk or any other billionaire, it is always relevant to note how people have accumulated wealth, and who they have harmed to do so. But even if Musk was, by all accounts, a paragon of a good person who followed the letter of the law, he\u2019d still be scum. Elon Musk is one of the fraction of a percent of people with the material wealth and power to impose near-instant improvement in people\u2019s lives, and chooses to use his astonishing wealth to\u2026 generate more wealth and pursue his pet projects. Moreover, to get to Musk\u2019s level of wealth, a person must do unspeakably evil things. You can\u2019t reach such wealth without actively denying someone else the right to an even minimally decent existence. Whether it\u2019s cutting corners, mistreating workers, bulldozing affordable housing and wildlife, or simply the banal evil of pursuing capital for its own sake, at a certain point you can\u2019t explain it away. Musk\u2019s pursuit of capital has cost people their homes, their jobs, their health, and their lives. He knows this, and he has continued\u200a\u2014\u200aaccelerated, even. It is the same choice every rich person makes. As such, Musk\u2019s fundamental contempt is laid bare: he has the capacity to do good, and actively chooses not to. It is astounding to me that such contempt is not immediately transparent to everyone else\u200a\u2014\u200awhich makes it all the more frustrating that people generally do not write or talk about Musk with such vitriol accordingly. In spite of this, Musk is generally considered to be altruistic in spite of the fact that he doesn\u2019t indulge in the same kind of performative, manipulative philanthropy efforts in the way people like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet have. His appeal comes from his admittedly lofty ambitions to change the world\u200a\u2014\u200ain his image. Elon Musk strives to impose his very narrow view of the future on the world writ large, his story of the future is invariably all about himself and his own ventures. Musk has crafted his rhetoric around SpaceX to paint his company as the only hope for space travel\u200a\u2014\u200aas the company that will take humanity to Mars. Thanks to a combination of the economic downturn and Bush administration cuts to NASA that ended the shuttle program, Musk has strived to paint SpaceX as a de facto private replacement for NASA. Ownership of space is impossible, but Musk aims for the next best thing: control over access and resources. In stoking public excitement, Musk doesn\u2019t aspire to raise humanity\u200a\u2014\u200ahe aspires to attract investors. SpaceX is, as such, effectively a very boring supervillain\u2019s plot. Unfortunately a good deal of people fall for Musk\u2019s egocentric view of progress, and it\u2019s hard to blame people who bite: everyone wants to believe improvement is tangible, easy, and inevitable\u200a\u2014\u200aMusk offers this in the form of a convenient narrative that paints him as an iconoclast pushing for the future, rather than as a petty oligarch cashing in on an untapped market. The weird, perverse phenomenon of admiration this inspires is best seen here, in an infographic slavishly devoted to singing his praises in documenting his life and work. Unintentionally, this infographic ends up being the most damning possible indictment of Musk, as it speculates on the future Musk envisions for himself (and the World, by extension): the peak of imagination for Musk and his acolytes is to see trips to Mars become an attainable luxury, a \u201cmere\u201d $200,000. This, of course, isn\u2019t intended as some unrealistic statement that space travel isn\u2019t costly\u200a\u2014\u200ait is instead a condemnation of priorities. Musk\u2019s end game here is to be the first person to space simply so he can own that market. You can see a similar phenomenon in any supposedly altruistic venture by these oligarchs: the best example, the Gates foundation, has become one of the most powerful non-state actors in the world by wielding so much money as to redefine international aid, and to make it inseparable from themselves and their whims. To bring this back to what this piece is ostensibly about, a CNN opinion piece titled \u201cElon Musk just launched our Breathtaking New Adventure\u201d drives this point home in the vision of the future they paint: This is why the way we gush over the Randian exploits of rich nerds is so dangerous: people actually buy it. In this grandiose prayer of thanks for Musk and the free market, the author notably omits the billions of dollars in federal funding that Musk has received for SpaceX. Not only is this directly taking resources that, yes, come from taxpayers, this is money not going to benefit programs or to scientific efforts aimed at the general good. In short, we are still paying for it, but we\u2019re not even getting anything out of it. Not without a \u201cmodest\u201d $200,000 and a lifetime of waiting, at least. Again: what happened today was an incredible achievement, but it is an achievement that does not belong to Musk, much as he will reap all the credit for it. This was the work of engineers, physicists, programmers, factory workers, janitors, and their neglected families as all of them worked inhumane hours to realize Musk\u2019s childish fantasies and cynical ambitions alike. They should all be incredibly proud of what they accomplished. Musk just made some dumb tweets and stuck a car in it, all while holding their lives hostage with the implicit contract that binds all workers under capital: work for me if you want to eat. When you read about the rich, their description almost always includes a number: their net worth. But this number has a never-mentioned story told through the unspeakable things a rich person had to do to get that wealth. When you omit that story without even an acknowledgement, the implicit statement is that it doesn\u2019t matter\u200a\u2014\u200athat the lives ruined and ended to accumulate this wealth do not matter. But we will keep treating rich tyrants like Musk with kid gloves because it\u2019s profitable. These rich idiots are the ones who cut the checks anyways. And so, for now, the cycle continues: The narrative of human history is one of deluded individuals who see God as a tyrant, and model themselves in his image in their desire to wield power over others. They are propped up in equal measure by sycophants who see a route to comfort, and the dispossessed who have no means to stop them. You do not have to keep worshiping these false gods. And at the very least, you don\u2019t have to write about them so breathlessly. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

The body was the color of an uncooked hot dog. It was also obese, and rubbery, and had what I was slow to recognize as breasts. Caleb explained that he was feeling for a pacemaker. Pacemakers tend to explode at high temperatures, and any damage to one of the crematory\u2019s quarter-million-dollar ovens would be on the Wilde Funeral Home. Even with the ovens set to \u201cslow roast,\u201d as the cremator put it, the buggers could go off. Caleb stopped, massaged, then stopped again, as though he felt something under the skin. \u201cToo big to be a morphine pump,\u201d he said cheerfully. At 32 years old, fresh-faced and boyishly handsome, he looks less like an undertaker than like the member of an a cappella group. He strapped on some gloves and asked the cremator for a scalpel. It\u2019s hard for me to describe what happened next. Do you know the scene in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, when the high priest reaches into the guy\u2019s chest and pulls out his beating heart, all without a drip of blood? Imagine that, if the high priest had had the geniality of a plumber. Caleb slit open the dead woman\u2019s chest and then wriggled his hand inside of it, rooting around for a while before pulling out something that looked like a metal lollipop. There was a blob of human flesh on his glove. The woman\u2019s chest did not close up again but stayed open, gray and bloodless, I guess because it was dead. Caleb put the metal lollipop in a bag and threw it in the trash along with his glove. \u201cWhat was it?\u201d I managed to ask. My legs were wobbly, and I\u2019d come close to losing my lunch. \u201cNo idea.\u201d \u201cBetter safe than sorry,\u201d the cremator said. \u201cDon\u2019t want to be putting the famous Wildes out of business.\u201d Caleb smiled. He was a tiny bit famous, as it turns out, and not just here in Parkesburg, Pennsylvania. He\u2019s been featured on the national news. His blog, Confessions of a Funeral Director, gets 500,000 hits a month. This has partly to do with his irreverent sense of humor\u200a\u2014\u200ahe once tweeted, \u201cI always tie the shoelaces together of the dead.

In our culture of face-lifts and fountain-of-youth diets, he seems to have struck a nerve. It\u2019s his self-professed mission to reacquaint us with the fact that we\u2019re going to die, and that it\u2019s most likely not going to be pretty. \u201cThe professionalization of death,\u201d as he puts it in his funny and illuminating TED talk, \u201chas left the rest of us death amateurs.\u201d As you can imagine, this doesn\u2019t sit too well with the average mortician, whose livelihood depends on this amateurism. Of course, Caleb is not your average mortician. He reads Kierkegaard and Grace Jantzen, the feminist theologian. There\u2019s a bit of the philosopher-poet about him. He calls death a \u201csacred space where we can embrace the silence.\u201d Perhaps there\u2019s no greater freedom, he says on his website, than to live life with a healthy relationship to death. Before he buries us, he wants to make us more human. Caleb covered the dead woman back up. \u201cBig, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s grease fire material.\u201d \u201cGrease fire?\u201d I asked. \u201cHave to be careful with the obese ones.

Earlier, he\u2019d shown me the bucket filled with titanium rods and pins that had come out of the ovens\u200a\u2014\u200aor \u201cretorts,\u201d as they call them in the industry. I\u2019ve seen many depressing things in my life, including my father\u2019s ashes, but this bucket of anonymous metal maybe takes the cake. \u201cDanger is they take all damn day to cook,\u201d the cremator said, \u201cand leak out on the floor.\u201d He watched me for a second to see how I\u2019d react, his eyes sort of twinkling and abashed at the same time, as if he were asking me to dance. Before I could formulate a response, his attention had moved on to lunch. \u201cHave you tried them Pogs down in Coatesville?\u201d he asked Caleb while they heaved the woman\u2019s body off its gurney. \u201cP-O-G-S. Hot dog wrapped in a slice of pizza. Best thing you\u2019ll ever eat, I tell you.\u201d Until that moment at the crematory, I had never seen a dead body up close. I\u2019d seen funeral pyres in India, and once a corpse bobbing facedown in the Ganges like a snorkeler. But I knew almost nothing about what happens to Americans after they\u2019ve breathed their last. Astonishing, if you think about it: that a person could live half his life without coming face-to-face with the one thing that unites us all. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in this. My father, like many of his generation, was sent to a hospice to die, then whisked away to a secret place where he reemerged after a couple days as a heartbreaking bag of ashes. There was something tooth fairy-like\u200a\u2014\u200athe unsightly thing vanishes, is transformed\u200a\u2014\u200aabout the whole business. Of course, we like to keep our distance in this way, which is why we pay the death fairies to take care of it. Americans don\u2019t like to talk about the inevitable: Our screens are filled with zombies, and yet speaking frankly about death is seen as \u201cmorbid\u201d or \u201cunhealthy.\u201d Surely the recent Ebola panic is a product of this repression, a way of turning our own mortality into a foreign threat, an illegal immigrant landing on our shores. Death is embarrassing to us, even a bit unpatriotic. I\u2019ve discovered this about my own fear of extinction. When I bring it up, people tend to shift in their chairs, as if holding in a fart. A look of impatience crosses their faces. Just as often, too, they can\u2019t understand what the hell I\u2019m talking about. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m afraid of dying, too. I don\u2019t want to suffer.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not talking about dying,\u201d I explain. \u201cDying only happens once. It doesn\u2019t scare me at all.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about then?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m talking about being dead.\u201d \u201cBut you won\u2019t know you\u2019re dead,\u201d the person says. \u201cYou\u2019ll be nothing.\u201d \u201cExactly!\u201d Not to be here/Not to be anywhere,/and soon; nothing more terrible, nothing more true. This is how Philip Larkin puts it in \u201cAubade,\u201d his great, merciless poem about waking up at 4 a.m. and thinking about the nothingness that awaits. I read it for the first time in college, and it spoke to me so much that for a while I thought I wanted to move to England and lurk among my own kind. I had been waking at 4 a.m. in breathless terror since I was seven years old, when my mother finally got around to telling me, a late bloomer in the critical-thinking department, that there was no such thing as Santa Claus. We\u2019d been talking about \u201cwhite lies\u201d at school, and so she found her opening. Immediately my personal Enlightenment began. If my parents had lied to me about Santa\u200a\u2014\u200awho seemed suddenly, grotesquely preposterous to me\u200a\u2014\u200awhat other whoppers had they told? I lay in bed that evening and stared at the ceiling and imagined a party going on up there on top of the house, a wild rooftop rager hosted by Santa Claus: There was the Easter Bunny and Bigfoot and the leprechauns and Paul Bunyan and the centaurs and Zeus and the angels and the devil and God with his long white beard, and when I closed my eyes they were all gone and I felt a stillness in my heart like someone was holding it. There was a terror I\u2019d never felt before, a feeling of cold, naked dread, as if my skin had blown open in a freezing wind. I even came up with a word for this feeling: \u201cfleshing.\u201d I fleshed mostly at night, when the house was dark and tomblike, though occasionally the dread would surprise me in the classroom or the kitchen or the backseat of our Oldsmobile, and I\u2019d have to pretend my chest hadn\u2019t blown open and turned me to ice. Even now, at age 44, I\u2019ve failed to outgrow it. I have done my best to be a good American, to immerse myself in the distractions of work and family\u200a\u2014\u200amy \u201cimmortality projects,\u201d as Ernest Becker puts it in The Denial of Death. I\u2019ve tried other distractions too. I\u2019ve drugged myself to sleep. I\u2019ve endeavored, in my weakest moments, to believe in heaven\u200a\u2014\u200aor at least some vague, harpless afterlife my brain won\u2019t snicker at. But I\u2019m still pretty much paralyzed with fear. So when I had the opportunity to meet Caleb Wilde, some perverse part of me jumped at the chance. Here was someone whose whole world was death, 24\u200a\u2014\u200a7, and yet he seemed to be doing okay. He wasn\u2019t distracting himself\u200a\u2014\u200ajust the opposite. He worked with dead people and their grieving families all day and then blogged about it. On his days off, he was getting a graduate degree in something called Death, Religion, and Culture. He even claimed that Death was his \u201cmuse.\u201d If someone was going to tell me how to look oblivion in the eye in order to make my peace with it, or at least stop being so fucking scared of the dark, here was the guy. When I got to Parkesburg, a town of 3,637 people\u200a\u2014\u200aall of whom would die someday\u200a\u2014\u200aCaleb was waiting by a van, looking sprightly and well-dressed. Sartorially, he sticks out in Amish country by wearing neither black felt hats nor Peterbilt caps, but nicely tailored suits. He greeted me with a puckish smile. I liked him immediately, and I can\u2019t a hundred percent explain why. He seemed bright and friendly and put-together, and there was a class-clown goofiness to him that was utterly at odds with his profession. \u201cSay hello to Mrs. McDonnell here,\u201d he said, sliding the van open to reveal a corpse covered in a red blanket. (I\u2019ve changed the name, for obvious reasons.) The corpse had a big belly. I didn\u2019t say hello, but I did nod. It felt like the right thing to do. My main impression was of a faintly comic stillness. I don\u2019t mean that it was funny, only that you expected Mrs. McDonnell to be there and she wasn\u2019t. Later, Caleb would tell me that around the dead he felt \u201ca void and a presence at the same time.\u201d We popped into the Wilde Funeral Home, an enormous brown Victorian that\u2019s been in the family since 1928 and is one of the few businesses left on Main Street. Caleb has described the Wildes\u2019 business, unironically, as the \u201ccivic heart of the community.\u201d Caleb\u2019s grandfather was born there, when the family lived upstairs, and he claims to have embalmed his first body at the age of six. Caleb himself grew up playing hide and seek among the caskets. There are paintings on the walls of old Parkesburg, back when it was a prosperous iron town, and statuettes of quails looking lost and homeless on the tables. In the office is a gallery of stone-faced Wildes, stretching all the way back to Caleb\u2019s great-great-great grandfather, who established the family trade and\u200a\u2014\u200aaccording to Wilde lore\u200a\u2014\u200asealed his fame in mortuary circles by preparing the body of Edward Gorsuch, the slave-owner killed in the Christiana riots. Even Caleb\u2019s mother, incredibly, comes from a line of undertakers. \u201cI\u2019m a thoroughbred,\u201d he told me. Caleb introduced me to his mom, who works in the office with his dad and his grandfather and his grandfather\u2019s brother. \u201cSo you\u2019re going on a ride along?\u201d she said. \u201cTo the morgue?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d I said. She gave me a strange look. \u201cExcited to go to the morgue? There must be something wrong with you.\u201d There is something wrong with me, I wanted to say, and I\u2019m hoping your son will help cure me of it. Caleb whisked me away and we were on the road to the hospital, Mrs. McDonnell riding along in back. It\u2019s an odd thing getting to know someone in close proximity to a corpse, though not as odd as you might hope. Caleb talked about his job with slightly ironic affection. He was articulate and funny and urbane. Aside from the occasional country-ism\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201ckeller\u201d for color; \u201cJagwire\u201d for Jaguar\u200a\u2014\u200ahe could pass for a stockbroker in Manhattan. I was eager to cross the river with him, my guide to the underworld, but it seemed like a bad idea to dive into my death-terror right off the bat. Instead we jawed about the business. Among the things I learned on the ride to the hospital: The fridges where bodies are kept are called \u201crefers\u201d (pronounced reefer). White people often want their dead relatives to look darker, while black people occasionally want them to look lighter. Sometimes, to reach an artery of a corpse, you have to peel back the scalp like the skin from a chicken. As it turns out, the morgue was not particularly exciting. Mostly it seemed to involve paperwork and waiting for the body to be retrieved. The overall impression was of someone picking up a package. I had the same sense of comic vacancy, watching Caleb wheel the long corpse into the van and park it next to Mrs. McDonnell, the tent poles of its feet sticking up under the blanket, though at some point on the continuation of our journey the body began to become a presence. Both of them did. Let me just say it was 85 degrees out, and humid, and the air-conditioning didn\u2019t work all that well. The crematory was an hour away. \u201cWere you ever tempted to find another line of work?\u201d I asked Caleb, trying to ignore the smell. \u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to be a pastor. I went to seminary.\u201d \u201cYou did?\u201d He explained to me that he\u2019d gone to Madagascar after high school with a Christian humanitarian group. It was an act of rebellion for a funeral director\u2019s son, to do something life-giving. He did that for two years, tracking medical supplies, before returning to the family fold. \u201cIt took me awhile to see that there was a lot of humanity in the funeral industry.\u201d I was surprised by his ever wanting to go into the ministry, though I probably shouldn\u2019t have been. Caleb\u2019s blog alludes sometimes to the \u201cfaith community,\u201d and in his TED talk, \u201cEmbracing Death,\u201d he brings up one of the paradoxes we face when a loved one dies: \u201cIn the same breath we curse God,\u201d he says, \u201cand praise God.\u201d As an atheist, both jealous and mistrustful of religious conviction, I wondered if he truly believed this. How could anyone exposed to so much daily death and heartbreak manage to praise God at all? Wasn\u2019t this just another form of denial? \u201cAre you still\u2026religious?\u201d \u201cDeath shakes your assumptive world,\u201d he said after a minute. \u201cWhen you go to pick up a body and it\u2019s been split in half by a train\u200a\u2014\u200aI mean, literally split in half, in two different parts\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s hard to believe in a just universe. At least in the Christian sense. But even as a teenager, you know, I was obsessed with the problem of evil. I couldn\u2019t get past it. I\u2019m sure being around dead people all the time had a lot to do with it.\u201d \u201cDo you believe in God then?\u201d He looked at the road. \u201cThat\u2019s a tough one,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly I\u2019ve had to redefine His existence.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s just say I\u2019m comfortable in silence.\u201d I stared at him for a moment, searching for signs of unease. It\u2019s what I longed to be, of course: comfortable in silence. Not just God\u2019s silence, but the pungent silence emanating from the back of the van. And the truth is, Caleb did seem comfortable. It was rare enough to meet an American who\u2019d talk earnestly about death without sounding like a Hallmark card; rarer still, I suspected, was the utter lack of fear in his eyes. There was something almost spooky about it\u200a\u2014\u200aa monkish sort of calm. The overall impression was of someone who\u2019d had a long staring contest with Death, and had won. As Caleb put it, you have to pass through death in order to get to Eden. \u201cDeath makes us better people,\u201d he said. \u201cI really believe that. The more we embrace mortality, the more human we become. We look deeper into things: our lives, our relationships, the earth even. We value these things more.\u201d He blushed a bit, as if he finally did sound like a Hallmark card. But that was the thing about death, I realized: You could look deep into its eyes and come up with the same bromides as someone who hadn\u2019t exchanged so much as a glance. Carpe diem. Count your blessings. Love the one you\u2019re with. They were only empty, these sayings, if no one had done the brave work to fill them. After dropping off the bodies at the crematory\u200a\u2014\u200awhere I saw him reach into poor Mrs. McDonnell\u2019s chest\u200a\u2014\u200aCaleb took me back to the mortuary and gave me a tour of the showroom, where the denial of death, or at least of decomposition, was on full display. Here were caskets of many colors, some with tropical flowers painted on them, designed to make oblivion seem as pink and mild-wintered as possible. Even if you went top-of-the-line, it was impossible to buy one that wasn\u2019t hideous. They were like Hawaiian shirts in that way, except a Hawaiian shirt that you would have to wear forever. Caleb showed me the cheapest casket for sale, a $900 number, which was made of pressed wood. It looked like I could punch a fist through it. He explained that many corporate funeral homes put their big-ticket models near the door and try to sell those first. \u201cGrief has a way of inebriating people so that they\u2019re easy to take advantage of.\u201d The Wildes, on the other hand, begin with the pressed wood and, only if a customer\u2019s truly interested, work their way up to the Worthington in solid cherry with velvet interior. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time they\u2019d sold a Worthington. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked, pointing to a metal tool displayed in one of the coffins. \u201cA key,\u201d Caleb said. He stuck it in one end of the casket and gave the thing a crank. \u201cThis one\u2019s a sealing casket. You can crank it \u2018til it\u2019s airtight.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBut the bodies decompose just the same.\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s psychological.\u201d I thought about the sealing casket that night, lying in my nice-smelling hotel room. (It didn\u2019t smell like death, I mean, which was nice.) Of all the white lies of the funeral industry, the airtight coffin seemed perhaps the most absurd: Even dead and artificially colored, pumped full of chemicals, we need to pretend we\u2019re special. We\u2019re different from the dirt! We\u2019re not dust in the wind, or pushing up daisies, or going into the fertilizer business. We\u2019re tourists flying home in a spotless vessel. As Caleb\u2019s uncle put it to me, describing his job at the funeral home: \u201cI\u2019m just the travel agent, you know, making sure their bags are all packed.\u201d Caleb, it should be mentioned, finds this dirt-phobia equally absurd. His dream in life is to start a \u201cgreen cemetery\u201d: no embalming, no vaults, biodegradable caskets. He hasn\u2019t mentioned this idea to his grandfather, perhaps because it threatens to undermine the branding of the funeral industry, which makes its living off keeping the realities of death as hush-hush as possible. Even ushering me around the showroom, Caleb was visibly uneasy, glancing back at the door now and then to make sure his grandfather wasn\u2019t around. When I asked about the embalming room, he said it was strictly off-limits. He seemed reluctant to even point out the door, which was drab and signless, tucked away in the farthest corner of the showroom. It looked like the door to a closet. Over the course of my visit it began to loom in my mind, twinkling with menace. I imagined it concealed unspeakable things, like the locked chamber in Bluebeard\u2019s castle: halved cadavers and peeled-back scalps and slimy pacemakers heaped in buckets. I lay in bed, thinking about all this, which led me inevitably to Caleb\u2019s hand snaking out of Mrs. McDonnell\u2019s body, the bit of flesh stuck to it like pumpkin goop. I couldn\u2019t get the image out of my mind. Likewise the calm, genial, lighthearted expression on Caleb\u2019s face. Was this\u200a\u2014\u200asticking his hands into death\u200a\u2014\u200awhat had inured him to it? Was his job a type of exposure therapy? I switched on the TV. Game of Thrones, which I\u2019d never seen before, was on. It was some grim and pretentious business. A bunch of bearded dudes were trapped inside a castle, waiting to be slaughtered. Mostly they walked around muttering about how scared they were. Before long the bad guys, a motley crew that seemed to include giants and woolly mammoths, stormed the castle and began to bash people\u2019s heads in like watermelons. Normally I was hardened to this sort of stuff\u200a\u2014\u200awho could go to the movies these days without seeing the insides of someone\u2019s head?\u200a\u2014\u200abut now I felt like I might actually throw up. What did it mean that this was one of the most popular shows in America? Why did we need our death porn and our sealed caskets, too? I watched someone\u2019s face get eaten by a dog, and someone else get juiced by a giant swinging anchor so that only his arm was left, then turned off the lights. It was dark in the way that hotel rooms are dark. I shut my eyes and tried to sleep. When I opened them again, I could make out the tentpoles of my feet sticking up under the comforter. The next morning, after a fitful night\u2019s sleep, I watched Caleb perform his real stock-in-trade: the funeral. The Wildes do 270 of them a year, but I was impressed by how seriously he took the business of grief, shaking everyone\u2019s hands as they arrived and offering his condolences. I shook some hands, too, feeling deeply ashamed at myself: a perfect stranger, insinuating myself into the worst day of a family\u2019s life. And yet it didn\u2019t seem like the worst day. People smiled and hugged and even joked with each other, as if the dead person lying in his open casket were merely napping on the couch. The deceased was a Freemason\u2014he had reached the 32nd of 33 levels, whatever that means\u2014so there was a certain pageantry to it as well: The men looked weirdly aristocratic in their tuxes and sashes and white gloves, their tasseled aprons covered in druggy symbols. Some even had medals hanging from their jackets. There was an Amish family there, too, and the two uniformed clans greeted each other with hugs. I tried to keep a respectful distance, watching the service unfold on the big-screen TV in the next room. The deceased looked realer on television for some reason, more human, the rounded peak of his belly sticking up over the casket. These enormous corpses! His jacket was a size too small for him. This touched me, for some reason, more than anything that I heard during the service\u200a\u2014\u200aexcept maybe the weird fact that he once spent $10,000 on an accordion. The man\u2019s father sat in the front row, and I wondered what it must be like to see your dead son. As a father of two kids, I could not imagine it. Terrified as I am of oblivion, I would never in a million years wish to outlast them. This is not a farewell service, the pastor began, it\u2019s a see ya later service. This\u200a\u2014\u200aheaven and the dear departed\u2019s eternal vacation there\u200a\u2014\u200aquickly emerged as his main theme. He said he knew that the deceased was up there in eternity with his accordion, right this very moment, accompanying the angels on their harps. They were jamming it up. This sounded like something that could make Satan beg for mercy\u200a\u2014\u200aharp-and-accordion music, \u2018til the end of time\u200a\u2014\u200abut it was hard to muster much Hitchens-like scorn. Life is fucking hard. People eat too much, and sometimes they die before their parents. Could you blame anyone for kidding themselves? After the service, I watched Caleb drape a coat over the widow\u2019s back and steer her to a car, steadying her with a hand under her elbow, providing her with a literal brand of emotional support, then saw him do this again a little later at the cemetery as he walked her down to her husband\u2019s open grave. He\u2019d told me the day before that one of the dangers of being a funeral director was \u201ccompassion fatigue,\u201d but I saw no evidence of this. Tending to the widow\u2019s grief, he couldn\u2019t have seemed further from the clich\u00e9 of the undertaker, the ghoulish thanatophile with an Addams Family grin. It struck me then that the funeral business, or at least the Wildes\u2019 mom-and-pop version of it, might be one of the last hands-on trades in America. Computers can\u2019t embalm people, nor can they console them in their grief, and you can\u2019t outsource bodies to \u201cskilled workers\u201d in other countries. Since demand is high\u200a\u2014\u200ais, in fact, guaranteed\u200a\u2014\u200athere\u2019s no need to create it out of thin air. There aren\u2019t that many businessmen out there that do some good in the world, let alone provide an essential service, but Caleb was one of them. I joined the crowd of mourners, watching from afar. It was a military burial, with guards of honor and a flag and a lone bugler playing \u201ctaps,\u201d and I was wholly unprepared for how beautiful it would be. The Pennsylvania countryside rolled Irishly into the distance, hay bales scattered everywhere like giant hair curlers, and the long, sorrowful notes seemed to fill the spaces between the hills. \u201cThat was some beautiful playing,\u201d I said afterward, as we were helping break down the canopy over the grave. \u201cActually, it was a recording,\u201d the cemetery guy said. \u201cBut he had a bugle.\u201d \u201cNot a real bugle. It\u2019s just a stereo that looks like one. You push play and hold it up to your lips.\u201d The man shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the batteries go out sometimes when they\u2019re halfway through. Talk about awkward. One time the damn thing quit and started playing later, from its case, smack dab in the middle of the eulogy.\u201d I found this hard to believe, but Caleb confirmed it. There just weren\u2019t enough bona fide buglers these days to go around. But the iBugle also pointed to a fundamental contradiction in the funeral industry: It was about tears, about the bona fide expression of grief, but it set about eliciting these tears in carefully staged ways. It strove for authenticity, but it was also a performance. And though I\u2019d begun to seriously admire Caleb, especially after what I\u2019d seen from him that morning, I wondered the same thing about his mortality-as-inspiration rap, his sangfroid in the face of all this death. Was he just pushing play? Or was it real? \u201cTell me, then,\u201d I asked Caleb when we stopped for lunch at a coffee shop owned by a very lonely Jamaican man who kept glancing at the door, as if expecting a herd of customers to arrive. An Amish buggy trundled by the window, bumping along the side of the highway. \u201cAre you not afraid of death?\u201d \u201cDying, yes\u200a\u2014\u200aI don\u2019t want to be in pain. But not death.\u201d My heart sank. Et tu, Brute? \u201cHasn\u2019t anything you\u2019ve seen on the job ever rattled you?\u201d I asked. \u201cI mean, made you wonder about the meaning of it all?\u201d He looked out the window. \u201cI had to be hospitalized once.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cThere was a trailer fire,\u201d he said, clearing his throat, \u201cand some kids were burned to death. A four-year-old and a nine-year-old. I mean, hideously burned. I worked on the bodies.\u201d \u201cYou embalmed them?\u201d \u201cNo. They were too bad off. But I had to determine if they were viewable. I mean, just seeing a four-year-old on a morgue table\u200a\u2014\u200athey look so small, it does something to you.\u201d He told me that the worst thing was the smell: \u201coily\u201d was how he described it. He breathed in so much of it that his piss reeked. \u201cEven my shit smelled of it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you had a breakdown?\u201d \u201cYou could call it that, I guess. I thought I\u2019d had an aneurysm. I collapsed on the street. Maybe I\u2019d just had too many Red Bulls.\u201d He smiled at me, but it wasn\u2019t the invincible smile I was used to. \u201cThere was all this stuff going on with the family, too. They were at each other\u2019s throats. Half of them were Wiccan, if you can believe that\u200a\u2014\u200athey wanted a witch to do the service. You can imagine how the Christian side, um, felt about that.\u201d I asked him if that was the only episode he\u2019d had, if anything like that had happened before. Everyone can have a bad day, of course\u200a\u2014\u200abut this seemed of a different order. \u201cAbout five years ago,\u201d he confessed, \u201cit was too much for me. I was having suicidal thoughts. I wanted to kill myself.\u201d He seemed surprised to be telling me this. \u201cI\u2019ve been on antidepressants ever since.\u201d I was reminded of a link Caleb had posted on his blog, an old obituary for an undertaker who\u2019d fallen into an open grave and been fatally wounded. I watched him finish his lunch. I felt the way you might feel when a person you\u2019d thought knew the way to somewhere, a native traveler, turned out to be as lost as you were. Mostly, though, the idea of smelling like dead children made me sad. Were there other things, I wondered, he hadn\u2019t told me about? Some things we see will remain with us forever, Caleb admits on his blog. They are so disturbing, so terrible, that we do the world a favor by not sharing them. Maybe there was no winning the staring contest with death. I was more than a little disappointed, though not in Caleb himself. His suffering made my terror seem quaint. Death wasn\u2019t some 4 a.m. abstraction whispering in his ear, but a part of his daily routine. It was literally inside of him. I thought about those burned kids lying on the embalming table, aged four and nine\u200a\u2014\u200athe exact ages, eerily, of my own children\u200a\u2014\u200aand I couldn\u2019t fathom what it would be like to look at them, let alone touch their ruined faces. This, it seemed to me, was Caleb\u2019s true role: to take on this burden, this knowledge, so the rest of us didn\u2019t have to. Caleb stood up to leave, yawning till his eyes watered. He looked exhausted. A touch resentful, too, as if I\u2019d unmasked him against his will. We left the coffee shop and drove back to the funeral home, passing a restaurant that had the statue of a giant rooster out front. \u201cNow that\u2019s a big cock,\u201d Caleb grinned, the mask back in place already. Since returning from Parkesburg, I\u2019ve thought a lot about what Caleb puts himself through every day. I\u2019d hoped that by exposing myself to death I would become inoculated somehow; I\u2019d wanted to see the bodies in Bluebeard\u2019s chamber. In the end, though, I was glad I didn\u2019t have the key. There\u2019s a danger in being too close to truth, just as there\u2019s a danger in being too far from it. Our brains seem almost hardwired to avoid thinking about extinction, or at least to deflect our fear into more productive areas. This is what terror management theory says, at least: that the values we create for ourselves\u200a\u2014\u200areligion, law, culture itself\u200a\u2014\u200aare a result of this deflection, the desire to create something that will outlive us. Death might be \u201cthe mother of beauty,\u201d as Wallace Stevens puts it, but it\u2019s the denial of death that makes life worth living. At the burial service that last day, after the bugler pretended to play \u201ctaps,\u201d the pastor read a poem called \u201cThe Dash.\u201d It was a dreadful poem, trite and sententious, about the dash between the dates on a headstone: For it matters not how much we own,The cars\u2026the house\u2026the cash.What matters is how we live and loveand how we spend our dash. There was something entrepreneurially inspirational about it (in fact, you can buy a T-shirt from the poet\u2019s website that says \u201cLIVE YOUR DASH!\u201d). I couldn\u2019t help wondering what Larkin, who didn\u2019t have an inspirational bone in his body, would have thought of it. Maybe he would have objected to the punctuation itself, the whole dismal convention of the dash. Wouldn\u2019t a slash be more accurate, or a colon? How about a question mark? Imagine, say, if our headstones read: \u201c1943\u00a0? 2014.\u201d Certainly this would do a better job of getting at the strangeness of being here to begin with. Our fear of death begets many things\u200a\u2014\u200aGod, good and bad poetry, wars without end\u200a\u2014\u200abut maybe it can also help us appreciate this strangeness, this flash of remarkable visions, by reminding us that they\u2019ll stop. I looked at Caleb, and it occurred to me that he\u2019d heard this poem many times before. It was the funeral industry\u2019s equivalent of \u201cThe Prophet.\u201d And yet he seemed genuinely moved by the proceedings. Afterward, the guards of honor folded the flag and everyone walked back to their cars\u200a\u2014\u200aeveryone, that is, except for the dead man\u2019s father. He would not leave his son\u2019s grave. Caleb had told me this happened occasionally: mourners refusing to leave the sides of their loved ones. The father stood there in his ancient-looking suit, shaking his cane at the casket. \u201cI\u2019ll be with you shortly, son,\u201d he said, trembling, \u201cI\u2019ll be with you shortly,\u201d and then Caleb took him by the arm and helped him turn away.

My goal is to develop natural ecosystems that produce food. My dream is a world with ready access to a diet that nourishes the body of the consumer, provides a living for the producer, and leaves the Earth joyfully habitable. I share that dream with a lot of people who call themselves permaculturalists, natural farmers, plantsmen, or foodies. I fear, however, that this doughty lot of green thumbs and stock-folk and food advocates is succumbing to tribalism; forgetting that saving the world means saving all of the people in it; even the ones that love cheap burgers and Coke. We\u2019re digging foxholes and making monsters out of people who don\u2019t agree with us, or who don\u2019t understand, or who do understand but are powerless to act. Take this quote by Dr. Daphne Miller\u200a\u2014\u200aauthor of one of my favorite books on the links between farming and health\u200a\u2014\u200aat the end of her interview with Slow Money Journal: As much as I admire Dr. Miller, this is among the more judgmental things I\u2019ve read outside of scripture. Among the implications: That\u2019s not what Dr. Miller wrote, but language is meaningless until it\u2019s interpreted in people\u2019s minds. That interpretation is informed by the economic, racial, political, religious, family, and personal backgrounds of the individual who processes it. Language complimenting one person is a heinous insult to another. Imagine how that earlier statement\u200a\u2014\u200afrom a Brown/Harvard educated M.D.\u200a\u2014\u200areads to a lower-middle income family with no savings. Dr. Miller\u2019s comment is owed, in part, to the echo chamber into which she was speaking; the same one into which nearly all of us \u201cclean food\u201d advocates speak. It\u2019s the one that asks easy questions and accepts facile non-solutions like \u201cpeople need to pay more for food,\u201d and \u201cpeople need to eat less meat.\u201d Folks like me have cultivated an insular world unencumbered by challenges beyond the margins\u200a\u2014\u200awe may disagree about technical details in rotationally-grazing livestock, but we short circuit when asked how our system could possibly scale to supply half the current global demand for beef. Most of us have never considered such an enormous question with any seriousness. We\u2019re surrounded by so much mutual love and affirmation that challenging ourselves doesn\u2019t seem necessary. We\u2019re generals on the eve of battle insisting we don\u2019t need to study the terrain; we will win because God is on our side. Clean food people\u2026 we\u2019re funny. We\u2019ll say all day long that people don\u2019t pay enough for food and they need to value food more. We\u2019ll even take the concept of going the extra mile to buy food with \u201cintegrity,\u201d turn it into a wedge, and drive it into the very heart of America, cleaving our collective body into the willing and unwilling. But call our products \u201chigh-end\u201d and we go absolutely apeshit. I\u2019ve heard all manner of gaslighting coughed into the air in defense of a $10/lb pork chop being called \u201caccessible\u201d (things I\u2019ve definitely said in the past): I sat on a panel with representatives from Timbercreek Market and Local Food Hub in front of an audience of about sixty people. We were all asked a question about the accessibility of Local food. They came to me last, after my co-panelists delivered answers in line with the bullets above; the same answers I certainly would have offered two years ago. I blurted out, irritated, \u201cour food is not accessible. It\u2019s just not. It\u2019s beyond the wallets of damn near everybody, it\u2019s the biggest problem with sustainable food systems, and we\u2019re criminally unserious about being leaders in sustainability until we propose solutions beyond economic relativism, wishful thinking, and see-sawing between charity on one hand and insisting that vulnerable, distracted people do all the heavy lifting of finding a way to afford our food on the other. And until we do start talking about those solutions\u2026 all this \u201csave the world\u201d stuff? It\u2019s all bullshit.\u201d A hush came over the room like I\u2019d just spilled some awful secret. The applause at the end of whatever else I said was long and loud. But I\u2019m probably not getting invited back to any VNRLI events. The food I produce is expensive. It\u2019s high-end. I have customers who really have to stretch to get it, and they let me know it. They\u2019re foregoing other creature comforts to help me make a living and keep the Earth of my grandmothers alive, and they\u2019re doing it not as a gastro-political vote of the food dollar or out of guilt for their carbon footprint, but as an act of love. They\u2019re holding our work and our mission to their hearts and saying \u201cI believe in you.\u201d I remember it when I\u2019m up to my shoulders in freezing water; when the inside of my truck reeks of four kinds of shit; when I come home covered in blood and muck; when I\u2019m hauling water in 100-degree heat; when I\u2019m herding pigs in a driving rainstorm and dodging lightning bolts to close up the hens. It reminds me that I\u2019m not alone. The energy they impart is worth infinitely more than money; it\u2019s the thing that lets me make a life as well as a living. And I\u2019ll dare not call that gift anything less than what it is in order to call my food something\u200a\u2014\u200alike \u2018accessible\u2019 \u2014that it is not. But not everyone can make that sacrifice. Nostalgia and misguided notions about peasant food aside, let\u2019s not pretend we really want to go back to the way food used to be. One of the great accomplishments of industrial food is an incredible leveling of what\u2019s on the plates of the rich and poor. The biggest difference between what you eat and what a billionaire eats will generally be how food is prepared instead of what food is prepared. Rich and poor alike all have routine access to chicken, pork, and beef\u200a\u2014\u200ayou might be surprised how recently that wasn\u2019t the case. And that abundance, especially of once-rare animal protein, has had substantial benefits for vulnerable people. Industrial food, however, hosts an array potent externalities: environmental degradation, western chronic disease, inequities in distribution. Clean food responds to this by championing non-industrial, artisan farming methods. This creates a higher quality but far more expensive product relative to the competition; we respond with aggressive marketing and the whole \u201cpeople need to value food more\u201d shtick aimed at the consumer who is able to spend those extra dollars. Meanwhile, the guy who is NOT able is rendered invisible by clean food\u2019s elitist marketing, which is strange because a.) clean food insists it\u2019s trying to save the world, yet b.) MOST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ARE THAT GUY. There\u2019s no solution for him except to put him at the mercy of various forms of feel-good charity. That seems fairly messed up. Also messed up: a foodie telling some poor little boy that he can\u2019t eat a 99 cent fast food cheeseburger because it doesn\u2019t have integrity. Telling him how easy it is instead to save his ducketts and maybe he can have a grass-fed house burger at the end of the month as a reward, but in the meantime get your protein from these canned beans that you can\u2019t actually bake because you don\u2019t have a stove and, even if you did, your mom works two jobs and moonlights as an Uber driver so she doesn\u2019t have time to heat that shit up anyway. There\u2019s no overstating how coarse it is for a person of means to have that attitude toward the poor. It\u2019s straight out of 18th century Versailles. Access to good food free of social and environmental externalities is a human right. It\u2019s for precisely this reason I don\u2019t bristle all that hard (any more) at the idea of cultured meat and hydroponics, even though I\u2019m a food-forest-loving permaculture farmer. The food I produce is economically out of range for a large number of people, but access to good food shouldn\u2019t be restricted to those who can afford to pay. Cultures and hydroponics could potentially scale to fill the affordability gap left by \u201ctraditional\u201d clean food without the externalities. If technology can offer decent, affordable meat to people without environmental side-effects, I don\u2019t have the right to reject that technology out of hand just because it\u2019s new, weird, or might threaten my revenue potential.* *You might ask, if cultured meat and hydroponics can feed the world, then why is your farm even necessary? The answer is that permaculture food forests\u200a\u2014\u200acomplete with trees, perennial plants, and livestock serving their critical functions in the water/mineral/energy cycles\u200a\u2014\u200aare critical to economically viable environmental conservation. No matter how far tech goes, we still need breathable air, clean water, fertile soil, greenspace, and all the food we can responsibly produce. \u201cClean Food\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athe kind grown in/on living soil, minimally processed, eaten closest to the point of harvest, etc.\u200a\u2014\u200ais part of the solution, not THE solution. Clean food advocates have to squarely recognize a.) the conflicts that exist at the intersection of environmental, social, and economic sustainability, b.) the disproportionate effects of those conflicts on the poor and lower-middle classes, and c.) the immorality and impracticality of insisting vulnerable people address those conflicts on their own, and judging them if they don\u2019t. We owe it to our customers, families, friends, and communities to be honest about where we fit in a sustainable future. If we\u2019re serious about saving the world, we also owe that honesty to people who will never be our customers. Finally, we owe that honesty to our mission and our own sanity\u200a\u2014\u200athe idea of this planet\u2019s future health and happiness left to a choice between the average person\u2019s pocketbook and their long-term moral considerations is a depressing notion with few precedents to buoy our hopes. So lets build our soil and grow good food. But let the folks in the lab do their thing, too. Like it or not, we\u2019re all depending on one another.

Traditionally the idea of a brand was much more visual\u200a\u2014\u200athink logos, a set color palette, certain imagery or type ramps. The brand was meant to encapsulate the set of values/mission of the company and the purpose of the brand was to communicate values, establish trust and credibility and a sense of identity to connect with their customer. To your customer, your brand is a mental picture of what your product/service represents\u200a\u2014\u200aand your goal was to convince your customer to see you as the best way to solve their specific problem. Instead, today\u2019s brand increasing incorporate written words as well as voice interfaces on platforms where they engage users. Put simply, devices are talking and people are listening. With more and more interactions taking place over conversational UI, brand voice is becoming a crucial part of a company\u2019s identity. It\u2019s an important dimension for which brands engage with their audience and also requires thought and guidance for how to best express a purposeful brand voice. What attributes do they have? What tone of voice do they use? Is it relevant to the context? Some examples of brand attributes: Another aspect to consider are the core values of your company. How do you want to be perceived by your customer in an ideal world? And does your chosen brand voice support these core values? Even if you have a broad audience, it can be helpful to identity a target audience and their goals. While these examples are broad, by focusing on your audience you can pick up specific attributes that you want to focus on and emphasize through your brand voice. The last step to a great brand voice is execution. Everyone in your company and team should be aware of these brand voice guidelines because they promote your companies mission and identity. Conveying a consistent written voice is key to building user trust and maintaining professionalism. Keep in mind that for something as complex and nuanced as voice, there may be high level principles/guidelines for how to write or speak for the brand on different platforms (like social media, website, mobile, documentation), but not set rules. Make sure to have a few examples in your guidelines to help everyone, from marketers to designers, better understand how to improve the brand voice. It can be challenging to clarify the many nuances in human speech but I find that going back to the idea of a brand as a person helps to define some high level principles for how the brand voice should sound. There is still a lot of work to be done on how to best refine brand voice guidelines and conversational interfaces. I hope these tips can help as a starting point toward defining your brand voice.

It feels a little flat, and the more I worry about it, the less I seem to enjoy writing. It feels a little like watching a pot of water just before the boil when those tiny bubbles cling to the bottom and sides, but refuse to let go. This is a dangerous spot for a writer to find themselves in if we don\u2019t have a way to work through it. Typically, I fly by the seat of my pants, swinging from one creative moment to the next like a manic monkey on crack. This sort of creative existence lends itself quite nicely to falling flat on your face from time to time because it\u2019s rather unpredictable. I regard these times as my slumpty dumpty period. There\u2019s a sweet spot in all human endeavors when everything falls seemlessly in to place. We feel as if we\u2019re responding to the orchestrations of a Presence beyond our limited perceptions. Motions are effortless. Inspiration flows from a bottomless wellspring and we are unbound from our perceived limitations. We\u2019re \u2018in the pocket,\u2019 as they say. I\u2019ve experienced moments like these in various creative pursuits, a few of them have even stuck in my memory like an old super eight film clicking through a dusty projector. These memories sometimes inspire me, but if I\u2019m in a creative slump they\u2019re more likely to haunt me. The infusion of endorphins during spontaneous inspiration is incredibly powerful, uplifting and addictive to creatives like me. I know it well, as a songwriter I\u2019ve chased this unique high most of my life. I\u2019ve often felt a blissful and cathartic release as a result, which seemed to instantly turn my emotional cart of apples right side up after a creative drought. Like magic, the world is infused with vibrant color once again, and I feel as if I\u2019ve been allowed to rejoin the current of life. Creativity demands renewal, and this sort of spontaneous freedom of expression is not entirely free, it requires something of us, an invested and willing presence. It takes discipline and dedication to seek out the conditions which might allow one to attain such a graceful release from the shackles of human expectations and experience. It also requires us to surrender the habit of looking backward, or forward in time and worrying about such places on the continuum where our power to influence is at its lowest. The essence of creativity and the accompanying freedom of expression demands our presence in the heart of the moment in order to be fully realized. Being writers, you and I know the value of inspiration and the exhilarating injection of adrenaline which courses through our veins when a plot and its characters crystalizes in our imagination, leaving us no choice but to frantically push everything else aside and set to writing. The timing in which the barrel bolt slides open to free one\u2019s imagination is crucial, the window of inspiration through which we fly may be unlatched only a short time before the muse flits off to the next writer poised with pen in hand, ready to follow her wherever she may lead. I\u2019m a tad bit on the rebellious side. I\u2019ve never cared much for the principle of discipline when applied to creative pursuits, but I\u2019ve marveled at those who can combine the two successfully. I concede to the benefits, but still, I must trick myself in a small way and regard my writing practices; however undisciplined they might be, as more of a compulsive dedication. Writers must be dedicated miners of thought and imagination, as well as, adept observers of human behavior. We must keep digging in the dark even when the only light we see is our own headlamps. Developing a routine of discipline which will allow us to keep the channel open is a good start. Adopting the habit of optimistic dedication to write through lumps of coal to reach the occasional diamond has given many a writer unexpected gifts of inspiration and fostered a multitude of brilliant and timeless classics throughout time. Besides, coal is one of the essential ingredient in making diamonds, is it not? \u00a9Slk.2018 By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

The outlet was recently engaged in an effort to ban a mobile app released by the Latvian State Language Center that allows users to report good and bad examples of Latvian language use. Vesti.lv is now making moves to consolidate its hold on pro-Russian and digitally native outlets in Latvia. One outlet which was involved in the anti-language app campaign and now under vesti.lv is focus.lv, which now redirects its readers to Vesti.lv via a subdomain at ru.focus.vesti.lv. The effort is a natural growth for a media company, as consolidating heavily trafficked websites allows Vesti.lv to grow its online readership statistics and rank higher on content discovery tools, like Google search. However, the strategy also adds to an already polarized political debate across the Baltics. On February 1, the Centre for East European Policy Studies presented a study on how international events are portrayed in Latvian online news portals. The full report concluded that Vesti.lv was the only Russian language media outlet in Latvia out of six surveyed that was clearly pro-Kremlin. The other two Russian media outlets\u200a\u2014\u200athe Russian language versions of Delfi.lv and Tvnet.lv\u200a\u2014\u200awere categorized as \u201chybrid\u201d. The authors of the study concluded: One aspect that remains unclear is who owns Vesti.lv. In March 2017, the Baltic Center for Investigative Journalism (Re:Baltica) published an article, which suggested the outlet\u2019s parent company Media Nams Vesti is officially owned by Ludmila Kalashnik. However, Russian-language journalists in Latvia believe the true owner is her partner Eduard Yanakov, a wealthy former member of the Russian State Duma. The current editor-in-chief of Vesti.lv Pavel Kirillov was previously editor-in-chief of two major Russian print newspapers in Latvia\u200a\u2014\u200aChas and Vesti Segodnya. The outlets merged in 2012 and later rebranded to simply being Segodnya. Currently, Media Nams Vesti is printing nine media outlets, including the daily newspaper Segodnya. Though no direct Russia-state ownership was identified, the content analysis carried out by the Centre for East European Policy Studies suggest that Vesti.lv systematically spread pro-Kremlin narratives in Latvia. As of November 2017, Vesti.lv had 229,802 unique visitors. It placed it among the top ten Latvian news sites according to market research agency Gemius Latvia. In December, Gemius Latvia reported that Vesti.lv achieved 283,644 visitors, which was the largest audience increase among top 25 websites with Latvian domain names. Continued increases in views throughout January 2018 made Vesti.lv rank as the 27th most visited website in Latvia according to a website analysis tool SimilarWeb. According to SimilarWeb, focus.lv is the fifth most common search term to drive organic traffic to the vesti.lv website. Focus.lv used to be a Latvian clickbait news site, but it now redirects to the Vesti subdomain focus.vesti.lv. This subdomain makes up over 22 percent of overall Vesti.lv traffic. Internet archive data suggested that the website Focus.lv and its Russian version ru.focus.lv were launched in February 2017. The website changed its domain to the Vesti.lv subdomain on November 30, 2017. There is not much information about the current owner of the focus.lv domain. The only publicly available information about the owner is an e-mail address latviafocus@gmail.com and a phone number. While this is not much to go by, the domain\u2019s historical data suggested that it was hosted on a server together with a few domain names of interest to the @DFRLab\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding nozagts.com and ukradeno.com, and tomajoki.com and shutkitoma.com. Nozagts.com is a clickbait site in Latvia. On December 2016, Latvian blogger Janis Polis published a blog post on the people behind the nozagts.com website. The blog post claimed that the sites owner was Ivan Stalnoy, a former leader of a youth organization Solidarity, who organized protests against secondary education taught only in Latvian language in 2001. In 2008, Stalnoy worked as a real estate broker at a company run by a Russian citizen Valery Engels. Engels\u2019 organization The World Without Nazism was later accused by the Latvian Security Police of promoting Russia\u2019s propaganda in Crimea. In 2009, Stalnoy defended a former journalist and current European parliamentarian Andrejs Mamikins, who was accused of promoting hate on television between ethnic Russians and Latvians. @DFRLab previously reported about Mamikins\u2019 activities defending so-called \u201cRussian schools\u201d in Latvia. Shortly after Polis\u2019 investigation, Latvian investigative journalism TV show De Facto discovered that Stalnoy consulted Riga municipality-owned public transport company Rigas Satiksme for three years and was employed in another Riga municipality-owned real estate company Rigas Namu Parvaldnieks. The show suggested that Stalnoy was employed in these companies thanks to his connections with the Concord party\u200a\u2014\u200athe most popular party promoting the Russian language community\u2019s interests in Latvia. Most recently, as investigated by Re:Baltica, Stalnoy worked as a consultant for Vesti.lv to help promote the site\u2019s content online. The current traffic acquisition from Focus.lv followed a similar pattern to what Nozagts.com did in December 2016. According to a Google search, the first publication with the nozagts.com domain was on November 3. It used the subdomain tomajoki.nozagts.com. Tomajoki or tomstv.lv was the 15th most popular webpage in Latvia in 2016. Its content was mostly clickbait entertainment and internet jokes. It is difficult to verify whether the domain tomstv.lv redirected to tomajoki.com (a domain hosted on the Focus.lv server), nevertheless, the Wayback Machine web archive showed the webpage tomstv.lv existed until June 8, 2017. The Nozagts.com domain functioned at least until September 8, 2017, so it is likely that tomstv.lv redirected to nozagts.com domain after it was acquired by Ivan Stalnoy on December 4, 2016. Since February 2017, Focus.lv created at least five new subdomains using variations of the Tomajoki and Nozagts.com brands. The most popular Focus.lv subdomains were Tomajoki and Ukradeno (\u201cnozagts\u201d translates as \u201cstolen\u201d in English and \u201cukradeno\u201d in Russian). Nonetheless, the network of websites and increased traffic showed the main functionality of Focus.lv domain now is to increase Vesti.lv digital rankings. The pro-Kremlin media outlet in Latvia Vesti.lv started to acquire the readership of clickbait site Focus.lv since at least November 30, 2017. Historically, Focus.lv accumulated the audience of two clickbait sites Nozagts.com and Tomajoki. While Tomajoki was publishing entertainment and internet jokes, Nozagts.com was writing about social and political meters with a bottom-line that everything was bad in Latvia. Nozagts.com became well-known after Latvian journalists discovered its connection with pro-Kremlin activist Ivan Stalnoy, who recently consulted Vesti.lv to help promote the site\u2019s content online. The data by the web analytic tool SimilarWeb showed that Vesti.lv traffic is growing. While the strategy of domain consolidation and audience growth is natural for any media company, particularly a digitally native outlet, moves by vesti.lv demonstrated potential for more coordinated content on politically polarizing topics across Latvia.

And sometimes I re-read it\u2026 to remind myself of everything Sara Blakely taught me. She\u2019s a self-made billionaire. She\u2019s the founder and creator of Spanx. All of her advice (learned directly from DOING) is still impacting me today. Some people are inspirations for life. Sara is one of those people. Sara Blakely is weird. I wish I could think like she does. I want to be weird like her. \u201cI look at any object and try to think of any use it has other than what people had planned for it.\u201d And then she acts on it. She sees a pair of pantyhose, cuts off the feet (why not?) and creates a multi-billion dollar company, Spanx. She sees her 9 month pregnant belly and paints a basketball on it. And then inspires hundreds of other women to do the same. Creates a book out of it: The Belly Art Project, and donates the proceeds to charity. \u201cAll my life I was taught how to deal with failure,\u201d she told me. \u201cMy dad would ask us at the dinner table every night: how did you fail today?\u201d HOW DID YOU FAIL TODAY? She got comfortable with failure at an age when every other kid wants to get an A+ at everything. She got comfortable embarrassing herself. For two years she tried to be a standup comedian. \u201cI wasn\u2019t very good at it.\u201d Practice embarrassing yourself\u2026 She got a huge order from Nieman Marcus even though she didn\u2019t have the inventory or the production ready. She said, \u201cYES!\u201d. Then she figured out how to get the order filled. Oprah listed Spanx as one of her \u201cfavorite things\u201d of 2000. Oprah wanted to film her office. Sara had no office. She said, \u201cYES!\u201d. Then she got an office and filled it up with people. Say YES! Then make things happen. Don\u2019t argue yourself into failure. Excuses are easy. Saying \u201cyes\u201d and then executing is hard. \u201cIt takes me five minutes to drive to work,\u201d she told me. \u201cBut I take 45 minutes. I use that time to think.\u201d It\u2019s important to think. To be creative every day. This is how she comes up with non-stop ideas to expand her brand, expand her products, and work on other projects. I suspect this is the secret for how she always sees things differently. Being creative is a practice. It\u2019s not lightening from above. It\u2019s taking the long route when you could\u2019ve taken the short route. While I was talking to Sara she used the word \u201cempower\u201d several times. Spanx clothes gives women more confidence. Empowers women. The Belly Art Project empowers pregnant women. It seems like there are three parts to a project that leads to master salesmanship. - the higher purpose for it. This gets people excited. - the actual product and its benefits. - execution Combine all three and people will get infected with your passion for your ideas. Sara was unstoppable. Don\u2019t engage with the people who want to argue with you. That\u2019s time wasted when you can be creative. Once you\u2019ve worked on your project, have passion for it, started it, be willing to take suggestions and listen to people. Ego can kill a project and close the door on good opportunities. Sara was selling fax machines for five years before fully launching Spanx. She could still be selling them if she never started. If she listened to all the people who tried to dissuade her. If she became afraid of the multi-billion dollar companies that could have easily squashed her. Except they didn\u2019t. She was one person and they were billions. But they lost. We are here only this precious small amount of time. Make every moment a work of art. Make every moment move you one step forward towards your dream and purpose. Invent a new undergarment even if you had never made clothes in your life. Get 100s of women to paint their pregnant bellies and then raise money for charity with the idea. \u201cEVERYTHING IS A CANVAS,\u201d she told me. Which makes everyone a potential artist. What a great way to look at life. But I can\u2019t! Why not? For anything you want to do, for anything that excites you, take the time to figure out the next step. Ready. Fire. Aim. Just why not? Why not? Thanks so much for listening! If you like this episode, please subscribe to \u201cThe James Altucher Show\u201d to rate and review!

The movie \u201cSilence of the Lambs\u201d is about a heroic FBI agent who willingly endures intense mental, and emotional trauma, in order to save another woman\u2019s life. Someone she had never met. In real life, FBI agents have been responsible for keeping large groups of us, as in: you, me, our friends, our families, and whatever pets we may have, FROM EXPLODING WHILE ON FIRE, with flaming chunks of us flying off in all directions, due to lunatics who like to blow people up. And, dudes and dude-ettes, let me inform you, if you knew how OFTEN this happens, you\u2019d be digging a shelter right now, by yourself, with a shovel, and be far too busy to be reading this article, even though it\u2019s FUN, and INFORMATIVE. Many FBI agents are unsung heroes, and many have died in the line of duty. Now, I\u2019m sure if we look throughout the entire history of the FBI there would be stuff that upsets or disturbs us.\u200a\u2014\u200aAnd guess what? EVERY thing in this country has this in common. Here\u2019s how. This country started, when we came here and killed everyone we saw. (Here\u2019s what they looked like after we raped and murdered almost all of them). :( (Some of them wore a headdress or feathers in their hair, so they looked like this). =:( This all happened shortly before we got into other weird stuff, like -slavery. Centuries later, WE, as in, America, our very own government, THAT WE ELECTED TO LOOK OUT FOR OUR INTERESTS, funded the \u201cTuskegee Syphilis Experiments\u201d in (SURPRISE!) Alabama. Where they gave SYPHILIS to African American men, (who, FUN FACT: are actual human beings, from Earth), and then, after infecting them WITH SYPHILIS, studied it BEING LEFT UNTREATED over the course of FOUR DECADES. (\u2026I know, right?). It stopped in 1972, when someone sane somehow intervened, and said, in a famous quote: \u201cwait\u2026 WHAT?!?\u201d We also did some fun stuff, like: when we\u2019d release germs onto our own people from boats, to test out some germ distribution stuff we were working on\u2026 we\u2019ve also gotten rid of democratically elected leaders in other countries and replaced them with insane madmen,\u2026 we sold weapons to the \u201crebel forces\u201d who went on to invent \u201c911\u201d. Point is we, as a country, have done WEIRD S**T\u2026 So, keeping in mind we have a somewhat morally checkered past, let\u2019s now turn our weary gaze towards the FBI. The FBI, historically, is a CONSERVATIVE outfit. For example, James Comey, was, in fact, a Republican, up untill the moment that Donald Trump SCARED THE LIVING BEJEEZUS OUT OF HIM, FORCING HIM TO HIDE IN SOME CURTAINS, like Jamie Lee Curtis in \u201cHalloween\u201d. This advanced FBI stealth curtain technique, may well have saved Comey\u2019s life, and definitely saved him from being sexually assaulted. Until this occurred, Comey was a REGISTERED REPUBLICAN. Robert Mueller = a REGISTERED REPUBLICAN. Rod Rosenstein = a REGISTERED REPUBLICAN. So\u2026 now, we learn, through the GOP Vampire Glee Club, and their castrato*, Devin Nunes, that\u200a\u2014\u200athe Democrats are something something Deep State, and something FBI, and something secret memo!\u2014 Got it. So, let\u2019s look at some more FUN FACTS:\u00a0*(castrato: a male singer, castrated before puberty). Now, a MEMO\u2026 was released by famed Fred Flinstone impersonator, Devin Nunes, pictured here talking to a Russian spy: Nunes is famous for giving (famed international money launderer, and KKK poster-boy), Donald Trump, info ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION AGAINST TRUMP, WHICH NUNES WAS IN CHARGE OF. (I know, right?) This happened on March 21, 2017. Nunes hopped into a self-prepelled car (made of stone), in the dead of night, and banged on the White House doors shouting \u201cWILMA!\u201d, (after being locked out of the White House by a large, prehistoric, sentient cat). Here\u2019s that. Since then, Nunes has done other insanely suspicious things, such as: recuse himself from the Russian investigation, then\u00a0, un-recuse himself, then, recusing himself just for the times when he\u2019s asleep, and then un-recusing himself whenever he\u2019s awake, and wants to give secrets from the investigative committee, directly to Trump, or, when he comes up with cockamamie memos in order to attempt to destroy the DOJ and FBI. So, to my friends in the FBI and all other known US intelligence agencies, in the words of Homer J. Simpson \u201cThis has gone on just long enough\u201d. It might be time to coordinate your efforts to rid us of some mad-men who are spookier than they should ever be allowed to be, and think they\u2019re above all known laws. Seriously, let\u2019s look into whether Nunes ever went to Russia and stayed at the opulent \u201cPutin Country Inn\u201d, which has 117 active cameras in every room and also, has cold AND tepid running water. Or WHO\u2019S BLACKMAILING NUNES, to make him act in such an idiotic manner (in his defense of a befuddled maniac that commits treason on a daily basis). We\u2019re now looking to you guys, the so called \u201cDeep State\u201d to rid us of a certain effing lunatic who\u2019ll otherwise wind up killing us all by tweeting World War 3, and also ridding us of all the vermin he brought along with him for the ride.

My boyfriend tilted his head back and stared up at the sky, which was gray but not particularly menacing. Then he looked at his own phone. \u201cThe Weather Channel app says 30 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cSo maybe we stay a little longer?\u201d George shrugged and put his phone back in his pocket. We went back to talking, but our eyes strayed up. Weather is typically derided as boring, \u201cthe last refuge of the unimaginative\u201d attributed to Oscar Wilde, but this had become a competition\u200a\u2014\u200awhose app was better\u200a\u2014\u200aand we all had something to lose, namely dry clothes and decent hair. \u201cWas that a drop?\u201d we asked at intervals, studying the sky for secrets. I have a theory that Wilde pooh-poohed weather because meteorology was invented in his lifetime\u200a\u2014\u200ahe was sick of hearing people talk about this newly predictable thing. Before the 1860s, people attempted with limited success to understand the weather by observing animal behavior (e.g., if an anthill closed there\u2019d be a thunderstorm) or planetary movements or \u201crings and halos\u201d in the sky. Now forecasts are 95 to 97 percent accurate, according to a spokesman for the American Meterological Association\u200a\u2014\u200abetter than many forms of birth control\u200a\u2014\u200aand forecasting is omnipresent, helping us decide what to wear, how to commute, where and when to socialize, and whether or not we travel. But we don\u2019t follow forecasts only for practical reasons. In our era of climate change, weather news is essentially the ultimate reality show, all of us spectators and members of the cast. I\u2019d experienced both the former and latter during Hurricane Sandy. When the superstorm hit New York City, I\u2019d only recently moved into my own place, sans roommates, and was riding an independence kick that resulted in me crouching alone in my dark studio apartment, wearing a bike helmet and listening to weather on a battery-powered radio because the smartphone I\u2019d finally caved and bought hadn\u2019t arrived yet. Through the long, wind-whipped night, weather news was my only connection to the world. A lot of other people must have felt the same way, because The Weather Channel\u2019s network ratings sailed off the charts during Sandy, and the tech industry was right on the network\u2019s heels. Apple had just added weather updates to its operating system a year before, after Hurricane Irene. Since these hurricanes, plus typhoons Bopha and Haiyan in the Philippines and droughts (least sexy but one of the most deadly of weather calamities) across Africa and the Americas, the internet has become a nonstop weather report: essays of loss, videos of wild surf, calls to action by relief organizations, and photos of flooded streets, ravaged buildings, and gloomy farmers. \u201cWeather is nonpartisan,\u201d Harry Enten, senior political writer at ESPN\u2019s FiveThirtyEight, admitted weatherphile, and longtime daily forecaster, told me when I asked why he spends his free time writing weather forecasts. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t upset people one way or another, but everyone cares.\u201d Back in Prospect Park, exactly 12 minutes after George made his prediction, we felt the first drops. We ran for shelter in one of the tunnels off the great lawn, followed by other park-goers who\u2019d been less prepared to dash at a moment\u2019s notice. \u201cSorry, guys,\u201d said my boyfriend, but his sheepishness was quickly overrun by curiosity, and as the rain roared overhead he got out his phone. \u201cHey, George, what\u2019s that app called?\u201d It\u2019s likely no accident that Sandy coincided with the dawn of the weather app era. The Weather Channel and Yahoo Weather are now among the 15 most-downloaded apps across all platforms, according to an April 2014 ComScore report\u200a\u2014\u200aputting them in the same league as Facebook, Google Maps, and Gmail. This is doubly impressive considering the iTunes app store alone has 1.2 million apps and counting, and Yahoo and Weather Channel are competing against thousands of other weather apps: Weather Underground for statheads, FishWeather for outdoorsmen, Authentic Weather for cynics, Solar for aesthetes, Weather Puppy for cuteness enthusiasts, and Surfline for San Diegans who, though their weather varies little, scratch their forecasting itch by keeping up with changes in tide and swell. It\u2019s safe to say there\u2019s a weather app for every member of your extended family\u200a\u2014\u200aeven your too-cool-for-a-smartphone cousin can sign up for Poncho, which delivers a customized weather report via text or email every morning. Yet for all the variety and high download rates, weather apps are essentially needless: The average smartphone comes with built-in weather, and almost all apps forecast using the same National Weather Service data anyway. Dark Sky was the app George used to keep us dry that day in Prospect Park, and though it costs $3.99\u200a\u2014\u200aa fortune in app world\u200a\u2014\u200amy boyfriend downloaded it, and our days became punctuated by hyper-specific reports: rain in four minutes, sun in six, mostly cloudy for the hour. These short-term forecasts are the result of \u201cnowcasting,\u201d a method that relies on real-time data for specific locations. Though a couple other nowcasting apps came out around the same time as Dark Sky\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding RainAware and Ourcast\u200a\u2014\u200afounder Adam Grossman was drawn to nowcasting on his own when he and his then-girlfriend (now wife) got stuck in a restaurant during a rainstorm. Debating whether to make a run for the car or wait it out, he checked his weather app (he thinks it was The Weather Channel), \u201c40 percent chance of rain,\u201d says Grossman, \u201cFat lot of good that would do us! We got drenched. We were grumpy. There had to be a better way to predict rainstorms in the immediate future.\u201d Two years later, a demo version of the app saved their wedding party from a soaking. Dark Sky is by far the most user-friendly of the nowcasting apps, and since mid-2013 Grossman and his co-founder Jay LaPorte have also offered their own forecasting service: Forecast.io uses multiple sources of raw data, above and beyond the standard NWS data most apps rely on, to provide Dark Sky with its predictions, giving it yet another edge over other weather apps. Today Dark Sky is the second-highest-grossing weather app in iPhone\u2019s app store\u200a\u2014\u200asecond only to ForeFlight Mobile, an app designed for airplane pilots. Soon I, too, succumbed to the four-dollar temptation, adding Dark Sky to my weather folder along with Solar, Yahoo, NOAA, and (embarrassingly) Weather Puppy\u200a\u2014\u200aall of which keep me connected to what\u2019s happening with winds and tides in a way I\u2019ve found myself needing since that night alone with my radio during Sandy. It\u2019s not just me: the American Psychological Association recently released a report on the psychological effects of climate change. Spoiler alert: We\u2019re all screwed. PTSD, depression, anxiety, and aggression are just a few of the delightful moods we can look forward to as the weather grows more variable and intense. I suspect our extreme emotions are largely due to our inability to escape. While the U.S. reported a record 14 billion-dollar disasters in 2011, and 11 disasters in 2012 that totaled an even greater sum, 2013 set a global record: 41 billion-dollar disasters, including droughts in Brazil, flooding in Central Europe and Northern India, and Super Typhoon Haiyan in the Phillippines\u200a\u2014\u200athe last of which may be the strongest hurricane ever observed. Statisticians haven\u2019t yet swung in to measure 2014\u2019s damage, but according to Oxfam, each year since 2009 has been among the top 10 most expensive on record in terms of weather damage. In such a world, nowcasting\u200a\u2014\u200aa strategy other apps are also adopting\u200a\u2014\u200aoffers the user an illusion of power that seems to get at the heart of why we like weather apps so much: Weather forecasts fulfill our inborn desire to know what\u2019s going to happen, thus giving us a semblance of control; weather apps put that power in your pocket. I spent more than a week after Hurricane Sandy at a friend\u2019s place\u200a\u2014\u200aher electricity was still on, while mine seemed busted indefinitely. When ConEd finally called to tell me I\u2019d regained power, I joined the rest of the city in groggily waking from our collective post-Sandy stupor. I took the newly reopened subway back to my place, my hard-earned independence stinking of tuna gone bad in the fridge. I opened the mud-splattered windows, made a trip to the overflowing garbage in the basement, and got on my bike, bound for the UPS on Houston Street. After much back and forth, I\u2019d learned that the phone I\u2019d ordered was probably there, but nobody was sure. When I arrived I realized why: the building had flooded and the system was down, which meant that a very kind man spent two hours searching for a package he would\u2019ve normally been able to find in two minutes. Finally he emerged from the gloom, triumphant. There are those who say technology is ruining us, and those who say it\u2019s changing the world for the better. Probably both are correct to some degree. All I know is that when I held that phone in my hand, after a week of checking weather on shoddy WiFi and trying to call my mom from borrowed phones that had no reception anyway, I finally felt normal again: connected, powerful, yet independent. In the sense that we\u2019re at its mercy, weather infantilizes all of us.

Usually I don\u2019t come up with the title until after having written the post. The reason for the change this time is because this title is a phrase that\u2019s been blaring in my head for so long. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve wanted to shout from the roof tops above the popular (and often misled) notion of today\u2019s culture that tells people to \u201cjust follow your heart.\u201d Telling someone to follow their heart is bad advice. Really bad advice. The heart is emotional and therefore fickle. If everyone went with every whim that came to their hearts, the world would be a lot more chaotic than it already is. There\u2019s definitely something to be said for self-control. And this is not just common sense, it\u2019s also biblical. What this means is, as humans our hearts are inclined toward selfishness and sin, and therefore some decisions made with the heart are made with the wrong motives. Passion is different from heart. Passion is something that burns deep inside your gut, propelling you forward despite whatever you\u2019re feeling in the moment. It\u2019s what keeps you going and working hard even when things get tough, even when your heart doesn\u2019t feel like complying. Passion is oftentimes more committed than the heart. I think this quote says it best: Think about this quote in terms of those who are passionate about running marathons. To be successful, it can\u2019t be just because their heart loves running or likes the euphoria that comes with running. If that was the case, they would quickly give up during training when they experienced the pulled muscles, the bleeding blisters, the extreme exhaustion, the harsh elements of outdoor running, and so on. I\u2019ve been guilty in my past of making decisions with the wrong motives and chose to follow my heart instead of my gut. I know from personal experience that each time I\u2019ve ignored my gut I\u2019ve regretted it. And each time I\u2019ve listened to it, I\u2019m glad I did. So what\u2019s the difference between following your heart and following your passion? Following your heart is an attempt to gain immediate gratification. It\u2019s impulsive. It doesn\u2019t weigh the consequences. Its desires are temporary. And it doesn\u2019t want to tolerate the suffering required for results. Following your passion is committing to something you know you must do. Even when it scares you. Even when it\u2019s difficult. Even when you\u2019re tired. Even when there\u2019s some suffering involved. It\u2019s taking the time to do your research, make a plan and count the costs. It\u2019s being responsible to your gut, instead of a slave to your heart. When it comes to the big decisions in your life, which would you rather base those pivotal decisions on: pop psychology fluff, or truth? Will you follow your heart, or will you follow your PASSION?

You and I read many articles both on and off of Medium about strategies on how to get your articles published, how to get many followers, etc. I don\u2019t deny their value, but being so good at something goes a long way. In 41 Short And Powerful Quotes To Make You Feel Unstoppable, I shared the following quote: But I know what you\u2019re saying now: \u201cI\u2019m good, but no one notices or remembers me!\u201d Well, I\u2019m proposing the following ways to change that: Are you good or are you great? That is the question. In his book titled \u201cGood To Great\u201d, Jim Collins said it right: Be honest with yourself. Are you good? Are you great? Analyze the great. Surround yourself with the great and you\u2019ll become great yourself. Never strive for good. Make A Good Impression. If I need a business card to remember you, you failed to make a good enough impression. When you network with people, do you stand out? What makes you more interesting than others? A lot of times, you call tell if someone\u2019s an impostor or not. If you are one, be sure to be a damn good actor to live up to it! If you read my other stories, I almost always share my own experiences about the subject I\u2019m writing about. It\u2019s no coincidence. I lived these things. People trust people who are honest, vulnerable and know what they are talking about. Find your niche. Tell your stories. Give your own perspective on a valuable life lesson you learned. Don\u2019t just grab stuff from the internet you think may work for people. No one likes a hater. The stories I write that can be perceived as negative are much less popular than the positive ones. People want to feel good. Showing a positive attitude in the midst of a crisis will get you recognized. Be encouraging. Be grateful. Do things consistently. I personally love that one. I write one story a day. I\u2019ve been doing it consistently for 41 days now. In this short period of time, I got published and became a top writer in 6 categories here on Medium. Being truly great, interesting, authentic, positive and consistent are sure ways to get noticed and remembered. Obviously, it\u2019s easier said than done. But be honest with yourself. Be aware of your behaviour and your surroundings. Take notes. Improve yourself in these 5 ways and your \u201cluck\u201d will turn up. You can do this!

Translation: Expect cuts in the social safety net. As the path of the Republican tax plan toward passage grew clearer, so did the threat to the social safety net. With major, permanent tax cuts for corporations, and by extension the wealthiest Americans, and (temporary) tax cuts to individuals that also disproportionately benefit the wealthy, experts argue this bill will contribute as much as $1.5 trillion to the deficit. House Speaker Paul Ryan and his Republican colleagues have made clear that they intend to use the social safety net to finance the tax cuts. Said Republican Representative Rod Blum, \u201cFor us to achieve three percent GDP growth over the next 10 years from tax reform, we have to have welfare reform.\u201d Now that the bill has passed and been signed into law, the threat to the social safety net is existential. While making the rounds on the various morning talk shows boasting of the Republicans\u2019 \u201caccomplishment,\u201d Speaker Ryan argued (and Trump later echoed), \u201cPeople want able-bodied people who are on welfare to go to work, they want us to get people out of poverty, into the workforce.\u201d It\u2019s hard to understand the logic behind undermining the funding streams for programs that keep people out of poverty in order to \u201cget people out of poverty,\u201d but clearly the Speaker is not the only one who subscribes to that line of thinking. Reports suggest that the White House is finalizing an executive order demanding a review of the federal programs that comprise the social safety net. One can only presume that the conclusions of this review will justify major changes to the programs conservatives have derided for years as wasteful and ineffective. On the potential chopping block are the traditional targets: the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, often called food stamps), housing assistance programs, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF, a cash assistance program), and health care. Even now the White House is allowing states to apply new work requirements to certain Medicaid enrollees, potentially undermining their access to care. Meanwhile, congressional Republicans are reportedly quietly writing legislation that could tighten eligibility standards for social safety net programs, in ways that could collectively remove millions from the rosters. SNAP seems to be particularly vulnerable. At the beginning of December, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the program, circulated a memothat promised \u201ccoming flexibilities aimed at transitioning people into independence.\u201d Flexibility is a well-known code word for policies that empower states to attach more stringent work requirements and drug tests with an eye toward, again, excising current enrollees. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perduealluded to these changes himself at the end of January. In October, Congress passed a joint budget resolution that loosely codified proposed cuts to the social safety net over the next 10 years. An analysis from the Urban Institute offers some insight as to what \u201cwelfare reform\u201d might specifically entail and what is at stake should it come to fruition. In the event that flexibilities translate into restricting benefit access, changes to SNAP would affect 23.4 million families who would lose about $600 per year per family, or stated another way, 430 meals annually. Of those families, almost 20 million would see a reduction in their SNAP benefits. The rest would totally lose their access to SNAP. Anticipated reductions to the federal contribution to TANF was estimated to impact 260,000 families throughout the country in the form of $2,580 less each year in distributed TANF assistance. Progressives knew exactly whom to thank for the defeat of accused child molester and Republican candidate Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate election\u200a\u2014\u200ablack voters, who turned out in unprecedented numbers to vote for Democratic candidate Doug Jones. In the aftermath of Jones\u2019 upset, social media was flooded with posts thanking black Alabamians, particularly black women, for \u201csaving America\u201d from its worst impulses. At least one member of the national Democratic Party apparatus agreed: Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez asserted, \u201cLet me be clear: We won in Alabama and Virginia because black women led us to victory. Black women are the backbone of the Democratic Party, and we can\u2019t take that for granted. Period.\u201d If progressive Americans, voters, activists, and politicians are serious about giving more than verbal acknowledgement to black voters for protecting the country from extremism (and the subsequent embarrassment of having to seat an alleged child molester in the United States Senate), then they must proactively take actions to protect black voters, especially poor ones. Such actions should begin with ensuring that the social safety net programs that are most impactful for disenfranchised black voters be maintained (or expanded) and not diminished, as it appears congressional Republicans are poised to do. To be sure, congressional Democrats have so far held the line in opposing Republicans\u2019 efforts to weaken the social safety net and generally debilitate poor Americans. Not a single Democrat voted for House Republicans\u2019 American Health Care Act, which attempted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Not a single Democrat voted for any version of the Senate Republicans\u2019 ACA repeal legislation. Congressional Democrats must continue to hold the line. They may be the minority party in both houses of Congress, but they have a number of powerful legislative and administrative tools at their disposal, including the filibuster and the budget writing process. For proof of their effectiveness, look no further than the DACA debate: The overwhelming majority of Democrats banded together to prevent congressional Republicans (and President Trump) from sabotagingDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u2019 Dreamers during the government shutdown dispute. In doing so, the Democrats in the Senate were able to bring Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to the table to discuss a bipartisan DACA solution. These tools must be employed to stop congressional Republicans from undermining the social safety net because a weakened social safety net would spell disaster for black Americans across the country. Although black Americans are only 13 percent of the total population, they comprise 22 percent of the country\u2019s poor. High rates of unemployment and low wages, the result of generations of commingling of economic oppression and institutionalized racism, have depreciated black incomes and wealth to the extent that in 2011, black Americans took home only 59 cents for every dollarwhite households did. Black Americans have the lowest household incomeamong all racial groups, which has translated into few opportunities to build wealth. Black Americans had a median liquid wealth of $200 as compared to $23,000 for whites in 2011. Poverty has an unusually tight grip on the black community: Most black Americans who are born poor remain poor into adulthood. Middle-class black families are not immune from this grip either. Black Americans are uniquely downwardly mobile, especially compared to whites, with 70 percent of middle-income black Americans joining the ranks of lower-income Americans by adulthood. Even the nature of black poverty is different. Unlike poor whites, poor blacks tend to live in areas with concentrated poverty, surrounded by other poor families. Concentrated poverty for black Americans, wrought in large part by discrimination in the labor market, geographically concentrated public housing complexes and gentrification, means that they are often confronted with poorly performing schools, insufficient access to health care providers and food deserts. In this context, it\u2019s not surprising that black Americans experience high levels of food insecurity: More than one in five black households were food insecure in 2015, compared to one in eight of all American households. SNAP has been a critical factor in helping black families stave off food insecurity and poverty, helping to feed 13 million black families in a given month in 2015. More than 2 million black families, including 1.1 million children, used SNAP to stay on the other side of financial disaster in 2014. An additional 1.1 million black families were insulated from \u201cdeep poverty\u201d that year as well, thanks to SNAP. Black Americans comprised 21 percent of Medicaid enrollees in 2013 and are highly concentrated in five of the 11 states identified by the Kaiser Family Foundation as being the most vulnerable states to ensuing challenges from cuts to Medicaid. Those five states, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina, have the highest black populations in the country. Weakening Medicaid could mean a return to the days when more than 20 percent of black adults were uninsured and 30 percent reported not having a consistent source of health care. Even now, black Americans, with the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid and Medicare fully intact, are uninsured at higher rates than their white counterparts and are more likely to suffer dire health outcomes as a result: Maternal mortality rates for black women in some parts of the country rival those of women in sub-Saharan African. Perhaps nowhere is the existence of black poverty and the need for the social safety net more apparent than in Alabama, where the poverty rate is 18.5 percent. Concentrated poverty strongly correlates to black residence in the stretch of the state referred to as the \u201cBlack Belt,\u201d where black families are between three and four times as likely to live in poverty as white families. Alabama recently attained international attention in the wake of a special report from the United Nations, which gave the state the dubious distinction of being one of the most impoverished regions in the developed world. Lowndes County, a county in the Black Belt where 35 percent of black residents live in poverty as compared to only 4.1 percent of white residents, was singled out as an example of Alabama poverty at its most extreme. Dismantling the social safety net could mean the duplication of the conditions that plague Alabama\u2019s Black Belt throughout the country. If anything, congressional reform efforts to the social safety net should focus on making it more equitable, not less, with the Democratic Party leading the charge. As things currently stand, social safety net programs, as critical as they are to the financial stability of black families, can disadvantage black families in their own right. TANF, of which blacks represent 29.7 percent of total enrollees, has been shown to have its benefits distributed by the states in a discriminatory fashion, according to the Urban Institute. States with high numbers of black residents distribute fewer TANF dollars to families and for shorter amounts of time compared to states with whiter populations. Oregon, a state in which black Americans make up a mere 1.8 percent of the population, allows an eligible single-parent-led family of three $506 in TANF assistance per month. In Mississippi, where the population is 38 percent black, a similarly situated family is only eligible to receive $170 each month. Benefit generosity is based not only on the dollar amount offered, but on the number of impoverished families serviced. To this point, the Urban Institute found that states with high black representation were more limited in terms of how their social safety net services were distributed. Louisiana and Arkansas, where black Americans make up significant portions of the population, have some of the lowest TANF-to-poverty ratios in the nation, with TANF benefits being offered to four for every 100 in poverty and seven for every 100 in poverty, respectively. Over half of all black Americans live in the 25 states with the lowest TANF-to-poverty ratios, meaning that TANF\u2019s benefits disproportionately accrue to whites. Not only is the social safety net not as generous as it could or should be to recipients, it has gaping holes that have left or pushed many eligible Americans out into the cold. Data from 2014 shows that TANF covered 850,000 adults and their 2.5 million children, a fraction of those covered at its inception in 1996. Between 1996 and 2013, while poverty and deep poverty increased, TANF covered 60 percentfewer recipients. Stated differently, before the transition from the more generous Aid to Families with Dependent Children to TANF, which marked the \u201cend of welfare as we know it,\u201d seven in 10 poor families received cash assistance. Today, two in 10 do. Experts anticipate that the amount of money that goes directly to families will decline further in the years to come even without being hastened along by the Republicans in Congress. The black community is one of the Democratic Party\u2019s most reliable voting blocks. Using survey data collected from some 400 black interviewees, political scientist Theodore Johnson created a number of hypothetical political situations to assess black voting patterns. Party was an overwhelming factor in their political decision-making; faced with Republican and Democratic contenders with identical policy positions in identical social climates, the black respondents resoundingly chose the Democrat. Unfortunately, their loyalty has not always been repaid with proportionate policy responsiveness, most disappointingly from Democrats. Political scientist Nick Stephanopoulos conducted a study to determine the extent of group political power on effecting policy outcomes at the state and federal levels. Unsurprisingly, black voters had less power than whites: Unanimous support among whites for a federal policy corresponded to a 60 percent chance of adoption, while unanimous support among black Americans for such a policy corresponded to a 10 percent chance of adoption. Somewhat correspondingly then, Stephanopoulos found that the less support a policy had among black Americans, the higher its likelihood of enactment. A policy with no black support had a 40 percent chance of enactment compared to the aforementioned 10 percent for a policy with unanimous support. Analysis from the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies corroborated Stephanopoulos\u2019 2015 findings. With data collected between 1972 and 2010, researchers found that black voters were \u201cpolicy winners\u201d 31.9 percent of the time, while white voters were \u201cwinners\u201d 37.6 percent of the time. Less power means less policy. Political scientist Paul Frymer first articulated the underpinnings of these studies in his 1999 book, Uneasy Alliances: Race and Party Competition in America. He observed that politicians focus their appeals and energy toward white swing voters at the expense of black voters, thereby rendering them politically inert. The result of the need to entice white voters is that explicit argumentsfor racial reconciliation during presidential campaigns have been waning since the 1970s, lest they turn white voters off. In light of this history, it\u2019s difficult to know exactly to what extent the party will advocate for black voters. However, there are encouraging signs to be found. In 2016, the Democratic Party platform pledged \u201cto make it clear that black lives matter.\u201d The party promised to commit itself to addressing issues that more explicitly affect the black community, including the racial wealth gap, and that implicitly affect them, like attempts to cut funding from SNAP and Medicaid. They actionized those promises in December 2017: Not a single Democrat in the House or the Senate voted for the Republican tax plan, a massive payout to the top one percent that will widen the racial wealth gap. Progressives in the Democratic Party have every reason to buck their history of neglect, having seen what black voters can do electorally. In spite of a history of electoral disenfranchisement, electoral neglect, gerrymandering, and voting purges, black voters have potential to flip elections when they turn out at a time when Democrats desperately need them to. Furthermore, the party itself has explicitly acknowledged that it needs to do better. Mirroring Chairman Perez, Virgie Rollins, chair of the DNC\u2019s Black Caucus, insisted that the party apparatus is well aware of this: \u201cWe learned valuable lessons last month and last night; when we invest in our communities, we win. The DNC knows black voters are a force to be reckoned with at the ballot box.\u201d The midterm elections are nine months from now. Progressives in the Democratic Party must actively compete for black votes, running not only on an anti-Trump platform, but on one that offers tangible protections from Republican assaults and tangible solutions to the challenges the black community faces. Not only is advocating for black Americans the right thing for the Democratic Party to do morally, but it also makes sense politically. Loyalty from the black community cannot be taken for granted, especially at a moment when the stakes of doing the opposite are so high.

The Journal covers the story here, and here\u2019s the (literal) money quote: \u201c\u2018We will prioritize investing only in responsible platforms that are committed to creating a positive impact in society,\u2019 [Weed] will say, according to prepared remarks.\u201d Put another way: Clean up the fake news, the addictive manipulation, and the AI-driven kid bait, or we\u2019ll pull hundreds of millions of dollars from YouTube, Facebook, and Google. The result could be a major bonanza for huge publishers like Oath and Amazon, and perhaps for media outlets with less scale such as Vox, Axios, and Buzzfeed. Sounds like a big loss for the platforms, no? Well, maybe. I was on the board of the IAB for many years, I helped lead its fraud efforts, and I\u2019ve worked closely with huge advertisers like Unilever. And upon seeing this news, my only question is this: Will it even matter? Weed isn\u2019t the first major CMO to target Google and Facebook, in fact, his colleague Marc Pritchard, head of brand at P&G, did exactly the same thing, at exactly the same conference one year ago, calling on the duopoly to \u201cclean up the digital supply chain.\u201d Pritchard was focused mainly on fraud, bad actors and advertising \u2018viewability\u2019 (it\u2019s astounding how many ads are paid for, but still not seen by anyone), but his threat was very real: After reports of his ads being placed alongside unsavory content on YouTube, Pritchard pulled all his spend. Nearly one year later, it has yet to be reinstated. During that time, Google\u2019s revenues have increased by more than 20 percent, on a base of more than $27 billion per quarter. That\u2019s more than $100 billion a year. P&G\u2019s protest vote of an estimated $140 million represents roughly\u00a0.0014 percent of that revenue base. Sure, Google prefers to not lose a marquee client like P&G. But one has to ask\u200a\u2014\u200awhy has the company failed to woo the world\u2019s largest advertiser back to the fold? Might it be the math? For every $100 million a major advertiser like Unilever or P&G is willing to move off the platforms, there are another million advertisers eager to replace them with much smaller buys. This is the power of self service platforms. In March of 2016, Facebook announced it had 3 million advertisers. One year later, that number was 5 million. The vast majority of those were individuals and small businesses spending $20 or $30 a pop promoting pages they created themselves (you know, kind of like the Russians did). And as long as those small advertisers feel like they\u2019re getting what they paid for, the platforms can afford to grin f*ck the hell out of their largest customers. Major advertisers may not be able to throw their weight around like they used to, but they do have a shot at the moral high ground. The key to today\u2019s story is the qualifier: Weed is threatening to cut off all marketing spend on platforms which fail to \u201ccreate a positive impact in society.\u201d So who determines \u201cpositive impact\u201d? If there\u2019s one clear takeaway from the mess that the platforms have found themselves in since the election, it\u2019s this: Google and Facebook are genetically incapable of taking responsibility for the content on their platforms. Doing so would quite literally destroy the core of their business model as \u201cneutral tech platforms.\u201d As Sheryl Sandberg puts it: \u201cWe are not a media company.\u201d She may as well have added: \u201cAnd we don\u2019t intend to become one.\u201d This places the moral imperative of determining \u201cpositive impact\u201d squarely on the shoulders of the advertising industry. During the television era, advertisers were entirely comfortable determining the moral quality of the content adjacent to their messaging. Will things change if they accept the responsibility again in today\u2019s platform era? I certainly hope *that\u2019s* the focus of the IAB\u2019s work going forward. The world\u2019s largest advertisers are now willing to lead. Our industry should be helping them in every way possible. A few related stories broke over the weekend that are well worth your time. I\u2019m only a third of the way through this piece, which came out late last night, but it\u2019s excellent so far. A much needed history of how we got to where we are today. This guy isn\u2019t the hero this story makes him out to be (there were many, many others, far more studied, who have been saying the same thing for years, like Renee DiResta and Zeynep Tufecki), but the point is worth making in any case.

He traveled all over the world, had hordes of fans, and did something for a living that most people see as a hobby in their pastime. He boasts of being a former World \u21161 in tennis, an eight-time Grand Slam champion and an Olympic gold medalist. Formerly married to actress and model Brooke Shields, Agassi\u2019s life off court was as vibrant as his tennis performance. He would collaborate with brands such as Nike, Adidas, and American Express on multi-million dollar endorsement deals. Agassi was the ultimate sports star. So why was he unhappy? In his autobiography Open, Andre Agassi revealed that he hated tennis. He hated it with what he calls a \u201cdark and secret passion\u201d. At the age of three, Agassi began playing tennis under his father, who was a former Olympic boxer for Iran. When he showed aptitude for the game, his father deemed education unnecessary and even a hindrance to his tennis practice. At thirteen, he was enrolled in tennis camp, which felt to him more like a prison. As a youth, Agassi was pushed relentlessly by his father to practice for hours each day, hitting hundreds of balls in the court. As an adult, he pushed himself to the limits and past it, all the while battling with depression, drugs, and a tormented spirit. He hated it. And yet, he couldn\u2019t stop playing. Everyone, including himself, was counting on him to win. Considering the grueling practice sessions and the pressure to reach the top, it\u2019s no wonder why any enjoyment Agassi had for the game, if he ever did have it, was sucked out. He\u2019s not the only athlete who feels this way. Professional soccer player (i.e. footballer) Benoit Assou-Ekotto surprised many with his open admission that he played the sport for money, rather than for the love of it. He says, \u201cI don\u2019t say that I hate football but it\u2019s not my passion.\u201d Yet still, he shows up for practice every day and gives it his all. Conventional wisdom says that loving what we do is a prerequisite to making it our career. If we don\u2019t love our work, then we won\u2019t want to work at it. And if we don\u2019t work at it, then we won\u2019t be successful at what we do. So what\u2019s the point? Consider a different view. Just like how a love for what you do isn\u2019t necessary for success, having a passionate interest in something doesn\u2019t automatically translate into pursuing it as a career. You might love doing something as a hobby, but it doesn\u2019t mean you should earn a living through it. When you rely on your hobby to pay your wages, everything changes. Combining your career with an interest means that there\u2019s a lot more pressure to excel in your work. Your well-being becomes linked to what you do, which takes away the fun of experimenting around and working on your hobby whenever you feel like it. Now you have to do the work every day, rain or shine. When we think about what we want to do, we often simply consider purely what the job has to offer. We look at the salary, the type of work we\u2019ll be doing, and the amount of prestige and recognition that the position will give us. Or, we might simply follow the crowd and go wherever our friends are headed. But the most important consideration that we dismiss too easily is the lifestyle. How well does the career fit into the life we want? Does the career we pursue give us the financial means to be comfortable? How much time are we willing to spend on a daily basis on our work? Spending more on one aspect of our lives means cutting back on another. Benoit Assou-Ekotto decided to become a soccer player because he was afraid of working in an office making a modest salary. At 16, he was expelled from school because of his poor academics, which pushed him to soccer. Advancing in his career required him to relocate to a place where he didn\u2019t speak the language or know anyone. It has also meant dealing with the downsides of the sport, such as the media and shallow relationships. It\u2019s interesting how we love to look at the highs of a career, but rarely do we consider its lows. To reach success in a field, you strain yourself physically and mentally. To get recognition and admiration, you attract unwanted attention. The more you have of one thing, the more you get of its unwanted aspects as well. Are you willing to pay the price? What are you willing to give up in order to achieve something? Pursuing a passion isn\u2019t just about doing what you love every day. It becomes a matter of accepting what comes along with the work, and whether you\u2019re willing to make the sacrifices to take on those burdens. There is no right choice to make. Knowing what type of career you want and how it fits into your life is a personal choice that varies by person. Some of us are willing to pursue something we love, even if it means less time for loved ones and undergoing financial or emotional strain. Others place a priority on a comfortable and stable lifestyle, so we\u2019re willing to perform mundane tasks if it provides the means to what we want. Being passionate about something shouldn\u2019t be the sole requirement for choosing what you want to do. It\u2019s about accepting the benefits and trappings of your work before making a commitment.

The aliens of the Kurt Vonnegut universe, most notably appearing in Slaughterhouse-Five, find it quaint that humans can only see what\u2019s happening to them right now. Tralfalmadorians, instead, \u201ccan see where each star has been and where it is going, so that the heavens are filled with rarefied, luminous spaghetti.\u201d Humans are doomed to merely imagine the future, and to remember the past with increasing dimness and imprecision. For Tralfalmadorians, everything and everyone is doing everything they always will all at once. But knowledge is useless without the ability to act. When Billy Pilgrim asks why they don\u2019t prevent the end of the world, caused by a test pilot pressing a button, they say they simply cannot. \u201cHe has always pressed it, and he always will. We always let him and we always will let him. The moment is structured that way.\u201d On Earth, I am always quoting an article about health care in America. I am always calling someone \u201cretarded\u201d as a term of endearment. I am always telling people that I am safe and nowhere near Mumbai. I am always defending the concept of \u201cSteak and Blowjob\u201d day. I am always hugging a friend I see every day and never see anymore, bragging about stealing rum from a frat house, performatively announcing that I will be using Twitter to amplify other voices, telling someone I\u2019ve cut out of my life that I love them. Social media has not gotten us to the point where we can experience something like the future. But our pasts are always happening in real time, turning us into half-Tralfalmadorians. Anyone scrolling through my Facebook feed, which has existed since 2004, or who Googles enough to unearth my awful old blog, can see everything I\u2019ve posted\u200a\u2014\u200aevery misguided opinion, every drunk photo and inside joke\u200a\u2014\u200awith the clarity and presence of the moment I posted it. I am 17 and 24 and 31, forever. For Tralfalmadorians, the solution was to approach this information with a shrug: \u201cSo it goes.\u201d If everyone is always doing everything they always have, then there is no point in frustration. No one can change, because there is no such thing as change. And if everyone\u2019s pasts are always there to see, then it\u2019s not like anyone can lie. For humans it\u2019s not so simple. We are expected to grow and change, but we also remain bound to our online pasts. (We can edit our public records, sometimes\u200a\u2014\u200aI can\u2019t delete my old blog no matter how many times I email Blogger\u200a\u2014\u200abut other people can keep receipts.) Growth is hard when anyone we meet can see all the horrible things we\u2019ve ever said. It\u2019s especially hard when those horrible things might ambush us at any moment, attached to the message \u201cWe care about the memories you share.\u201d Our perceptions of each other are already warped by memory. Our parents cannot stop seeing us as children who need their help, even if we\u2019ve grown. My ex-boyfriend will never stop being the guy who called me a slut for having had sex once before I met him, even if (I hope) he treats his wife better than that. I\u2019m sure a friend has a postcard I sent her somewhere where I make jokes I\u2019d never make now. Still, it was easier to move from one moment to the next when time appeared linear, and the past could become past. The sting of most actions fade with time, especially when coupled with different, newer ones. But the internet amplifies our memories, and makes them something more than memories\u200a\u2014\u200asomething closer to the Tralfamadorian experience of all the past existing all the time. Instead of a distant recollection, we have proof\u200a\u2014\u200aour radiant young faces smiling back at us, reminding us exactly where we are, where we were, what we did. Anyone can visit any version of ourselves whenever they want, a permanent slideshow of how we haven\u2019t always been the person we\u2019ve tried to become. Editing only makes it worse. Prospective employers get creeped out if there\u2019s nothing about you online, and for a prospective date, this might make you seem like a serial killer. What\u2019s more, learning about someone\u2019s online past can be a form of affection. \u201cFailure to look someone up online seemed almost rude, a sign of disinterest,\u201d wrote Maureen O\u2019Connor for The Cut, after a date said he wasn\u2019t going to Google her until he got to know her in person. If there are things about each other for us to know, why wouldn\u2019t we want to know them? It would be easier to reckon with our pasts if everyone else did too. But all our posts and pictures don\u2019t come with addendums, letting anyone looking know what our current selves regret. While Tralfalmadorians see the actions and movements between each version of ourselves, we get only a scatter graph. I am not the spaghetti of choices I\u2019ve made between 2009 and 2018. I am only both then and now, no matter how conflicting they are. It doesn\u2019t matter if I would never again say what I said. I said it. I\u2019m always saying it. The problem is we\u2019re too Tralfalmadorian and not Tralfalmadorian enough. We do not have a grasp of the future enough to throw up our green hand with an eye in its palm and say \u201cSo it goes,\u201d nor can we be blissfully unaware of anything happening outside our own present. And even when looking into the past, we see our shifts and changes in ungraceful chunks instead of the luminous spaghetti of the stars. When Billy Pilgrim asks how Tralfalmadorians handle seeing every bad thing anyone has ever done, every war, every selfish decision, all the time, they say they just try to focus on the good things: cherry pick what they want to see and ignore what they don\u2019t, since it\u2019s all happening anyway. It feels irresponsible to do that as a human\u200a\u2014\u200aakin to the \u201cbut he\u2019s always been nice to me\u201d method of excusing an abuser. We\u2019re not fantastical aliens out of books. We need to find a way to reckon with everything about who we are. But if we\u2019re going to learn something about memory and time and history from these fantastical aliens out of books, maybe we can learn it from the way Tralfamadorians read. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any particular relationship between all the messages\u201d in a book, one of them tells Billy, \u201cexcept that the author has chosen them carefully, so that, when seen all at once, they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep. There is no beginning, no middle, no end, no suspense, no moral, no causes, no effects. What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time.\u201d When Tralfamadorians read, they don\u2019t see the plot or even the characters. What they see is the curation, the human touch. It\u2019s the very humanity of this craft, the way a story reflects its author and her choices, that makes a book beautiful. If Tralfalmadorians can ignore the long noodle of time to focus on a collection of marvelous moments, then maybe we can do the opposite. We can remember that between one post a decade ago and now, there were endless versions of ourselves and others, changing and choosing. And that we will continue to do so in ways we can\u2019t see until we look back. We can look at the Facebook scatter graph and calculate our full trajectory, so that those different points become one experience.

The team, who does not work in any framework, is supposed to deliver their goal at the end of the week, so, before they start creating all the tasks needed, we first could visualize which is their plan in terms of what they think they will be doing each day of the week. The reason for doing this is because if the team needs to think on what they will be doing, they will internally plan the week so therefore the team together will be aligning on the steps they need to follow to achieve the goal, which in consequence should reduce the uncertainty. The team, who have been working together for a long time they are going to be starting a new \u201cproject\u201d which is to experience during one month with a new technology that could improve the performance of the product. Again, before they start creating all the tasks needed, we first could visualize which is their plan in terms of what they think they will be doing each day of the week. The team in the past maybe was working with Scrum, or maybe Kanban, or maybe nothing, but the thing here is that they are going to be working in a phase where the trial & error will be very present and there isn\u2019t going to be an official release of a product for a customer. Each square represents one day of the week, the teams need to define together what they think they will be working on each day of the week, this is not a commitment, this is just the direction they would like to follow in order to achieve their weekly goals: You can call Stand Up or something else, but as we would do in Scrum, the team every morning take some time and do a health check of the weekly goal, we don\u2019t want to report here, we just to make sure that the team is still aligned with the initial weekly goal and they still believe is achievable. Let\u2019s now imagine that we are on Wednesday, we are having the Stand Up and the team is still struggling with what they thought they would be doing on Monday, is this a problem? I don\u2019t think so! As soon as we can catch this then the better, this will be a good opportunity to really get the team together helping each other to fix whatever issues they have in order to continue working towards the weekly goal. I don\u2019t think we should modify the initial goal, setting realistic expectations is always a hard thing to do, we always can miss information that can affect our plans, so achieving the weekly goal will be something difficult and probably even more at the beginning, we just need to continue working in order to try to achieve the weekly goal. This does not work, when I said before \u201cneed to continue working in order to try to achieve the weekly goal\u201d of course implies to stick to our principles and values, we can not sacrifice quality for instance only because we want to achieve the goal, that is not the point, so our principles and values about how we do the things should remain intact even if we see that is not going to be possible to achieve the weekly goal. Don\u2019t get it that way, we all have expectations and wishes, if we are not able to do what we thought we would do we just need to learn from it and try to avoid the same mistakes happening again. This is great and we should celebrate it, take some time and celebrate together that the team was able to achieve what they wanted, it\u2019s such a good feeling when you succeed with your plans, so it deserves a big celebration. As we would do again in Scrum, we will get together and retrospect about the week, how it went, which problems we had and how we could prevent them from happening again, also very important how we can improve what we did well during the week. It might happen that there are teams who are not willing to start with Scrum or a different framework, and this is fine you don\u2019t have to create a fight, however, somehow you need to define expectations of work and be transparent with the progress. This weekly goal is full of common sense, and for a team that wants to achieve their goals independently of if they have been working for a long time or not, is going to be very hard to disagree with this idea.

The body size is about the same as the iPhone 8, however the 5.8-inch OLED screen is larger than the iPhone 8 Plus\u2019s 5.5-inch screen. Lets take a look at what is new and the things to keep in mind when we approach designing for the iPhone X. The taller form factor, an extra 145 pt allows for additional content rows or a menu that, on previous standard iPhones, would have been too cramped. The screen size difference between the original iPhone and the iPhone X is a massive 332 pt in height. This enables the content to take up majority of the screen space while still allowing for critical action and navigation components like nav bar, tab bar, tool bar and the home indicator to have their own space. There is no longer a battle for space between the content and the navigation components, which allows the user experience to be even better while conforming to Apple\u2019s Human Interface Design Guidelines Lets talk about the notch. Probably the most controversial aspect of the iPhone X, some people like it and some people hate it. The notch houses sensors for FaceID, the camera and the speaker. The notch is the only element that prevents the iPhone X from truly being an edge to edge screen. After having comprehensively used the iPhone X it seems the notch still provides valuable space for the status bar and extra app content. Apple advises that designers and developers would do well to embrace the notch by ignoring it and to not hide it with a black bar or by introducing gesture controlled elements that morph the notch. By hiding the notch your app can feel smaller than the apps an iPhone X user is accustomed to, as explained in this video iOS 11 introduces a feature that was initially seen in the Apple music app, which is titles that are sized at 34 pt and set at Semibold in black. This is now a standard alternative ( you can still choose to have the traditional screen title in the nav bar) in iOS 11. The interesting behaviour here is that when a user scrolls the title animates to the centre of the nav bar while shrinking to 18pt set at Medium. This behaviour ensures that the big screen title does not take up space from the content itself giving back that valuable space when the user scrolls. The status bar now includes multiple gestures and a height increase. The height has more than doubled from 20 pt to 44 pt. When swiping down from top left the Notifications can be viewed. When swiping down from the top right the user can view the Control Centre. The home button has been done away with on the iPhone X, instead we have an on screen interactive element. Swiping from the bottom up takes the user to the home screen, if done quickly. To access the screens navigator the user needs to interrupt the swipe up. Being edge to edge (relatively) the iPhone X screen introduces curved edges and the earlier mentioned notch. Apple has introduced safe area guides to ensure that the content doesn\u2019t get clipped by either of the two new elements. The safe are layout guide helps designers and developers visualise the area where their content should be ideally placed to avoid content clipping. Backgrounds are expected to NOT follow the safe area guide to utilise the edge to edge screen design, however content such as text, images, video and buttons should follow these guides. Usually you may not place elements in the corners of the screen, however when your app engages the Camera the status bar is removed and the interface is edge to edge. On such app screens it is important to ensure there is enough margin in the corners to ensure that the content does not clip and does not hug the curved corners. A corner radius of 16 pt is recommended for views that are placed near any of the four rounded corners of the iPhone X. While initially fun and fresh, the hamburger menu is a usability nightmare as it demands more taps from the user to access features and screens. This is an example of a context where data encapsulation does more harm than good. When the screen is bigger the users suffer even more in terms of one hand usage. The user is unable to reach all the way across to tap the Hamburger menubutton without doing a weird in-hand shuffle. The Hamburger Menu is the reason why Mobile-Web experience has remained stagnant and inferior to native app experience. With the longer iPhone X screen the tab bar is the obvious choice to replace the Hamburger menu, it takes up little space and ensures that other screens are accessible to the user immediately and are always under visible attention. If your app has more 3 to 5 primary sections you should be using a Tab Bar. A continuing series on how to design for the iPhone X.

When recalling memories, we generally focus on 3 key components of moments: It\u2019s not surprising that these are the memories that stick out the most. What is surprising, according to Chip and Dan Heath, is that very few people INVEST in such moments. Most people reactively let the most powerful experiences happen. Few people continuously create those experiences. The average person experiences almost all of their \u201cpeak\u201d experiences in their teens and 20\u2019s. These experiences taper-off in most people\u2019s 30\u2019s and are basically non-existent as a person gets older and older. According to Dr. Abraham Maslow, peak experiences are necessary to becoming self-actualized\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is where you\u2019ve fully developed as a person and can pursue your highest potential. Most people plateau at a certain stage of their development. They stop dealing with the highs, lows, and transitions of growth. Instead, they seek the safety of stability. This safety shields them from the risks, pain, and seeking that is required for growth. Growth isn\u2019t supposed to feel good in the moment. Confidence and dopamine are not the same thing. In today\u2019s fast-paced and every-changing environment, the norm for most people is to seek short-term dopamine highs, followed by long-term internal conflict and regret. The reverse of this pattern is to seek confidence, which is the product of consistent and congruent decisions. The common notion that confidence leads to success is flat wrong. It\u2019s successful behavior that creates confidence. You cannot have confidence without positive behaviors. If you took a minute to examine your recent past, when is the last \u201cpeak\u201d experience you can recall? When is the last powerful \u201cmoment\u201d that shifted how you saw the world? When was the last time you attempted something you\u2019ve never done before? When was the last time you put everything on the line for your convictions? When was the last time you made a real decision? Said Tony Robbins, \u201cA real decision is measured by the fact that you\u2019ve taken a new action. If there\u2019s no action, you haven\u2019t truly decided.\u201d Life-changing moments are inherently emotional. If you\u2019re not willing to deal with powerful (and sometimes difficult) emotions, then you\u2019ve frozen yourself in time. You\u2019ve settled for what you currently have. You\u2019ve shifted from seeking and approaching life to shielding and avoiding life. When you freeze yourself in time, you stop putting yourself in demanding situations that require you to rise up to a new level. You stop taking on roles you\u2019ve never played before\u200a\u2014\u200aand you settle for the environment and relational expectations that make up your current reality. You stop being willing to fail. You stop trying new things. You stop dreaming. You stop exercising faith. So how do you engineer more of these \u201cmoments\u201d into your life? From 2010 to 2014, I wanted to be a writer. But I never wrote. Two very important things happened that finally got me to commit to the dream I had lying dormant within me. That investment created a far deeper sense of commitment within me. Had I not made that investment, my commitment would have shrunk, not increased. I made two other important investments, which have now become \u201cpeak memories.\u201d They are moments that stick deeply in my memory. They altered the trajectory of my life. They enhanced my commitment to my dreams. They upgraded my subconscious belief system about what I could do with my life. I bought a $197 online course which taught me how to write viral headlines and pitch articles to big platforms. Then, I bought 20 copies of THE ART OF WORK in order to have a 30 minute conversation with Jeff Goins, a writer I aspired to be like. He was doing a promotion trying to sell more copies. This investment was a little bit of a mental stretch at the time. Paying around $250 to have a 30 minute phone call seemed a little crazy. But that phone call opened up lots of mental doors for me. It helped me get information directly from the source\u200a\u2014\u200awhich can be more powerful that reading books or taking online courses. Actually hearing the person talk to you. And acknowledge YOU. And for them to answer your questions directly is very powerful. Even if the answers they give you aren\u2019t profound. It\u2019s the fact that you\u2019re WATCHING YOURSELF move in the direction of your dreams. Those are powerful decisions, with huge consequence. Your decisions determine your destiny. Your decisions determine your confidence, or lack thereof. Your decisions determine your identity\u200a\u2014\u200awho you become is the product of your consistent choice. Your personality isn\u2019t a fixed and unchanging thing. That\u2019s a myth of Western culture. Your personality is multi-faceted. We all have multiple personalities. And our personalities should never stop developing and changing. Most people FREEZE in their development because they stop INVESTING in life-altering \u201cMOMENTS.\u201d They stop engineering peaks, pits, and transitions. They stop making powerful decisions. They stop creating conditions that force them to adapt in new and more powerful ways. They stop taking on greater responsibility\u200a\u2014\u200aand thus, are left with limited power. Very few people make truly committed decisions. Very few people invest in life-altering moments. Most people have frozen and fixed personalities\u200a\u2014\u200awhich remain locked-in-place because their environment supports their limiting beliefs and suppressed emotions. If you want to make big decisions, you need to put yourself into a powerful state of mind. You need to put yourself into an emotional place, where you\u2019re connected with your core values and beliefs. Where you\u2019re really feeling alive. I don\u2019t have a specific prescription for how to do that. However, a few key components of getting into such a state of mind are: You can and will change if you INVEST in peak experiences, and if you consistently act in desired ways. Confidence is a byproduct. Personality is a byproduct. Your behavior and decisions determine these things. Decisions determine destiny. I\u2019ve created a cheat sheet for putting yourself into a peak state, immediately. If you follow this daily, everything will change for you. Get the cheat sheet here!

We have so many books of design and so many free sources to get inspired and when it comes to real life product such as iTunes or Googles tries and failures of their so called social media are just terrible. And even though they have all the data they still don\u2019t understand people. Why do bad products exist when we actually know how to make good ones?Why are there some good products and some bad products? This is because we live in two worlds. The one is with our assumptions and the other one is the real world. The two worlds are connected by our wishes. What if we transform that wish into actual knowledge? Wouldn\u2019t that be a better bridge to the real world? When we talk about user experience and design we all understand user research, usability and so on which is in fact only one part of it. You also have to know about all the things that you don\u2019t control. Even when talking to your colleges, don\u2019t take everything for granted, or shut your ears and pretend listening. Be there; try to find out what he wants to say, why is he saying it that way. If you agree or disagree with somebody don\u2019t just nod your head. Usually they say you have to learn to listen, but you actually have to learn to be the last to speak. As Simon Sinek says: Simply sit and ask questions. Understand what they mean. Why they have the opinion that they have. Don\u2019t get enough with just what they say. And in the end you will get your turn. It sounds easy but it\u2019s not. Just practice to be the last to speak. You have to know all the things that you don\u2019t control like people and situations. If you do than at least you\u2019re informed and you can prepare yourself. So what is really a research? Is it the thing that can help you finding the things you can control? Actually it\u2019s just asking questions and being organized while queuing the answers. All the research is done to have the necessary information to make decisions. A design project is a series of decisions. Only data doesn\u2019t change minds, big companies have to understand that. So the general corporate thinking is like this \u201cYou know we don\u2019t have time to do a research but we have time to figure out if it\u2019s the right thing \u201c! Making statements instead of asking questions it\u2019s a hasty action. Maybe some companies can allow this to themselves but it\u2019s a waste! Even the garbage has to be organized in order to live in a better world. Anyhow to do a basic research we require only to\u00a0: 1. Ask question 2. Gather Data 3. Analyze the Data. That\u2019s it. I know that you have to show numbers and reports. But most of the people don\u2019t read them. They see the results and you get asked stupid questions without any rooted case or argument. Very few ask questions like, \u201cWhat questions did you ask to do the research?\u201d. That is actually very important because is the questions that determine the results.

The aliens of the Kurt Vonnegut universe, most notably appearing in Slaughterhouse-Five, find it quaint that humans can only see what\u2019s happening to them right now. Tralfalmadorians, instead, \u201ccan see where each star has been and where it is going, so that the heavens are filled with rarefied, luminous spaghetti.\u201d Humans are doomed to merely imagine the future, and to remember the past with increasing dimness and imprecision. For Tralfalmadorians, everything and everyone is doing everything they always will all at once. But knowledge is useless without the ability to act. When Billy Pilgrim asks why they don\u2019t prevent the end of the world, caused by a test pilot pressing a button, they say they simply cannot. \u201cHe has always pressed it, and he always will. We always let him and we always will let him. The moment is structured that way.\u201d On Earth, I am always quoting an article about health care in America. I am always calling someone \u201cretarded\u201d as a term of endearment. I am always telling people that I am safe and nowhere near Mumbai. I am always defending the concept of \u201cSteak and Blowjob\u201d day. I am always hugging a friend I see every day and never see anymore, bragging about stealing rum from a frat house, performatively announcing that I will be using Twitter to amplify other voices, telling someone I\u2019ve cut out of my life that I love them. Social media has not gotten us to the point where we can experience something like the future. But our pasts are always happening in real time, turning us into half-Tralfalmadorians. Anyone scrolling through my Facebook feed, which has existed since 2004, or who Googles enough to unearth my awful old blog, can see everything I\u2019ve posted\u200a\u2014\u200aevery misguided opinion, every drunk photo and inside joke\u200a\u2014\u200awith the clarity and presence of the moment I posted it. I am 17 and 24 and 31, forever. For Tralfalmadorians, the solution was to approach this information with a shrug: \u201cSo it goes.\u201d If everyone is always doing everything they always have, then there is no point in frustration. No one can change, because there is no such thing as change. And if everyone\u2019s pasts are always there to see, then it\u2019s not like anyone can lie. For humans it\u2019s not so simple. We are expected to grow and change, but we also remain bound to our online pasts. (We can edit our public records, sometimes\u200a\u2014\u200aI can\u2019t delete my old blog no matter how many times I email Blogger\u200a\u2014\u200abut other people can keep receipts.) Growth is hard when anyone we meet can see all the horrible things we\u2019ve ever said. It\u2019s especially hard when those horrible things might ambush us at any moment, attached to the message \u201cWe care about the memories you share.\u201d Our perceptions of each other are already warped by memory. Our parents cannot stop seeing us as children who need their help, even if we\u2019ve grown. My ex-boyfriend will never stop being the guy who called me a slut for having had sex once before I met him, even if (I hope) he treats his wife better than that. I\u2019m sure a friend has a postcard I sent her somewhere where I make jokes I\u2019d never make now. Still, it was easier to move from one moment to the next when time appeared linear, and the past could become past. The sting of most actions fade with time, especially when coupled with different, newer ones. But the internet amplifies our memories, and makes them something more than memories\u200a\u2014\u200asomething closer to the Tralfamadorian experience of all the past existing all the time. Instead of a distant recollection, we have proof\u200a\u2014\u200aour radiant young faces smiling back at us, reminding us exactly where we are, where we were, what we did. Anyone can visit any version of ourselves whenever they want, a permanent slideshow of how we haven\u2019t always been the person we\u2019ve tried to become. Editing only makes it worse. Prospective employers get creeped out if there\u2019s nothing about you online, and for a prospective date, this might make you seem like a serial killer. What\u2019s more, learning about someone\u2019s online past can be a form of affection. \u201cFailure to look someone up online seemed almost rude, a sign of disinterest,\u201d wrote Maureen O\u2019Connor for The Cut, after a date said he wasn\u2019t going to Google her until he got to know her in person. If there are things about each other for us to know, why wouldn\u2019t we want to know them? It would be easier to reckon with our pasts if everyone else did too. But all our posts and pictures don\u2019t come with addendums, letting anyone looking know what our current selves regret. While Tralfalmadorians see the actions and movements between each version of ourselves, we get only a scatter graph. I am not the spaghetti of choices I\u2019ve made between 2009 and 2018. I am only both then and now, no matter how conflicting they are. It doesn\u2019t matter if I would never again say what I said. I said it. I\u2019m always saying it. The problem is we\u2019re too Tralfalmadorian and not Tralfalmadorian enough. We do not have a grasp of the future enough to throw up our green hand with an eye in its palm and say \u201cSo it goes,\u201d nor can we be blissfully unaware of anything happening outside our own present. And even when looking into the past, we see our shifts and changes in ungraceful chunks instead of the luminous spaghetti of the stars. When Billy Pilgrim asks how Tralfalmadorians handle seeing every bad thing anyone has ever done, every war, every selfish decision, all the time, they say they just try to focus on the good things: cherry pick what they want to see and ignore what they don\u2019t, since it\u2019s all happening anyway. It feels irresponsible to do that as a human\u200a\u2014\u200aakin to the \u201cbut he\u2019s always been nice to me\u201d method of excusing an abuser. We\u2019re not fantastical aliens out of books. We need to find a way to reckon with everything about who we are. But if we\u2019re going to learn something about memory and time and history from these fantastical aliens out of books, maybe we can learn it from the way Tralfamadorians read. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any particular relationship between all the messages\u201d in a book, one of them tells Billy, \u201cexcept that the author has chosen them carefully, so that, when seen all at once, they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep. There is no beginning, no middle, no end, no suspense, no moral, no causes, no effects. What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time.\u201d When Tralfamadorians read, they don\u2019t see the plot or even the characters. What they see is the curation, the human touch. It\u2019s the very humanity of this craft, the way a story reflects its author and her choices, that makes a book beautiful. If Tralfalmadorians can ignore the long noodle of time to focus on a collection of marvelous moments, then maybe we can do the opposite. We can remember that between one post a decade ago and now, there were endless versions of ourselves and others, changing and choosing. And that we will continue to do so in ways we can\u2019t see until we look back. We can look at the Facebook scatter graph and calculate our full trajectory, so that those different points become one experience.

What does it mean? Maybe you\u2019ll reply with something like: \u201cnew stuff!!\u201d, and if I press you, \u201cthat makes people\u2019s lives better!\u201d Ah, there\u2019s the rub, isn\u2019t it? So. Here\u2019s a tiny question: why isn\u2019t innovation doing precisely that? The last wave of innovation, apps, is used most intensively in the US (by a long way). But that is also precisely where living standards are cratering fastest and hardest. Life expectancy has fallen two years (in two years), infant and maternal mortality are rising, there are regular mass school shootings, the average American has less then $1k in savings, his real income is shrinking. The inescapable conclusion is: innovation isn\u2019t working. Not anymore, not the way it used to\u200a\u2014\u200aif it ever did. The most it can be doing today given the logic above is either mitigating the cataclysmic fall in living standards\u200a\u2014\u200aor fuelling it. Now, that will rankle some of you. You will look for ways out of this logic, but there are none\u200a\u2014\u200aperhaps you are wedded to this notion of innovation. Maybe it even defines your sense of self, so you will defend it with all your might. Worry not: I\u2019m here to defend innovation, not to bury it. But to do that, we must be clear-headed about its failings, mustn\u2019t we? Or else people are going to revolt against it, in just the same way they have revolted against other things that have failed to improve their lives recently: democracy, globalization, capitalism. So: innovation. Fuelling or mitigating falling living standards? Which is it\u200a\u2014\u200aand what we can do to fix this failure? If we think carefully about this last wave of innovation, what has it been, really? It\u2019s been the application of markets into everyday household life. Uber, TaskRabbit, Spotify, Amazon, and so on are, underneath the code and glitz, really just markets. So are Facebook and Twitter, in a different way\u200a\u2014\u200amarkets for information to target ads. Maybe that description feels unfamiliar\u200a\u2014\u200abecause we\u2019re used to \u201cmarkets\u201d being financial. But these are markets, too\u200a\u2014\u200afor taxis, songs, household help, ads, personal data, basic consumer goods, and so on. The last wave of innovation was about what I\u2019ll call \u201calgorithmic markets\u201d \u2014that is, algorithms that make anonymous market exchanges of even tiny everyday human interactions\u200a\u2014\u200aand in a way, you can see this wave as one giant algorithmic market, that is slowly rolling over families, communities, towns, schools, government, civic institutions, and a social contract, like a tsunami. Now. What do markets do? Well, they make things more efficient. So the upsides of these markets is straightforward: they create accessibility, convenience, ease, simplicity, by reducing barriers. As long as you have the money, you can trade. But that is not all markets do. Markets also have three often explosive downsides. They blow apart trust. They amplify inequality, creating sets of losers, who are treated mercilessly. And they shift costs and risks to the most powerless. That is precisely why, today, societies are reacting so strongly against globalization\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201ctrade deals\u201d made losers of once-prosperous middle classes, failed to support them, blew apart communities, and shifted costs and risks to average workers. Now here\u2019s the interesting part, at least to me. Those incendiary failings of globalization are exactly what app markets have wrought, too. That\u2019s not a coincidence\u200a\u2014\u200aboth are markets, ignoring their very real downsides. Let\u2019s consider Uber, the canonical example. It\u2019s reduced trust overall in society\u200a\u2014\u200alowering the bar for decent behaviour by CEOs and corporations, constantly skirting and attacking norms and laws. Risk and costs are shifted to drivers, and then back onto society\u200a\u2014\u200aof things like insurance, healthcare, safety regulations, and so on. They have no support whatsoever, having become something like captured not-quite-employees, but not-really-entrepreneurs either, because Uber is a monopsony. And it has in this way created sets of winners and losers, too\u200a\u2014\u200amanagment and shareholders have gotten super-rich, but the average driver has shared less than nothing in those gains\u200a\u2014\u200ahis real income, like that of the average American, is shrinking\u200a\u2014\u200aand so economic inequality has been reinforced. See the point yet? Algorithmic markets probably aren\u2019t mitigating falling living standards\u200a\u2014\u200athey are more likely fuelling them. They are creating something like a new caste society, of owners of digital capital, and alienated techno-serfs, whose only real job left in life is to obey the algorithm faster and harder than the next techno-serf. That is the basic logic of Amazon warehouses, Uber, Taskrabbit, etcetera. It is a dismal one, which none of us should really call \u201cinnovation\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200abecause it is hardly something new to go back to Dickensian age, only by way of a computer program. The market algorithm that is coming to dominate life in America\u200a\u2014\u200awhether Uber\u2019s, Amazon\u2019s, or Facebook\u2019s\u200a\u2014\u200ais not optimized for a higher quality of life. It is only optimized for speed, scale, and profit\u200a\u2014\u200aand damn the costs, whether they are human, social, cultural, environmental, or political. Let the weakest and most powerless pay them. So while of course there are \u201cupsides\u201d and \u201cdownsides\u201d to every economic exchange, the question isn\u2019t even whether they \u201cupsides\u201d outweigh the \u201cdownsides\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200abut whether they are considered in any real way at all. And the problem in this economy is that the algorithms that run it, just like the trade deals of global trade, reduce human beings to atomized, alienated, dehumanized, powerless commodities. For innovation to work\u200a\u2014\u200aeven you have admitted, thus far, that it\u2019s about \u201cmaking lives better\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athen that very idea must be put first. Making people\u2019s lives better means, at minimum, solving the problems that affect them, doesn\u2019t it? But the last wave of innovation didn\u2019t solve any of today\u2019s great global problems: inequality, stagnation, shrinking middle classes, climate change, extremism, authoritarianism, loneliness, distrust. In fact, by fuelling the great economic and social problems, it is probably exacerbating the political ones: democratic decline, people turning to strongmen, as their lives somehow get worse and worse. Now. How are we to failing innovation? Well, there are two ways, to my mind. First, to reinvent what innovators do. Go beyond profit and earnings and whatnot, and put well-being first. Create, design, develop, and deliver it\u200a\u2014\u200ajust like we do with material stuff. To do it, we\u2019ll also have to create whole new roles, departments, functions\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cChief Well-Being Officer\u201d, \u201cHuman Impact Designer\u201d, \u201cEudaimonia Engineer\u201d, and so on. Investors are already beginning to measure how well companies do all this. The second way, to me, is more interesting still. To reinvent what innovation is. This wave of innovation was about markets. Here\u2019s the ugly truth: society doesn\u2019t need more markets. It needs very different kinds of organizations: systems. Healthcare systems, financial systems, education systems\u200a\u2014\u200athat deliver not just efficiency, but creativity, trust, sanity, trust, opportunity, imagination, health, beauty, purpose. So the next wave of innovation won\u2019t be about algorithmic markets\u200a\u2014\u200ait will be about human systems, that deliver people the basics of decent human lives again. In an age of falling life expectancy, you\u2019re kidding yourself if you think otherwise. To create transformatively better lives, such systems are going to be made of coalitions and networks, of businesses, of banks, of communities, of cities and towns, of civic organizations\u200a\u2014\u200athey are going to blend and combine cooperation in radical and transformative ways, not just turn competition from gentle rivalry into bloodsport, which is what algorithmic markets do. The next wave of innovation can\u2019t fail us. We mustn\u2019t reduce something so crucial to human possibility as innovation to algorithmic markets shouting at us every few minutes to be a little more brutal, cruel, and blind. If innovation is only that, then how is the vicious cycle above\u200a\u2014\u200afalling living standards turning people away from democracy, capitalism, and trade, and into the arms of strongmen\u200a\u2014\u200ato be broken? But if it\u2019s not broken, innovators will go down right along with the societies and people they\u2019ve failed. So innovation must begin genuinely improving lives again\u200a\u2014\u200anot just pretending it does, and pocketing with one hand what it has hoodwinked with the other. This was a lost decade for innovation. Let\u2019s hope that we don\u2019t have another one. UmairFebruary 2018 By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out. vampire.

They beg us to subscribe, plaster ads all over their content, and dress up other ads as content. They prey on our anger, sell our data, track our movements, and hire consultants to think up other desperate ways to monetize their increasingly risk-averse offerings. All this and they still struggle to make a profit. They have been in denial about something for over a decade, something they will soon have no choice but to admit. The ad-based model inherent to the current internet simply cannot support quality writing. The ad-based model was a central fixture of Web 2.0, implemented by establishment publishers (publishing houses like Penguin and media companies like Vice) who never figured out a reliable way to charge a fair price for good written content online. Vandal Press is a new kind of publishing house built on Web 3 technologies. We distribute our writers\u2019 work solely through decentralized and/or distributed platforms that allow for peer-to-peer micropayments directly between writers and readers. We are not a tech company; the platforms have already been built. We are a publishing house for the blockchain age, one that utilizes the most cutting edge distribution technology in existence. The Church used the printing press. Penguin used bookstores, then Amazon. Vice used Facebook and Twitter. Vandal uses Steemit, Medium, and Patreon. Unlike the publishing dinosaurs, we do not sell advertisements. We therefore do not split ad revenues 90/10 in our favor (us/writer) in order to pay an obsolete staff. We foster direct micro-purchasing relationships between content creators and content consumers, in the range of cents per engagement (engagements are clicks, views, likes, reads, shares, upvotes, etc). We take 10% for curation, distribution, and editorial. The days of inefficient middlemen pressing writers to the margins while slurping up 90% of revenues have come to an end. Vandal Press writers take the largest piece of the pie. Our goal is to cut out barriers between writers and their audiences. Most of those barriers are people, members of outdated media and literary establishments that arose in a time when it made sense to give writers only 5\u201310% of the revenue generated by their work, simply because production and distribution costs were so high. The internet has, however, almost entirely eliminated those costs, while the outdated establishments remain. Writers should be free to monetize their work at will. The platforms they use to share their work\u200a\u2014\u200aoften for free\u200a\u2014\u200areceive small amounts per engagement by advertisers, so why shouldn\u2019t writers? Those who routinely generate thousands of engagements per article should be micro-paid for each of those engagements. Authors of popular digital books should be paid far more than 10% for each book (the standard publishing contract), because there are virtually no printing costs involved. Creators of popular articles should get a micropayment per click or share, or have the option to be tipped a cent or two by every reader. If writers can be paid directly by the consumers of their content, they should be paid directly by the consumers of their content. Of course, writers will have a harder time getting the same number of engagements as a publishing house/media company, because they won\u2019t have a constant stream of diverse content drawing people in. That\u2019s where Vandal Press comes in. Existing publishing gatekeepers have proven themselves incompetent. Ask a stranger on the street, for example, to name a great living writer outside of J.K. Rowling or Stephen King and see what happens. They are wasteful, exploitative, and unable to properly build and monetize audiences in a way that works for anyone besides the top\u00a0.0001% of writers. The writing economy is even worse than the global economy when it comes to income distribution\u2014there is no writing middle class. A small handful are extremely rich, while the rest don\u2019t even approach making a real living. Because of this, fresh, experimental, truly anti-establishment writing is increasingly rare. The distributed web is about to change that. New Web 3 platforms have opened the door to per-engagement micropayments other peer-to-peer, a la carte transactions between writers and their readers. These include centralized platforms like Medium, Patreon, Kindle Direct Publishing, GAB, and Kickstarter\u2019s Drip, as well as decentralized, blockchain-based platforms like Steemit, Brave, Tron, and OpenBazaar. Even financial products like Venmo and low-transaction-fee cryptocurrencies can be used to foster p2p payments between writers and readers. These new fat protocols are automating virtually all of the services once provided by publishing houses and media companies. CASE EXAMPLE OF OLD WEB 2.0 PUBLISHING Most media companies offer \u201cexposure\u201d to vast numbers of subscribers as justification for their low or non-existent writers\u2019 fees. Indeed, LA Weekly has nearly 800k Twitter followers, and if you write for them, they will share your work with that audience. LA Weekly also has many employees that need to be paid, and paid first, after the engagements generated by your work are sold to advertisers. The small fee a writer receives after LA Weekly\u2019s staff of editors, marketers, and middle managers is paid results in a matter of fractions of cents per engagement. LA Weekly considers a piece successful if it gets around 10,000 clicks. The average starting fee for an LA Weekly writer is $50 a piece. That adds up to half a cent per click for a good piece. That doesn\u2019t take into account all the engagements (clicks, likes, comments, shares, etc) that the article causes on social media, which are also packaged up and sold to advertisers by social media companies themselves. TL;DR There are a lot of people making money off of the engagements caused by a writer\u2019s work, the least of whom being the writer himself. CASE EXAMPLE OF NEW WEB 3 PUBLISHING Let\u2019s take a real life writer who has a small following of about 25,000 on Twitter. On Steemit, she monetizes her articles via their micropayments system, where users effectively \u201ctip\u201d their favorite writers a matter of cents per \u201cupvote.\u201d Her articles there routinely make $100\u2013200 from around 100 \u201cupvotes,\u201d and she posts them nearly every day. She also uses Patreon, where her most avid fans (say about 10\u201320% of her followers) pay her $1\u20134 per month, resulting in an additional $3,000/month. Thus, utilizing only two Web 3 platforms, and without any editorial or marketing staff, she is making much more than an LA Weekly freelancer could ever dream of making. And she\u2019s doing it with complete independence from both advertisers and corporate publishers. Now imagine if she distributed across all Web 3 platforms. What if her work could be cross-pollinated by other similar independent writers on a single publisher\u2019s page? \u201cExposure,\u201d except monetized? This is what Vandal Press does. Vandal Press is a skinny layer between writer and reader that provides the curation, editorial, marketing, and clerical work that writers don\u2019t have time to do. We choose our writers carefully, then distribute their work across all Web 3 platforms that allow them to be paid on a peer-to-peer basis, maximizing their exposure and building their paying audiences. A small monetized audience is far better than a large unmonetized one, as we see in the LA Weekly example above. In this vein, audience education is very important. We strive to guide readers away from ad-based Web 2.0 platforms to ad-free Web 3 platforms. Why would anyone choose to pay for articles they can get for free? The answer is that they aren\u2019t getting anything for free. On Web 2.0, consumers\u2019 privacy is invaded, their data scraped and sold, their content corrupted. They are already are paying, just with their labor, information, and attention. Remember, If you aren\u2019t paying for a service, you are the product. Every time you post on Web 2.0\u2014either as a writer or a sharer\u2014you are micropaying the company that owns the platform you\u2019re using, as they sell your content for cents per engagement. It\u2019s time to reverse that flow to ensure that those who generate digital value receive a fair wage for work performed. On December 14th, 2017, Vandal Press became an official partner publication of Medium, the most developed Web 3 content platform currently online. Our articles there have already generated tens of thousands of claps, and made thousands of dollars for our writers, all directly from readers without any corporate or advertiser interference. We are currently in the process of expanding to Steemit, GAB, and Patreon. Our central goal is finding great writers whose writing isn\u2019t properly valued under the current system, and getting them paid fairly. Our content is highly curated, but only in the sense that it\u2019s good. There are currently no guidelines as to what sort of work we want to publish. There is no particular audience we want to cater to, no political statement we want to make. As we grow, however, we know that washing our hands of politics will not be satisfactory. Many of you will have questions about what we stand for, as you should with any publisher/media company, as all publishers/media companies have political leanings even if they say they don\u2019t. In our hyper-divided time, we will inevitably be painted as on one side or the other, no matter what we say about objectivity. Therefore, we\u2019re going to eschew objectivity from the start. We will instead attempt to be completely transparent about what we believe and what we want our content to achieve, so that we may be held to a clearly articulated standard from now on. Vandal Press publishes written art. All art is not political, but the publication of art is inevitably political. A painting found laying on the street is not political. A painting hung in a gallery, on a private collectors wall, in a museum, anywhere, is political. Supposedly apolitical art supports the politics of the authority which publishes it. Ornate patterns could not be less political taken alone, but become highly political engraved on the wall of a mosque. A vapid Hollywood comedy is apolitical taken alone, but becomes political when distributed by a powerful studio. All publishers have core political ideologies. Political ideologies fall on a spectrum between compassion and conscientiousness. Compassion focuses on those who need the most help. Conscientiousness focuses on the wellbeing of the community as a whole. The interests of the few must be balanced by the interests of the community as a whole. The community suffers if the wellbeing of the lowest or highest minorities always outbalances the health of the whole. The individual suffers if the wellbeing of the whole always outbalances the health of the lowest or highest minorities. All people are created equal. No one human is better than another in a metaphysical sense. The idea that there is a divine order of humans based on genetic background is delusional. Given infinite environments, a human of any phenotype has equal probability of rising to unlimited greatness. The same is true of communities. All people are not created the same. Beauty is real. Greatness is real. People are naturally hierarchical. They make value judgements. While these are subject to constant change, they are real and important. Equality of opportunity gives beauty and greatness the freedom to flourish. Equality of outcome eliminates freedom, and thus beauty and greatness entirely. No effort by any community to enforce equality of outcome has ever succeeded. Freedom is the most important concept. Much more important than the concept of fairness. Art is a product of free thought. Free thought is destroyed by total authority, as in a totalitarian state\u200a\u2014\u200athe tyranny of man. Free thought is also destroyed by total lack of authority\u200a\u2014\u200athe tyranny of nature. Free thought exists in the balance between authority and lack of authority. It is a free mind navigating between the two. Free thought thus requires decentralized authority. Art has nothing to do with objective truth, and everything to do with subjective truth. Every human being holds good and evil within them. The primary struggle is the individual\u2019s battle between the two. The secondary struggle is society\u2019s battle against individuals who have lost the fight against evil within themselves. No objective criteria signify a victory against evil. Such victories differ within each of us, and within time. The quality of a piece of art depends on how well an artist paints the portrait of their own subjective battle between good and evil. All art is speech, but not all speech is art. There are forms of speech\u2014threats, commands, coercions\u2014that are capable of being evil. Written art, however, cannot be evil, because it is standalone and wholly subjective. Believing a poem or an essay or a book is evil is like believing a painting is evil; it is pure delusion. This is why we have no problem reading books written by serial killers years after the fact. Serial killers are evil. Serial killers\u2019 writings are not. Written truth is always good, even when written by an evil person, because it is helpful in understanding evil. Anyone angry at written art is angry at truth. They are angry at free thought. They are angry at freedom, the most important concept known to man. This manifesto is art. Vandal Press publishes written art.

Another challenge we have is letting you know what you can do with it (in a nice way). We are working on several fronts to improve the visibility of public domain and rights-clear content. We moved one step in that direction today with the launch of our Free to Use and Reuse page. This page features themed sets of content (e.g., travel posters, presidential portraits, Civil War drawings) that are all free to use and reuse, meaning there are no known copyright restrictions associated with this content. In other words, you can do whatever you want with it. When we redesigned the Library\u2019s home page in late 2016 we began featuring free-to-use sets at the bottom of the page. Each set displayed on the home page is now available from our new Free to Use and Reuse page, and we\u2019ll continue to add to this archive. The set featured on the home page now is a selection of photos with dogs. Here are a few teasers. Please note that these sets are just a small sample of the Library\u2019s digital collections available for your free use. Our digital collections comprise millions of items including books, newspapers, manuscripts, prints and photos, maps, musical scores, films, sound recordings and more. Whenever possible, each collection has its own rights statement which you should consult for guidance on use.

Very few still love him. Currently, more people want him impeached than reelected. Personally, I think that he is a buffoon. He has no idea what he is doing, and is somehow dumber than me. And that\u2019s sayin\u2019 something. But there is an upside to this, a huge one\u200a\u2014\u200athis entire shebang is almost a good thing. The thing is, democracy is a catch-22; it must fail to work. The reason why America exists is precisely because the people that made it were in a oppressive government. If they weren\u2019t in an oppressive government, they would not have made it. Throughout American history, the government has had a long history of oppression. From slavery to Segregation to what is still happening today. There is almost no oppression today. There is still the occasional stuff based on race and anti-birth control laws, but that is nothing compared to what it could be. If there is no oppression, no problems, and everything is taken care of by the politicians for too long, the people will become too trusting of the government. Take gun control for example. Guns are granted in the United States by the second amendment. This amendment allows for a \u201cwell-regulated militia\u201d run by the people. This is meant to allow the people to perform a forceful takeover of the government if it is out of control enough to warrant that. Some people, usually on the left want guns to be banned outright, or so strictly controlled to stop terrorism\u200a\u2014\u200abut this would stop the people from getting the numbers to perform a revolt. If a government becomes oppressive, the people would be helpless. The people don\u2019t understand the consequences of this, which is a problem. Yet they still think that this is necessary even though terrorists killed 105 people in 2017 while about 120 veterans took their life. Also, there were 10,500 cases of children ingesting or being exposed to detergent pods. Yes, the meme. Donald Trump is a train wreck. He has no idea how to president, or how to talk, or think\u2026 or read\u2026 But this is unfortunately good for the United States. His presence and administration will cause people to realize that the government cannot be trusted, that it is not something that is guaranteed to protect you. The government is messy, its disorganized, it cannot possibly work, it is inherently flawed. But that\u2019s okay. This is only a problem it we do not realize it\u200a\u2014\u200aif we understand how the government works and how to make it work, we can make it more of that perfect, protective, organized, clean government that we strive for. But even then, our children can fall for the same trap. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out. Gay. Alias.

Not a cloud in the sky, still early enough before the rest of the world took its first breath and perfect for the beach. Armed with a writing pad, a book I had yet to finish, lotion and a chair I bounded for one of my favorite spots isolated enough where I knew I could set up shop right in front of the ocean without having to hear anything other than the lap of waves, the rustle of grape trees and the call of seabirds. At least for a few hours, anyway. As I mentioned it was quite early and I wasn\u2019t expecting to find anyone else there. However, there was someone else there. Someone I knew and well and had not spoken to in over ten years. I pushed aside the awkwardness of the moment, the reasons that pulled us apart, and just settled my chair beside hers where a conversation began and the details of our lives\u200a\u2014\u200awhat we\u2019d been doing, where we were now\u200a\u2014\u200aflowed out. For what felt like hours I sat there listening to everything she had to say. She had recently turned sixty-five and despite all her monetary wealth, two successful daughters and the impending birth of her first grandchild, she was not happy. A deep hole existed where there should have been nothing but joy. This was not something I could tell her. I did not live her life. I did not see where she began, what she had envisioned for herself. Those paramount things she hoped to achieve. Taking stock is a reality check. It\u2019s something we all go through at some point, if not many points, during the course of our lives. And while I\u2019m not certain they\u2019re always productive assessments, I do believe they\u2019re absolutely critical in helping us stay on track. A feat, which for most of us humans, is not always an easy thing to do. One friend when he turned forty suffered a heart attack. Another quit his job and went to work for Starbucks. And although I personally never experienced a mid-life crisis, per se, well, not the kind anyway that entails trashing your clothes, liquidating your 401 (k) to buy a sports car, or giving yourself a do-over with Miss Clairol Pink #3, I did however wind up around that same forty mile-marker in the throes of a divorce and menopause. Two messy hardships I did not ask for. And two hardships that would drive any normal woman way off the deep end. So deep there were days I forgot to breathe, I forgot my children, and they, in turn, forgot about me. But somehow I got through it. Goo Goo G\u2019joob hallelujah. I survived my forties, my fifties seemingly intact, and now that I\u2019m here at the sixty plus stage over the proverbial hill sitting on a Cornflake after the van has come and gone, I can finally, honestly say I like where I am. I like who I am. Cellulite, age spots, jiggly bat underarms and all. Yes, I stopped fighting that mother ship a long time ago. When shit happens around you, when those you love die, a ground-breaking seed inside your head grows. And like a breath of fresh air, the I\u2019m-going-to-set-the-world-on-fire kind of dreams that once consumed you, are thrust elsewhere. On your children and your grandchildren, for the simple reason you\u2019re just so happy to be alive. Joan Didion summed it up best: So much of our lives is spent reviewing parts of our existence that have become nothing more than wreckage upon a shore. Things that cannot be undone for all the tea in China. I hope you realize this sooner versus later. I hope everything that bogs down your life, that keeps that hole in your heart from filling, falls away with the simple understanding what matters most, is what lays ahead. And the only person you have to make happy\u00a0\u2026 is you. Three years ago, after struggling with life butting in, with blank pages, with characters who wanted to tell a much different story than the one I intended, I finally completed my first book. It was the ultimate cherry. The sense of accomplishment that had eluded me for so long. And the interesting thing is, looking back, I realized it could have happened a lot sooner had I simply understood the difference between writing for others and writing for myself, and the flower of relevancy blooms from within. I believe it takes great passion, great courage to live your life out loud with the sort of honesty of mind where things that feel shallow sink, and things that feel true float upon the surface as you give voice to all those inner frailties that makes us human. Because we\u2019re all screwed up\u200a\u2014\u200ato some degree or another\u200a\u2014\u200aand I don\u2019t see anyone exempt from this messy pool of mankind. Not you, not me, not even Mr. Rogers with his snappy sweater and picture-perfect neighborhood. Look, all I\u2019m saying is that the closer we get to our number being called, re-adjust the lens. Ride the peace train of happiness wherever it takes you. And if that means crusading for the homeless, opening a cupcake shop, knitting sweaters for Etsy, swimming the Atlantic, or simply retiring to the west coast of Florida with all your Jujubes intact to get you there, then by all means\u00a0\u2026 go for it!

Not only did I lose pretty much everything and ended up in the ER twice I began to think how I still had it in me to educate myself, gain skills and start a new career. Are questions I\u2019ve asked myself\u2026 In around Thanksgiving of 2015 I ran into a personality test via facebook from a trusted Leader and clicked it because I was curious. It so happened I was pretty excited as it was aligned with who I was. I\u2019ve tried Myer-Briggs tests as well and those tests have also been pretty accurate only difference there\u2019s lots of information and I wanted something simple and to the point. (Let\u2019s cut to the chase) And that was okay because initially I was not planning on making a career out of it after all I was fairly doing good as a Harvard Certified Life Coach skyping clients. I worked from home and made a career online helping people unlock mindsets and overcome challenges with neuroscience techniques. After reading what I\u2019m like and how to captivate clients for my business I used what little information gained and applied it to my business. It really helped me and it worked! Being that I was also helping to passionately spread the word about these tests in social media and how it can help others I got fired-up and also joined a facebook group with people desiring to learn more and sharing wonderful stories of success and also others having questions. The author of the book was running the group. (Sally Hogshead) Found out a new book was coming out and honestly I was not interested in purchasing the book. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have the time to read it and didn\u2019t want to invest anymore time as I believed I had enough information to grow my little coaching business. The reason I was not interested in purchasing the book was because I asked a couple of Entrepreneurs (lady bosses) in social media about fascination. And many have heard it before actually years ago and didn\u2019t show much interest. I told them I must be living under a rock because I\u2019ve never heard of fascination! They seemed bored, I was excited! Very different vibe however I didn\u2019t let it stop me from pursuing in learning. Once I purchased the book I purchased all the books on fascination I can get my hands on and decided to master it. Today my life is very different. What started as a hobby and sharing tests in social media I\u2019ve actually made it into a career. I\u2019ve continued being a Life Coach and also coach fascination. Many say it\u2019s difficult however I knew this was destiny as I grasped it really quick. In a year or so\u00a0\u2026 I\u2019ve applied fascination to politics, social media, my coaching clients, my community etc\u2026 I give a ton of value and that has landed me major eyeballs through my blogs from presidents around the world, brands, Entrepreneurs, Hollywood and so on\u2026 I even landed my first paid film project with San Pedro Film Festival! (In my backyard!) To read more on this hollywood trailer when Hollywood was in my neighborhood click here And for some weird reason I knew I\u2019ve met with destiny the moment I seen this trailer. This year I plan to level up by creating a landing page, website and a youtube channel specifically to gain leads to my coaching business. Of course I will give out tips, value and share storytelling to my viewers. Recently ran into a millennial business owner which ran a business of cell phone covers and gadgets through Amazon and decided to open a brick and mortar in our city however he\u2019s not doing well as he\u2019s not getting much traffic. We all know by now we need social media to bring in traffic and believe he knows it too. I\u2019d like to speak about his story in my upcoming videos and the importance of having both a brick and mortar and drive traffic through #socialmedia Since we are now in 2018 and statistics show this year many will open their online businesses you may ask\u2026 I can\u2019t read minds however I can give you ideas\u2026 Check it out\u00a0\u2026 If you\u2019re a passionate person, love food, love concerts and always speak of LOVE I suggest you create something that will connect you with your fans If you\u2019re into technology, space or just plain odd and love to shock people I suggest you create an app, learn more about virtual reality, attend technology events and socialize with professionals. Innovation is Entrepreneurship you may want to invest in cryptocurrencies or open a business via Amazon or teach online. If you\u2019re detailed and love algorithms perhaps you can become a financial planner for a company or run your own company helping others become more organized. Alert people are detailed and great at planning! If you love high-lux fashion, expensive vehicles, love to achieve things perhaps you can create a business suited for high end clientele or celebrities. Prestigious companies are about elevation. The higher the better\u00a0\u2026 These are just some examples\u00a0\u2026 of course there are more and just throwing ideas there.

This practice of exaggerating how my dark-skin didn\u2019t measure up continued with my boarding school mates\u200a\u2014\u200awho once compared my looks to one of the popular girls\u200a\u2014\u200aand concluded that even though we looked alike\u200a\u2014\u200ashe was prettier. We did sort of resemble each other\u200a\u2014\u200abut she wasn\u2019t prettier. She was just light-skinned. That same rhetoric was responsible for the infatuation and fascination assigned to the biracial students who almost always won beauty competitions and anything else that required the adulation of their prized features. Interestingly enough\u200a\u2014\u200aI never pressured myself into sourcing ways to solve the issue of my dark skin\u200a\u2014\u200athe way other Nigerian women have resolved to do\u200a\u2014\u200aat the risk of their health. Skin bleaching was a dirty secret when I was growing up\u200a\u2014\u200abecause even though it was glaringly obvious that Mrs. Kalu was indulging in potent solutions that couldn\u2019t quite penetrate her knuckles, elbows or feet\u200a\u2014\u200awe had to act as if her new complexion wasn\u2019t weird as fuck. My mother did an excellent job boosting my ego\u200a\u2014\u200aand as a result there was hardly a time when I stared at the mirror and imagined how much more desirable I would be if the gods had been a little more miserly with the strokes of deep chocolate. However\u200a\u2014\u200awhen I moved to the States to pursue my college degree\u200a\u2014\u200aI was greeted with hard truths of what it means to be a \u201cregular Black girl\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aduring an era when such a disposition was guaranteed to get you nowhere\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially in industries that catered to fashion and entertainment. The nineties were a rough era for Black women that didn\u2019t evoke the sentiments of Halle Berry, Vanessa Williams, Nia Long or Jada Pinkett. Music videos by some of the best R&B bands like Boyz II Men, Dru Hill, Jodeci, etc, always featured women who were selected for looking \u201ckinda Black\u201d without the restrictions that apply. They had to have the curly-bouncy hair, green or light gray eyes, narrow noses, nicely curled lips and a skin tone that made the male squad feel manly enough in their much darker hues. The fashion industry was the biggest surprise\u200a\u2014\u200aas virtually every magazine cover celebrated the gross appeal of \u201cheroin chic\u201d and \u201cgrunge\u201d with images of pale-skinned templates that looked half-dead\u200a\u2014\u200awith messy hair, eyes caked with dark eyeliner and impossibly thin limbs sprawled all over the page. Supermodel\u200a\u2014\u200aNaomi Campbell has reached iconic status due to the fact that in the more than two decades of her illustrious career\u200a\u2014\u200athere really hasn\u2019t been much competition\u200a\u2014\u200ato thwart her reign as the \u201cBlack model\u201d of \u201cevery moment.\u201d Tyra Banks came close but even she isn\u2019t as active or revered as Campbell\u200a\u2014\u200awho despite her infamous temper and high demands\u200a\u2014\u200ahas managed to maintain the momentum that none of her dark-skinned counterparts can replicate. African models like Alek Wek and Ataui Deng who hail from Sudan\u200a\u2014\u200awere embraced based on the gorgeous peculiarity of their existence in an industry that will be faithful to the standard default\u200a\u2014\u200ano matter how often they choose to deviate from the norm\u200a\u2014\u200ain a quest to be \u201ctrendy\u201d or fashionably exploratory. The truth is that the realm of fashion and beauty from a global standpoint is still the absolute worst when it comes to fairly recognizing the varied versions of expressiveness and viability. The unrelenting message that is dispelled through ad campaigns from major brands has been consistent and damaging for Black women who are just now beginning to experience a slight shift in their favor. The nineties were cruel\u200a\u2014\u200abut the systematic refusal to appreciate the healthy appeal of dark-skinned beauties is still a major disease without a cure. Magazines like Sports Illustrated, GQ, FHM, and Maxim\u200a\u2014\u200athat are in the business of celebrating the scorching hotness of women\u200a\u2014\u200ahave demonstrated their bias towards Black women who are too dark or too ethnic to secure enough slots to endorse their attractiveness. If you do a search of all the women that have graced the covers of these publications\u200a\u2014\u200athe results are overwhelmingly White women\u200a\u2014\u200aand once you scan the pages\u200a\u2014\u200ait doesn\u2019t get much better. The models that walk the annual Victoria Secret Fashion Show are mostly White with a a couple of models of color added as a security measure to help deflect the threat of non-diversity\u200a\u2014\u200awhich the current climate mandates. And this overtly transparent way to safely indulge in the bad habit of exclusivity with sporadic episodes of inclusivity\u200a\u2014\u200aactually does very little to encourage much-needed progress. And so this is when the tools of social media actually do more good than harm. The positive images of dark-skinned women\u200a\u2014\u200awho are content enough to show off their beauty as proof of their supreme confidence is a righteous act of defiance that makes Instagram worth the daily indulgence. Chewing Gum creator and actress Michaela Cole is the dopest Black woman alive at the moment\u200a\u2014\u200adue to her tendency to use her unique heritage as a canvas of self-love with splashes of prideful homage to features that are still not regarded with the respect and acceptability they deserve. Cole\u200a\u2014\u200awho is British-Ghanaian doesn\u2019t sugarcoat the fuckery of the industry she chose to play in\u200a\u2014\u200aand her honesty extends to the way she\u2019s regarded by Black men\u200a\u2014\u200aparticularly the ones who try too hard to avoid courting women who match her looks. As Fashion Week commences\u200a\u2014\u200afashion editors who have done a very poor job recruiting Black cover girls\u200a\u2014\u200aunless they\u2019re names are\u200a\u2014\u200aLupita, Beyonce or Rihanna\u200a\u2014\u200awill once again perch on the front row and take in runways filled with mostly White models.

In the meantime\u200a\u2014\u200athe fight continues through the sturdy work of well-positioned influencers\u200a\u2014\u200awho are using their privilege for the purpose of advancing the visibility of a woefully neglected population. Historic entries like Black Panther from director Ryan Coogler that boasts an all-Black cast\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding women who are deliciously dark-skinned\u200a\u2014\u200ais definitely a step in the right direction.

Both Rae and Orji couldn\u2019t have achieved this feat fifteen years ago\u200a\u2014\u200abut the mantle of diversity has ushered in the \u201ctrend of flexibility\u201d that hopefully will evolve into something tangible. Rihanna\u2019s new beauty line\u200a\u2014\u200aFenty Beauty is poised to become the unbeatable force in a market that is only now trying to capitalize on the swell of consumers that have been waiting long enough to access their \u201ctrue match.\u201d As the word keeps spreading\u200a\u2014\u200athe goal is to arm future generations of dark-skinned girls with the ammunition they need to be whatever they want to be with no reservations. There should be no doubt of the heights that can be reached or the roles they can embody as seductive assassins in blockbusters\u200a\u2014\u200aor sought-after supermodels who are able to give Naomi Campbell a run for her money. It\u2019s time to make \u201cdiversity\u201d a way of life\u200a\u2014\u200arather than the \u201cbreak from tradition\u201d that has a shelf life. And the time starts now.

Given that mastery and focus are big values of mine, I neither like to not be good at something nor to do something that isn\u2019t \u201cgetting me anywhere.\u201d The challenge, of course, is that personal growth is a more important value to me. You don\u2019t continue to grow without trying new things, which means you\u2019ve got to embrace not being good at those new things or them not paying off immediately. A way I\u2019ve gotten around this and coached other people to do the same is by implementing a new project cocoon. The cocoon is for both you and the project. It\u2019s for you so that you give yourself a safe place to not be good at something, and it\u2019s for the project so that it doesn\u2019t get killed before it\u2019s had a chance to bloom. For instance, when I started my podcast, I made the commitment to publishing 50 episodes no matter how much I didn\u2019t like it in the beginning or if I didn\u2019t see listener growth or excitement in the beginning. Of course, I knew around the 40th episode or so that we\u2019d keep doing it, but it would\u2019ve been easy to stop earlier on. Similarly, when we started publishing two episodes per week, I wanted to make sure we did it for a bit to get used to it before evaluating it too much. We ultimately decided that publishing two episodes a week displaced too much that mattered more, but we waited to see what happened first. I\u2019ve done the same thing with workout schedules, productivity experiments, and other social projects like Periscope, Anchor, daily blogging, and so on. Here\u2019s the deal: if it\u2019s worth doing and worth doing well, it\u2019s worth doing badly at the beginning. Expecting to be good at things from the beginning keeps us from being masterful in the end. And that said, this is not an invitation to bail at things you\u2019re good at, either, just for the sake of self-development masochism.\u00a0;) Charlie Gilkey is an author, business advisor, and podcaster who teaches people how to start finishing what matters most.

I mean, of course it does: Type spells out words. So let me rephrase that: Typefaces have a way of speaking to us. Comic Sans can\u2019t be taken seriously. Helvetica, ubiquitous, clean, used everywhere from corporate logos to the New York City subway, is often used for clarity and neutrality. But what if you need your font to represent a whole country? That\u2019s the aim of Sweden Sans, a typeface commissioned by the Swedish government. It\u2019s designed to give a consistent voice to the country\u2019s international promotions, from Sweden\u2019s official compilation of pop music to a slick new national website. According to its creators, Stockholm design agency S\u00f6derhavet and font designer Stefan Hattenbach, Sweden Sans is a \u201cmodern\u201d but edgy typeface with some local tweaks\u200a\u2014\u200aa filled ring over the letter \u201c\u00e5,\u201d for instance, and a line that cuts through the zero\u200a\u2014\u200aand takes its inspiration from old street signs. Sans is meant to encapsulate fuzzy Scandinavian concepts\u200a\u2014\u200aprogressivism, authenticity, lagom (Swedish for \u201cjust the right amount\u201d). So how does it do it? \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty open typeface. They\u2019re simple shapes,\u201d Hattenbach says over the phone. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked on the spaces between the letters to try to keep it light and airy.\u201d Wide holes inside of an enclosed \u201cp\u201d or \u201co\u201d might have the same effect. To a type nerd, things get technical, and fast. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty easy to tell that the descriptions are a typical sales pitch,\u201d says Rikard Heberling, a graphic designer based in Stockholm. But ultimately Sweden Sans is more about promoting \u201cthe myths of a certain Swedish taste or mentality,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is merely a branding tool.\u201d And as branding goes, though, there is an unfortunate and glaring analogy\u200a\u2014\u200aBlackletter, the thick, Gothic lettering that appeared in 12th century Europe and ended up synonymous with the Third Reich. Its proponents thought blackletter was the superior way to represent the German language, but it ended up discredited as \u201cJewish,\u201d and subsequently banished. Sweden Sans, too, has some nationalist underpinnings. In 2004, an expert appointed by the government argued it was \u201cimportant\u201d to take more pride in national traditions. A decade later, Swedish nationalism is mainstream, the anti-immigration party is the country\u2019s third largest political group, and soccer star Zlatan Ibrahimovic has recited the national anthem in an epic car commercial with the tagline \u201cMade By Sweden.\u201d \u201cIt began almost as a diplomatic thing for government bodies working in both business and diplomacy,\u201d Hattenbach says. \u201cBut nationalism is a bit of a trend right now.

Newton\u2019s simple F = ma and Einstein\u2019s E = mc\u00b2 are simple equations that house profound truths and enable so much to be derived; the quark model and General Relativity are simple to describe but incredibly deep theories that govern the interactions of particles; ideas like supersymmetry, grand unification and string theory extend the known physical symmetries to even greater levels. Many physicists think the way to new, profound truths about existence is through more symmetries and greater elegance. By applying new avenues of mathematics to the Universe, we seek a deeper truth to reality than our current understanding. But the original \u201celegant Universe\u201d model, Kepler\u2019s Mysterium Cosmographicum, was symmetric, beautiful, and based in never-before-applied mathematics. In a great cautionary tale, it was also an enormous scientific failure. Prior to Kepler, there were three major systems describing the Universe: Writing decades before Galileo rose to prominence, Kepler thought that the heliocentric ideas had promise, but they needed something more than just circles. They needed an elegant mathematical structure to support them. In a stroke of brilliance, at just 24 years of age, Kepler published what he thought was the most beautiful idea he ever had. With six planets to orbit the Sun (none beyond Saturn would be discovered until nearly 200 years later), Kepler recognized that there must be six unique orbits: one for each of the planets. But why six? Why not more; why not fewer? And why did they have the spacings that we observed? The connection between these orbits and mathematics was his idea for the elegant Universe: You see, in three dimensions, there are exactly five solids that you can build out of regular polygons: no more, no less. Discovered by the ancient Greeks over 2,000 years prior and known as the five Platonic solids (though they predate Plato substantially), Kepler envisioned a series of nested spheres, circumscribed and inscribed around each of the five solids, resulting in six spherical orbits for the planets to move along. The sphere of Mercury would be the innermost one, inscribed within an octahedron, the regular polygon made up of eight equilateral triangles. Circumscribed around that is the sphere holding Venus, which itself is inscribed within an icosahedron, a 20-sided polygon made of equilateral triangles. Around that is Earth\u2019s sphere, which is inscribed within a dodecahedron, which has 12 sides each made out of a pentagon. Circumscribing the dodecahedron is the sphere of Mars, which then itself is inscribed within the tetrahedron: a four-sided polygon where each side is an equilateral triangle. Around the tetrahedron is the sphere of Jupiter, which is inscribed within a cube: the final solid. At last, enclosing the cube is one final sphere, where the planet Saturn orbits. Kepler\u2019s idea was nothing short of brilliant, and each of the ratios for the planetary radii were predicted exactly by his model. The problem came when you compared them with observations. While the ratios for Mercury to Venus, Venus to Earth, and Earth to Mars lined up pretty well, the final two worlds failed to adhere to Kepler\u2019s predicted ratios. In particular, it orbit of Mars, and its failure to conform to a circle of any type, was the downfall of Kepler\u2019s model. Even though Kepler continued to work on it, even publishing a second edition more than 20 years later, his most remarkable contribution came from doing what most scientists can never bring themselves to do: abandoning their most cherished hypothesis. NASA / JPL The orbits of the planets in the inner solar system aren\u2019t exactly circular, but they\u2019re quite close, with Mercury and Mars having the biggest departures and the greatest ellipticities. Additionally, objects like comets and asteroids make ellipses as well and obey the rest of Kepler\u2019s laws, so long as they\u2019re bound to the Sun. It wasn\u2019t nested spheres that predicted planetary motion correctly, but ellipses. Kepler\u2019s three laws, that planets move in ellipses around the Sun, that they sweep out equal areas in equal times, and that the ratio of the squares of the orbital period to the cube of the semimajor axis are a constant for any central mass, both contradicted and superseded his Mysterium Cosmographicum. The success of his elliptical orbits paved the way for Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation, and ushered in the science of astrophysics. Despite his undying love for his most brilliant idea, it was the less elegant model that better described our Universe. By leaving aside his own hopes and instead letting the data be his guide, he was able to make the advance that a lesser mind would have failed to discover. There is a temptation towards reductionism in physics: to describe as much as possible with as little as possible. The idea that there exists a theory of everything, or a single theory that can predict and describe everything that can be predicted or described in the Universe to the maximum possible accuracy, is the ultimate dream of a great many scientists. Yet there is no guarantee, even in principle, that it\u2019s possible for such a dream to come true. As famed physicist Lincoln Wolfenstein put it: Elegance, beauty, and reductionism may offer some tremendous opportunities for successfully predicting new physical phenomena, but there\u2019s no guarantee these predictions will be borne out in reality. When it comes to uncovering the next great breakthrough in fundamental science, our hopes and dreams that we\u2019ll be closer to a unified theory of everything through mathematical beauty and additional symmetry is a common one, but is no sure thing. May we all be as open to whatever the data tells us as Kepler was, and be willing to follow it, no matter where it leads.

The digital world has emerged slowly but surely over the last few decades, and it now affects every aspect of our lives. It unfolded in small, discrete changes. We started to communicate differently. We started to work differently. We started to think differently. Information, once scarce, now threatens to overwhelm us. Our old habits\u200a\u2014\u200abased on scarcity\u200a\u2014\u200aare counterproductive in this digital world of abundance. Education has not prepared us. Social media whips us into a frenzy over the littlest things. And financial incentives have been distorted to keep us as distracted from dawn to dusk. We must face these changes. Otherwise they will lead us toward a life of compulsive distraction that leaves behind nothing. We will be keep getting caught in this digital trap if we\u2019re not careful. Fortunately we are not expected to figure out the digital world on our own. Elite groups of entrepreneurs are thriving in the digital world, pointing us toward the correct behaviors. Focus on a compelling mission. Push yourself to take action as quickly as possible. Structure your day to stay on task. Your RESET sequence starts with one small step. Acting boldly is the most useful skill in a world of limitless distractions. Purpose follows action as often as action follows purpose, so we can\u2019t fall back on the convenient excuses of perfectionism. Just get started. With our bias toward action in place, we can focus on supercharging ourselves. We will be guided toward our areas of potential mastery by feedback. Then we can develop those unique strengths that inspire others to collaborate on missions of true value to humanity. A supportive structure lets us keep up the momentum that we developed with bold steps. That\u2019s why we have to rally the people around us. If you need to learn something, find a teacher. If you need encouragement, turn to a cheerleader. If you want to reinforce a lesson, find a student. Success is ultimately determined by our daily behavior. We can launch ourselves each morning, overflowing with energy to tackle the most important tasks we face. And we can dodge the distractions thrown at us by the digital world by creating space away from our devices, and by engaging with them more carefully. We must be focused on consistency. Small wins over time will eventually make the difference by cultivating deep expertise. And then we will be succeeding every day, no matter what life throws at us. We will be doing exactly what we want to do and doing it well, not choking on the latest pointless notifications on social media. A new life is opening up to us, if we choose to rise to the challenge. We will become more confident, focused, inspired, and\u200a\u2014\u200amost important\u200a\u2014\u200auseful to others. This is the natural consequence of our evolution as we adapt to the digital world, and adapt the digital world to us! Diligence is the price of our newfound freedom. The ever-present risk is sliding backwards toward a life of convenience. That\u2019s why we need to lean on the powerful combination of habits, mindset, and community that we discussed in this book. Your first RESET will not be your last. Whatever mission you choose, the digital world does not stand still. New opportunities will emerge, new ways to build mastery and create value in the lives of others. And you will pursue them, reshaping your purpose and environment to suit these new goals. The benefits of the digital world will open up as you gain control over your impulses and your environment. The ability to make an impact on the lives of others, the deep enjoyment of your day-to-day work, the instant access to useful information and a global community, the massive financial opportunities, and all the rest of it. You do not need anything else to beat the odds and become one of the success stories. Here are a few facts that you probably didn\u2019t know. Each one should be enough to blow your mind, and hopefully push the limits of what you believe is possible in your own life. The world is safer today (whatever day you are reading this) than ever before in human history. In 2015 the global poverty rate dropped below 10% for the first time ever. Scientists are using people\u2019s stem cells to grow them new organs. Scientists are also experimenting with nanobots\u200a\u2014\u200atiny robots\u200a\u2014\u200ato target and kill cancer cells. Google and Ford are working together to develop cars that drive themselves. So are Lyft and General Motors. All kinds of software is being developed right now by computers that can improve themselves. In 2005 there were 1 billion people connected to the internet, and since then that number has almost quadrupled. There are high-end virtual reality systems you can already buy, or you can use a smartphone and some cardboard to make your own virtual reality system. Kind of overwhelming, isn\u2019t it? These amazing changes are all happening right now. Think about that. We really are living in the middle of a special time in history: the emergence and rapid spread of the digital world. The horizons are expanding all around us. All we need is a workable approach to capitalize on these amazing opportunities. I want you to develop deep confidence in your ability to RESET and then keep evolving. And we both know that won\u2019t happen by staying distracted and hoping for the best. You have to defy the digital world that wants you to be a spectator. You need to RESET. That means excavating the missions that excite you with a compelling Why? and Who?, pushing yourself to take action, and shaping your environment so you consistently have a positive impact on the world. Revolutionize your mind and your behavior. What are you waiting for? The End. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

By the time they get to breakfast the next day, Mateo has managed to let the whole family know that his parents are exploring their feelings, or rather \u201cexploring each other with kisses\u201d. But Alba doesn\u2019t get a chance to celebrate, not Rogelio a chance to object, because a phonecall interrupts their family breakfast. Due to low sales, Jane has been dropped by her publisher. Though her family tries to convince her that these news aren\u2019t as bad as she thinks, Jane\u2019s usual optimism has been dimmed by heartbreak and disappointment. In a very Petra-like moment of harsh realism, she reminds her loved ones that \u201cvery few women of color get published and, when [they] do, [they] cannot afford to screw it up, because [they] don\u2019t get a second chance.\u201d This newfound sense of realism clashes with Jane\u2019s writing. She tries to start working on a new project, but her romantic novel alter ego doesn\u2019t get to flirt with the charming horse-riding teacher who looks just like Rafael for long, instead getting interrupted by worries about Mateo\u2019s expectations and what Jane and Rafael\u2019s relationship will mean for their son. Meanwhile, Rafael is also trying to appease Mateo, promising that Jane is welcome to visit at his new apartment anytime she wants after he\u2019s finished moving out of the Villanueva household. He doesn\u2019t try for appeasement when he cancels his standing brunch with Petra over an email. Petra is visibly hurt when she\u2019s texting him, but hides her vulnerability away when she goes to ask Jane for help. She expects that Jane will help her win Rafael\u2019s forgiveness, but Jane refuses. And, not just that, but she cancels on the family brunch too! Jane is always ready to see the best in people but, she says then, Petra might have pushed just too far. (No, the scene didn\u2019t cut to Anezka falling off the balcony, and I personally found that to be a missed opportunity.) Realist Jane also has more than a few doubts about her blooming romance with Rafael. Yes, Mateo is a big factor, even more so when the kid misinterprets Rafael and Jane\u2019s words and decides that his mom is the one who doesn\u2019t want them to be a family. But she\u2019s also thinking about her recent breakup, her flaking career and, mayne most worrying of all, Rafael\u2019s relationship with Katherine and what that means for him, and thus for them. Rafael promises he won\u2019t be going back to that greedy, destructive, angry place, but Jane isn\u2019t so sure. The other Jane, Jane Ramos, sternly refuses to let Petra call her \u201cJ.R.\u201d no matter how annoyed Petra is by mentions of Jane, Jane, Jane at every moment. She tells Petra that the police need some blueprints for their investigation, and in discussing the case, Petra mentions Law & Order, which gives way for the Narrator to use the Law & Order theme and classic zoom at least a dozen times through the episode. (He promises he will stop each time, but he never does.) It also allows for Jane Ramos to mention that his ex girlfriend was a TV writer, and that TV writers are big liars. Should we take it to mean that, unlike what the writers at Jane The Virgin might suggest, not every gay and bisexual person is an evil conspirator? Because, with this one-line confirmation, this makes Ramos\u2026 what? The sixth morally questionable or straight up evil LGB character in the show? Ramos is recapping all the hateful things Petra has said to or about her sister in her emails when Krishna interrupts them, letting Petra know that Rafael is outside. Krishna is, coincidentally, the only gay character who\u2019s been in the show regularly for a long time and has at no point been shown to be evil, but that might be because we know absolutely nothing about her outside of her sexuality and the fact that she\u2019s basically a stepping mat for Petra. But I won\u2019t lie: after Krishna\u2019s snarky response to Petra in this scene, I\u2019m actually rooting for her to get fed up with her shitty boss and do something, maybe not villainous, but mildly bad, like egg her car or alter her schedule so Petra will be fifteen minutes late to all of her meetings. Elsewhere, Rogelio has no meetings to be late to. He\u2019s announced his decision to be a stay at home dad to everybody, and he begged Darci to let him take care of Baby while she\u2019s working. Today, after Xo and Alba leave for work, his first day as a Dad-Nanny begins. He spends it posting selfies to social media, and Darci calls to remind him that only B-list celebrities use their children to boost their social media presence. And to remind him that Baby needs to poop, too! Finally, Rafael takes Jane and Mateo to meet his new apartment, warning them to set expectations low. Mateo is disappointed, and when Rafael reminds him that he did tell him to keep expectations low, Mateo replies, deadpan, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what that meant.\u201d The kid is really shining this episode, and he\u2019s cute enough that his moods and tantrums don\u2019t get annoying. Still, Jane and Rafael do need to do something about their son\u2019s anger, and so they stage a goodbye in which Rafael pretends to \u201ckick out\u201d Jane of the apartment to be alone with Mateo, so he won\u2019t think that his mom is the mean one. A flawed plan, but we do appreciate the good intentions. Another case of good intentions and poor execution? Rafael\u2019s plan to cheer up Jane. See, he\u2019d asked Petra to arrange a meeting with that one book agent (the one that Jane and Petra literally wrestled over), and that meeting is tomorrow! But Jane has no idea of what she\u2019s writing next, so she\u2019s decided to pull some popular market trends and pitch Jeffrey Mullins from there. As it turns out, those trends are reincarnation, vampires, and\u2026 50 Shades Of Grey. None of Jane\u2019s ideas appeal Jeffrey nor the other agent having lunch with him and Jane, Leslie. But something does catch his eye, and that something is Petra, sitting by the bar nearby. He calls for her, either excited to see her or desperate to stop hearing Jane\u2019s frankly terrible pitches, and Leslie turns out to be a fan of Petra\u2019s \u201cmomtrepreneur\u201d image and her tragic backstory. To Jane\u2019s dismay, Leslie suggests that Petra should write a lifestyle book, and Jane can\u2019t do anything but support the idea. But she\u2019s not so supportive once Leslie and Jeffrey have left the Marbella, clearly furious even though she tries to hide it. Petra says that she\u2019ll turn down the book if it\u2019ll get Jane the forgive her, and Jane throws back at her that real relationships aren\u2019t transactional. Faced with the reality that there\u2019s no easy way to buy Jane\u2019s affection back, Petra gets angry and says she\u2019ll write the book. Jane storms off. Compelled to do something nice to convince herself that she doesn\u2019t see all of her relationships as transactional, Petra remembers that Jane Ramos had told her that she couldn\u2019t find treatment for her mother\u2019s Alzheimer, and orders Krishna to get her a place with the area\u2019s top specialist. In the Villanueva household, love and understanding are given without asking for anything in return, something that Petra obviously has never experienced. Sitting on their swing, our favorite women open up about their struggles and get the advice and support they need. Alba confesses that her breakup with Jorge has left her wrecked, because she loved him but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to accept his proposal and now he\u2019s gone back to his ex. Xo admits that running her studio doesn\u2019t make her happy, and gets the encouragement she needs to consider seeking an alternative. And Jane tells them that Mateo has been acting up at school, and that means that the decision of whether to try the romance thing with Rafael or not has become urgent. But Petra does get some support, even if it comes from an unexpected source. While she\u2019s trying and failing to write the damned lifestyle book, Jane Ramos shows up at her apartment, with a gift wine to thank Petra for her help with Jane\u2019s mother, and she ends up joining Petra for drinks. In this surprising intimacy, Petra opens up about her relationship with Jane. She even cries, explaining that Jane is a good person, and the fact that a person as good as Jane is mad at her must mean Petra is a bad person. And, with an earnestness that would be endearing if we didn\u2019t know that she\u2019s conspiring against Petra, Jane Ramos suggests that Petra should go ask for Jane\u2019s forgiveness and not take no for an answer. It\u2019s actually good advice. Petra bullies her way into Jane\u2019s home for Sunday brunch, and manages enough honesty to admit that she considers Jane to be a sort of moral compass, and that she really values her regard and her forgiveness more than Rafael\u2019s. And not only do they make peace, but Jane agrees to ghost-write Petra\u2019s book too! In the good timeline, this would be the beginning of their great romance. But alas, we are not in the good timeline. In reality, the writers insist that Jane doesn\u2019t like women, and so #Jetra is never happening. Instead, Jane talks to Rafael, and though she\u2019s finally come to realize that she might actually be ready for the whole relationship thing, he realized that he\u2019s not in a place for it. Together, chatting like friends on Rafael\u2019s firescape, they come to see that they can\u2019t really explore whether their relationship will work or not, because they simply don\u2019t have the time and the freedom to try and fail when Mateo\u2019s wellbeing is on the line. Is this the end of #Jafael, then? What\u2019s ending for sure is Xo\u2019s dance studio project. She tried, and she tried hard, for three whole years, but she just isn\u2019t making it work. And so, she tells Rogelio, after giving it her best shot and still not finding her place as a studio owner, she\u2019s taking a teaching position in another studio. I think that this is actually good news, as it might mean more scenes of Xiomara dancing, and maybe even a shift back towards her singing dreams. We haven\u2019t seen her sing since the first season! Rogelio, on the other hand, isn\u2019t so excited, but it has little to do with Xo\u2019s announcement. After a whole day of lonely, boring, tiresome babysitting, Rogelio had decided to quit his \u201cstay at home dad\u201d project and go back to acting, but Xo\u2019s speech about how she tried as hard as she could seems to have made him realize just how flakey he was being. Are we about to see some real growth for Ro? Honestly, who the hell knows. Finally, the confirmation. Presenting a united front, Jane and Rafael announce to their family that #Jafael is officially ending, and they\u2019re deciding to remain as just friends. But don\u2019t weep so soon, shippers! This episode has only one final plot twist, and it will make that half of the fandom very happy: the last shot of this chapter is of Jane and Rafael, hidden from their family\u2019s prying eyes by sitting in a car, sharing a passionate kiss! What an episode! Hell, even I, a known #Jadam supporter, am excited for the prospect of Jane and Rafael having a secret romance while their whole family thinks they\u2019re just friends! Those plots are always fun! And Jane Ramos, despite the show\u2019s bad streak with LGB characters, is compelling as hell and has some really good chemistry with Petra. If the original Jane and Petra can\u2019t date, who says this Jane and Petra can\u2019t have some torrid, ultimately doomed romance? I sure would eat that up!

Why it is exciting? It can be compared with the beginning of new life. When You start a new project, You are witnessing the process of development from the initial idea, which appeared in somebody\u2019s head towards the real product, which will be used by millions around the globe. Obviously, this process doesn't just happen by itself, it is moved forward by the team of the project. The team of the project is usually the backbone, which is holding all together and moving it forward until it is fully working and functioning. Can we say, that the most important part of new project is the team? One of the most important parts: yes! There should be initial believe for the idea and strong enthusiasm in every team member: in that case one small group of people can change the world! Akaiito has started to show itself for the world. The team is working with the project for already almost a year. The project is growing, more and more people are joining us on the way. Joining us, cause they believe in the project and want to be a part of the project of the future. Yesterday we got a question regarding the project realization. The main question was: \u201cHow You will make it happen?\u201d Cryptocurrency world is not the easiest field, with a lot of shady sides, with a lot of unclear points, with own new challenges, which nobody has been facing before. Many people has tried to bring cryptocurrency to every day life, many people has this idea in their heads, how we are different, how exactly we can make it happen? The answer is really simple: we truly believe in that project! We want to use cryptocurrency in our every day life and we are sure, that there are so many people in the world, who want the same as we! All together we will make it happen: this is our strongest believe! PS. We have been participating in one big blockchain conference in November and one speaker has asked the question from the audience: \u201cHow many of You is using cryptocurrency in Your every day life? Please, rise Your hand\u201d. There has been around 500 people in the audience and 2 hands has been raised.

Such a long journey, and now it was nearly over. He was almost there, just a few yards from entering the United States\u200a\u2014\u200ahis new country. His heart would have been pounding in anticipation of what lay ahead: a new life of opportunity for him and the family he would send for as soon as he found work and saved a little money. Soon, the misery that had marked their existence back home would be only a faded memory. Just a few more feet. A few more minutes. But it was not to be. Not this time. Not for Jacob Wise and his shipmates, all of whom were about to learn a lesson about the limitations of America\u2019s promise as a land of fresh starts and boundless opportunity. For as it turns out, Jacob\u2019s boat arrived just a few days after the death of William McKinley, the nation\u2019s 25th President, who had been shot eight days prior to that by Leon Czolgosz, the son of Eastern European immigrants. Immigrants, as it happens, from that exact part of Eastern Europe from which Jacob hailed. Caught up in a momentary wave of bigotry against those of his regional heritage, Jacob and the rest would be turned around at the port of entry, denied the right to disembark, and sent back. Back to Russia whence they came. One can easily imagine that as the time ticked by, during the agonizingly slow return to the home he thought he had left for good, Jacob must have wondered if he would ever again get the chance to make right on his promises to his family. He would of course, but it would take several more years. Six to be precise, until he could save up enough money to strike out again, hoping this time to make it past those who had seen themselves fit to exclude anyone who resembled, or sounded like, or were from the same part of the world as Jacob. To illegalize them, if only for a while. And that, as much as anything, provides the most important answer to the question so commonly asked during the current immigration debate. You know the question, voiced with such contempt by those who drip with disdain for the undocumented: \u201cWhat part of illegal do you not understand?\u201d As it turns out, I understand every part of it. I understand it all too well. Its meaning is inscribed on the cell memory of my ancestral line, burned into our familial DNA. For it is the label that was, for a while, placed upon my great grandfather. Not because of anything he had done, but merely because he had been born in a place that, in the eyes of those filled with hatred, rendered him suspect. After all, McKinley was killed by an anarchist whose parents were from modern-day Belarus, and so naturally, it made sense to treat a boat full of Minskers as though they were criminals. Just like today, the occasional crime committed by an undocumented border-crosser from Mexico means we must crack down on others from there, deport as many as possible and prevent the entry of others with a fortified wall. We should, according to the president, view them all (or nearly all) as rapists and drug dealers and treat them accordingly. What I also understand, even better than the meaning of \u201cillegal,\u201d is that racists are not very original. The targets change, but the game remains the same: it is forever and always about stopping the dangerous and \u201cpolluting\u201d other. It is about the dominant group telling those with less power that they are not as good, not as clean, not as moral, not as human in some way. It is about oppressing others in the name of protecting the self, failing to realize that in the end, the oppressor neither fully cows their target nor obtains the security they sought. Indeed they undermine it, along with any remaining pretense to the national greatness that made their own ancestors want to come here to begin with. The degree to which it is ironic is only exceeded by that to which it is pathetic. And yes, I know, the voices that clamor for securing the borders insist they are not racists. But that\u2019s because racist is not all they are. They are also liars. I suspect they insisted on their lack of prejudice a hundred years ago too, even as they were using bogus intelligence tests to \u201cprove\u201d that Jews and Italians were intellectually inferior to \u201creal\u201d white people. There was no bigotry. It was just that certain people were less assimilable, don\u2019t you see? Yes I see. I see very clearly, thank you. The truth is, almost all anti-immigrant hysteria is about race, no matter how loudly and unconvincingly those persons pushing the agenda forward try and deny it. The idea that folks merely want to crack down on those who enter the nation without proper documentation is demonstrably dishonest. After all, if it were merely a matter of wanting people to come the \u201cright way\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200alegally\u200a\u2014\u200athere would be an easy solution: just make legal entry much easier. We could streamline the endeavor and spend just a fraction of the money it would take to build a wall to hire folks who could process immigration applications in an expeditious manner, thereby removing the incentive to jump the so-called line. But no one ever suggests this solution or anything remotely like it. And why? Because the issue really isn\u2019t the distinction between documented and undocumented migrants; it\u2019s about the fact that certain people simply aren\u2019t wanted at all, and certain others feel qualified to make the fine distinctions between the welcomed and the damned. They have always deemed themselves capable of discerning who the better people were and who the lesser, and surely feel confident now that folks from Norway are preferable to those from Haiti, El Salvador or anywhere in Africa. That so many now embrace this kind of thinking is a chilling testament, not merely to how racism works, but how memory itself can let us down and how forgetfulness has been elevated to the level of sacrament. After all, when Donald Trump says Mexico \u201cisn\u2019t sending their best\u201d and his minions roar with approval, the underlying presumption is that Europe, whence he and his cultists come, did. But this is patently false: our ancestors, including my great-grandfather referenced above (and the other three-fourths of my family, which came to the colonies in waves between 150 and 300 years earlier), were all the losers of Europe. The winners never get on the boat. The winners stay put, probably because of all the winning. Funny how that works. But we pretend it isn\u2019t so. As James Baldwin explained in 1963: What passes for identity in America is a series of myths about one\u2019s heroic ancestors. It\u2019s astounding to me, for example, that so many people really seem to believe that the country was founded by a band of heroes who wanted to be free. That happens not to be true. What happened was that some people left Europe because they couldn\u2019t stay there any longer and had to go someplace else to make it. They were hungry, they were poor, they were convicts. It is always the losers who leave. And there is no shame in that. In the leaving one finds an act of resistance, of rebellion, of resilience, an overcoming of obstacles and a willingness to risk everything for a new beginning. But just as there is no shame when the benighted of Europe do it, so too must there be no shame when the destitute of other lands do so. See, black folks know how they got here, and the indigenous of this land are exceedingly clear as to the same. This includes, it should be noted, those Mexican folks, descended at least in part from the indigenous of the Americas who lived in what is now the southwest United States long before anyone ever thought of abandoning London and rebelling against the crown. It is we who are white who have forgotten whence we come and substituted convenient memories in the place of a more troubling history. It is we who choose to ignore how we are bound to those newcomers of today: bound by a commonality of new beginnings, of desperation and terror and longing, however much we ignore it or seek to push it aside. It is we who can glibly yawn or even applaud Donald Trump referring to the entire continent of Africa as a shithole\u200a\u2014\u200aso too Haiti and El Salvador\u200a\u2014\u200aand contrast these places unfavorably with the European nations whence we come, only because we apparently never read Dickens. And because we seem to genuinely believe our ancestors came to this land from advanced functional democracies, with clean fingernails. We have superimposed a noble heritage upon a history of peasantry and poverty, and act as if the latter never happened. We forget that we come from resistance cultures: people who resisted land enclosure, and persecution and enforced starvation at the hands of elites. We forget that our Irish ancestors were virtually enslaved by the Anglo elite, that our Anglo ancestors were marginalized by the same, that our Italian ancestors were disproportionately from Southern Italy and not even considered Italian by their brethren to the North. We are people who were shit on persistently by the elites in our home countries, and as a result, left. No differently than those doing the same today. And yet rather than embracing solidarity with today\u2019s marginalized as a result of that experience, we become the rationalizers, the deniers, the perpetrators of oppression. All in the name of an Americanism that many were once quick to deny us. In our failure to understand our own history we build a wall between ourselves and current migrants that prevents us from acting on the basis of human compassion, the way most would if we could see ourselves in the other. Insofar as we treat newcomers like permanent outsiders, we diminish the value of our own ancestors\u2019 sacrifices, we smash the concept of reciprocity into tiny pieces, and we demonstrate that we barely deserve the new beginnings they made for us, so eager are we to deny them to others.

I thought about how all of these companies are primarily better interfaces into old (sometimes ancient) business models rather than something entirely new, and I tweeted about it. It did not go viral as you can see but I thought it was interesting to consider it. JustEat is a layer over the takeaway business that makes ordering (and re-ordering) a better experience because I do not have to talk to anyone, feel guilty about the amount I am ordering or guess the menu. Their business model is that they take a fee for each order. Trainline is a way to circumvent the god awful experience of booking a train ticket in the UK through a train operating company. It makes it easier to plan journeys, compare prices and keep my ticket on my phone rather than printing 100 pieces of paper to get from Birmingham to Coventry. Again, the business model is that they take a cut. Expedia brings trip planning together so that I make better decisions on flights and accommodation rather than having a few thousand tabs open. The business model? A cut. There\u2019s nothing that innovative about the models of these companies. Yes, they create value, we would not use them otherwise. However, despite their combined valuation of $26,000,000,000 they are merely (and rightly) exploiting the lack of digital capability in cumbersome sectors and performing the role of the platform in exchange for a fee. They are filling the experience vacuum, and the same goes for countless others. What they are doing is what I would describe as front-end innovation. On the other hand, some genuinely world-changing companies have built entirely new business models when you consider the likes of Google, Amazon, and Facebook (over $1,000,000,000,000 combined valuation). It is not a better interface into anything we already know. It is something we did not know we needed until we saw it. You are doing front-end innovation (or FEI as absolutely nobody is calling it) if you are searching for better ways for customers to experience an existing product. Lately, some of the examples of FEI I have been working on with the 383 Project team are: Aside from the fact that they all generate revenue because they are better experiences the commonality is just that. They are better ways to interface with old models. There\u2019s nothing new about getting to the station, connecting to a WiFi network or getting school books and that is fine\u200a\u2014\u200awe are just starting with the customer rather than the proposition. Back-end innovation happens when an innovation team is focused on business R&D as well as solving common customer problems. Some of the BEI programmes the 383 gang have been working on for example are: These are all about developing the radically new. They are the kind of propositions that might initially take customers by surprise. Rather than starting with customer problems, they are beginning with customer jobs to be done, going away and figuring out entirely unfamiliar ways to get those jobs done with a wholly new product rather than a better route into an existing product. One of these is not better than the other. The important thing is to have a balance of both focusing on solving customer problems as well as concentrating on inventing new propositions to test with them. Some companies are doing neither; some are doing one, and the best are doing both. I wish established companies were doing more of both (or any!) and capturing the value from better experiences and better business models. The idea that supermarket companies are not doing front-end innovation to challenge the likes of Hello Fresh is bonkers. The notion that banks are not doing back-end innovation and fundamentally changing business models is also nuts (maybe they secretly are).

After months of work, the two publishers backing him collapsed. The work itself, an investigation of the oil industry, disappeared briefly from amazon.com, its primary retail outlet. Even when the story mysteriously reappeared on the virtual shelves, and became an unlikely best-seller, Horwitz says he barely made any money. Horwitz\u2019s insider experience merited a public airing in the Times in part because it deflated one of digital media\u2019s most hope-filled balloons. The advent of mobile technology has led many writers and readers to believe that small screens in our pockets can provide a home for a beloved form once called just nonfiction, then \u201cliterary journalism,\u201d and more recently \u201clongform.\u201d Narratives can have staying power beyond the usual churn of daily news, and many writers working now, myself included, came up admiring these carefully-honed, meticulously-reported stories: Slouching Toward Bethlehem, The Soccer War, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Joe Gould\u2019s Secret. The problem is that stories like those, or Boom, can be as expensive to produce as they are exhilarating to research, write, and read. Horwitz\u2019s experience led him to question whether people actually want them as much as we all say we do. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many people willing to pay even $2.99 to read at length about a trek through the oil patch, no matter how much I sexed it up with cowboys and strippers,\u201d he wrote. The traditional places to read these stories are taking a beating of their own. About two weeks ago the media industry news website Capitol New York reported a rare all-hands meeting at the New Yorker magazine. According to the Capitol New York report, income from selling advertising has fallen ten percent at the New Yorker since the last year, while the audience for its famous journalism grew by a rampant 15%. Assuming those numbers are accurate, they describe a basic structural problem that drives successful writers like Horwitz to experiment with new outlets for serious work like Boom. Industry-wide, audiences are growing while budgets are falling, and writers bear the brunt of this faltering business model. We\u2019re the ones asked to do more professional-quality reporting, faster, to reach expanding audiences, even as the budgets to produce that work shrink. Earlier this month, as part of a group of nine experienced writers, I helped to launch Deca, a cooperative founded to create precisely the kind of stories Horwitz\u2019s experience cautions against. Writers themselves have become the driving force behind many of the efforts to seek solutions, and Deca is no different. We\u2019re keenly aware of the work that goes in to creating these stories. We\u2019re directly affected by any drop in the value the market places on them\u200a\u2014\u200aand it couldn\u2019t get much lower. A magazine story pays about $2/word today, which is about the same as it did in the late 1990s. It makes sense that we would be the ones searching most urgently for models that bring wages in line with the times. We\u2019ve seen this happen before. When the recording industry faltered in the face of digital distribution, it was the musicians themselves who responded fastest and most creatively. When digitization came to professional photography, several groups of photojournalists responded by leaving longstanding relationships with large agencies to form collectives, notably Noor and VII. One could go as far back as Magnum. Deca is unusual in its shared financial structure and its focus on stories from abroad. But it\u2019s isn\u2019t the only bottom-up project trying to crack this problem: producing work that readers find appealing and accessible, while also being viable for writers. The largest, Horwitz\u2019s publisher Byliner, appears to be facing hard choices. It has angered many writers for promising a break from traditional publishing models, then mimicking some of the least appealing parts of those old models. They paid lower royalties to their authors than Amazon itself would, and they pushed many writers to sign away some of their ownership of the material, undercutting one of the major advantages of self- publishing. Still, credit to them: they took a shot at it. Epic, which publishes digital long form, focuses on arranging Hollywood movie deals for its writers. They have to do that because major magazine publishers, with ad revenue in free fall, have moved to take more and more of those rights from authors. The Atavist, which started as a small group of editors maxing out their credit cards, has become a pioneer in multimedia. Efforts like The Big Roundtable and Beacon are experimenting with funding models to let readers directly pay for writers to investigate stories. All of these projects resulted from the initiative of writers. Not from publishers. Not by magazines with staff available for research and development, and budgets for which an experiment like Deca would amount to a rounding error. Publishers\u2019 efforts have so far been desultory, unfortunately, and our resources come instead from our own pockets and a Kickstarter effort, which continues. While we can\u2019t speak to other projects\u2019 motivations, Deca in large part exists because writers recognized a need to adapt, innovate, and confront the change that\u2019s clearly upon us, and found it necessary to take it upon ourselves. Nor is this without recent precedent. At Deca, we\u2019re collaborating along the same lines musicians did as the recording industry collapsed, and photographers did as photojournalism went digital, shouldering some of the risk for one another. Deca produces one story in digital format each month. One of us writes the story and the rest provide editorial, promotional and administrative support. The next month, it\u2019s someone else\u2019s turn to have his or her project brought to publication. We share some costs and income from the overall group sales. We sell single stories as well as subscriptions available through an app, which we will debut next month. Yet a question remains: Why has it been the writers, the photographers and the musicians themselves taking these risks? That\u2019s what we\u2019d love to debate. But that won\u2019t happen until large publishers face the current realities. Until then, writers are all paying close attention as the data on this new era trickles in. Writing in Pando Daily over the weekend, Paul Carr, a founder of the digital magazine NSFWCorp, said he had done well with a story published through Byliner, the same digital publisher Horwitz says did poorly by him. Carr\u2019s story attempted to shift the debate from whether digital formats have a future, to whether a particular deal with a particular publisher is enough evidence on which to base conclusions about the form. Carr claims he made about $10,000 on his own story about his recovery from alcoholism, and continues to receive royalties. That\u2019s not bad. Tony Horwitz also took that chance alone, whether he knew he was doing so or not. He went into the lab and experimented. It blew up in his face. Without existing institutions helping, you get cases like that. There will be more. It wasn\u2019t his fault, but it also wasn\u2019t his failed publishers\u2019 fault, at bottom. It was the industry as a whole, which has decided to face a once-in-500-years technological shift as a problem for someone else to solve. For now, that means the writers are the someone else. It\u2019s surprising more of us don\u2019t tell stories like Tony\u2019s. It\u2019s encouraging so many of us are trying to figure it out anyway, and, so far, doing pretty well.

This applies to the successful creative director, the struggling Wordpress theme designer and the intern no one really cares about. Now before I dive in my thoughts about criticism, I want to make the following point: there are not a lot of people who have an active interest in visuals and aesthetics. This happens because not everyone is high in trait Openness (one of the Big 5 Personality traits), which manifests in interest in ideas and art, particularly visual art. The lack of interest in aesthetics means lack of interest in taking the time and putting in the effort to develop good taste, which is something you have to develop especially if you want to become a designer. Good taste is created deliberately, after years of practice, taking you from someone who doesn\u2019t know how to spot a giant mistake in a logo to someone who can create beautiful visual concepts in a few minutes. This means that if you are not high in trait Openness, there is a low chance that you will take the time to develop good taste. (Which is not a binary thing; there are plenty of people low in trait Openness who have good taste because they developed it on the side.) With this in mind, it is safe to assume that lots of people who don\u2019t have any interest in visuals don\u2019t have good taste, not because there is something wrong with them, but because they never took the time to develop it. By association, we need to establish whether or not the criticism of certain groups of people matters for a designer. Designers need to develop the good taste to advance in their craft, which means not only the effort needed to be put in but also the association they have to make with people whose sophisticated critique will improve their process and in turn, their craft. We barely scratched the surface when we said that most people low in trait Openness don\u2019t possess interest in developing good taste in aesthetics; however, this doesn\u2019t mean the complete dismissal of their opinions because good taste is not all when it comes to prerequisites of people whose critique matters for a designer. This leads me to make another two important points: 1) Designers need to train themselves to dismiss the opinions of people whose criticism doesn\u2019t matter, and yes, this means both positive and negative opinions. This requires the humility to not invest their egos in the opinions of those who cannot help them in advancing professionally. In layman\u2019s terms, know that you are not your work and when someone criticizes your work, it\u2019s the work itself being criticized not you as a person. 2) Notice my words: when a particular group\u2019s opinion on a designer\u2019s piece of work matters, it\u2019s called critique; when it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s called criticism. It\u2019s important from now on to cover the following topics: what criticism is, what critique is, what are the prerequisites that make a group of people capable of giving critique and finally, who and where are that gropus of people. In my understanding, criticism is a biased opinion that conveys judgment and lacks context. Criticism can be delivered both in terms of mild but useless observation (\u201cI don\u2019t like that black\u201d, \u201cYou are really good\u201d) or butt-hurt, soul-sucking assertions that have as a purpose hurting someone\u2019s feelings (\u201cWhat is this ugly thing?\u201d). Of course, something that can resemble a critique but is still a criticism is an entitled opinion about the good aspects of a particular piece of design. Imagine this scenario: you present your work to an art director who doesn\u2019t ask you any questions but proceeds in elevating your ego by highlighting what he thinks is good: \u201cI really like how you mixed these two colors\u201d. This is useless. It doesn\u2019t help you professionally, it only puts the art director in the position of making you a compliment that you will never be able to use in the real world. And this is where the difference between criticism and critique emerges: Critique means questions, criticism means opinion, and because individual opinion lacks the apriori defined context that comes with an understanding of both the craft and the particular solved problem, it is safe to say it lacks any meaning. Ergo, criticism, in general, is meaningless. Your work will not expand and flourish based on biased opinions, which is why it\u2019s necessary to find out if someone can give you an unbiased opinion. And I say this because you cannot stop people to express their opinions (nor it is recommended), but you can stop listening to ideas and judgments that lack coherence and professionalism. Here is a (probably incomplete) list of items I think should be in order for someone before you listen to him/ her: \u2022 Good taste (covered before), which should be determined by the level of interest someone has in aesthetics and coherence of opinion. An Android developer can have good taste even if he doesn\u2019t work in the visual field; it\u2019s not the occupation that defines it, but the level of interest. \u2022 Complete understanding of the problem the designer was trying to solve. \u2022 Complete understanding of why art and design matters, which is essential to trim the people who only want to drag you down or get work for free. \u2022 Your own, personal, complete understanding of your professional level and the problem you were trying to solve, because if you lack this, you will go and fish for compliments that, as I said before, lack any meaning. All this are, in my estimation, essential. You invite someone to give you a critique but one of the above is missing, and you only waste your time. So the question is: who and where are those who embody the above items, and the most in-your-face answer is this: Find mentors who are way above you in the competence hierarchy, do stuff for them and invite them to give you critique. Use reciprocity to form a professional relationship with people who are better than you and take anything you can from them while they take anything they can from you. These people might be art directors, creative directors, more experienced work and school colleagues, well-versed entrepreneurs, good practitioners who want to dedicate their time in educating the youth, executive producers, smart managers, etc. Search for these people deliberately; honestly, if you care to look, they are everywhere, and most of them are eager to form a connection and help somebody else become a great designer to work with.

I am so thankful to all of awesome people that joined me on this journey and my wife who encouraged me pursue my dream! Along the way, I learned a few very valuable lessons that I would like to share. Some lessons I had to learn the hard way, but others could have been avoided had I been less stubborn and listened to the experiences shared by entrepreneurs in the past. RewardMob has been the most challenging startup that I have ever taken part in, but it has also been the most fun and an incredibly rewarding personal experience. A little background first! I am not the technical guy in the operation. I do believe, however, that it is important to surround yourself with experts. What is RewardMob? RewardMob is a tournament based reward platform for mobile games. We can turn any mobile game into a free casual eSport where players compete in tournaments for cash and prizes. Two years ago, the concept was very different and a lot less polished. When I first came up with the original idea, I bounced it around with some of my friends and they all thought it sounded pretty cool! I decided I would build it, how hard could it be! I contacted a few local development studios and was blown away by the cost. I thought I would outsmart them and do it myself by hiring an off shore development team in India. We negotiated a price that could be paid weekly and we were on our way. Outsourcing seemed perfect! After the first 3 months of working very early mornings and very late nights, I realised that outsourcing wasn\u2019t all it was cracked up to be. At this point, I was still running my other business which was very demanding and I was starting to get burnt out! Maybe all of the books and articles that I read were right! You really do need a technical co-founder to in order to run a successful tech start up! Thankfully I listened. Lesson 1\u200a\u2014\u200aIf you are a non-technical co-founder: YOU NEED A TECHNICAL CO-FOUNDER! I met with 9 different developers from various backgrounds and I thought I had finally found my guy. He had just exited a successful start up and was sitting on a nice chunk of cash! I just killed two birds with one stone! This almost seamed too good to be true. We started working together, formed a new company, and we were ready to roll. However, he came to me one day shortly after and said he had some serious personal issues and we could no longer work together. This meant I was now stuck with the legal bills from creating the company and had also wasted two months of effort trying to structure everything properly so we were both happy. It took me a week to regroup, but I decided the idea was too great to turn back now. I started searching again for the elusive technical co-founder. On the bright side, I had my expert off-shore team on the job, so everything would be just fine! Lesson 2\u200a\u2014\u200aYou are going to hit walls. Lots of them. View each one as an opportunity to improve. Every time we hit a wall it made us stronger. If it wasn\u2019t for my bad math skills, we wouldn\u2019t be in the place we are today. Inside joke for another post. Out of the blue one day, I got a call from a proper sounding English guy asking if I was still looking for a Technical Co-Founder. He sounded pretty cool, so I asked him to come in for an interview. I met Colin and we instantly hit it off. On top of being an easy guy to get along with, he had a very impressive background and was working at a job that wasn\u2019t satisfying his creative juices or his bank account. Little did he know at the time, start ups don\u2019t exactly come flush with cash. However, we decided to join forces and he started working part time on the project with me. I was very proud to let Colin know that the project was well on its way and, with a little guidance on his part, our top team of out-sourcing professionals would have our app out the door in no time! Obviously, the first thing Colin did was take a look at the code and database structures that had been built. Before the end of the day, he came to me with some grim news: I was the proud owner of a pig with lipstick. No matter how pretty you dress it up, it\u2019s still a pig. The result turned out to be total garbage\u200a\u2014\u200afull of security vulnerabilities, slow and non-scalable. We tried to salvage what we had, but we soon decided it was better to scrap the entire thing and start from scratch. Yep! All that time and money wasted and all because I didn\u2019t find my Technical Co-Founder first! Lesson 3\u200a\u2014\u200aNo matter how good of an idea outsourcing seems, refer to lesson number 1. Not long after we fired our outsourcing team, Colin called me and said \u201cI quit.\u201d My heart literally stopped. I thought \u201coh my God, not again.\u201d After a brief pause, I said \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d \u201cNo, Mate. I can\u2019t handle it anymore. So, I quit my job today so we can do this full time.\u201d For a brief second, it seemed like the end of the world! However, it turned out to be the most important decision Colin made, as it was that day that he took a leap of faith. After that, we went out and raised enough money to get things off the ground. We hired a full-time front-end developer and started building again in-house. The way it should be done! Lesson 4\u200a\u2014\u200aThe leap of faith. At some point, you just have to go for it. Nothing is more motivational for two guys in their 40\u2019s with families to feed, than not having a safety net anymore. By now, we had our new plan all figured out! Our app had every bell and whistle imaginable and we were going to conquer the world. Then we launched the app and learned an entirely new lesson. Lesson 5\u200a\u2014\u200aUntil you test your project, everything you thought was correct is just an assumption. Your clients/users are the only people that will be able to tell you if your assumptions are correct or not. You have probably heard of MVP or Minimum Viable Product before. That\u2019s not just a suggestion. You need to build the absolute minimum working prototype and test it as soon as possible. Continue to iterate and test over and over again. If the results are favorable, continue to develop. If not, then cut your losses quickly. From our first launch, we realised we had two problems: Our original branding didn\u2019t work and we really didn\u2019t understand what our users wanted. In early 2017, we re-branded to RewardMob and created a new core loop. After several months of successful testing, we launched our app on the Appstore and Google Playstore in August. We have now given out over $17,000 dollars in cash and prizes and the company has grown to seven Employees. We are running tournaments weekly and working on adding more new games every week. I hope my article inspires you in some way to follow your dreams in your quest to achieve success, but first\u200a\u2014\u200afind yourself a Technical Co-Founder!

It removes any doubts and assumptions. The informed decisions are made using the information we get from the research. The team can fix any usability issues it has or will have in the future. The main focus of any product team is to deliver a product (whether digital or physical) which is: 1. Easy to use 2. Customer first 3. Features which the users will be able to use Role of User Researcher The role of the User Researchers is to take notes, learn about the audiences, understand their problem, what they prefer and iteratively test it throughout the design process. There are many way user research methods can be used to gather information. The user research methods are divided into 3 categories based on the 3-dimensional framework. Those are: 1. Attitudinal and Behavioral 2. Qualitative and Quantitative 3. Generative and Evaluative (or Context of use) 1. Attitudinal and Behavioral This kind of research is related to how a user feels towards a product or service. What is their attitude/emotion when interacting with it. The opinion of the user when creating a product or service matters. The main purpose of the attitudinal research is to understand the participant\u2019s thinking. This kind of research is done using focus groups, surveys. Behavioral research is more focused on what users do with the product or service. It is about providing the data about how the user interacts with the product or service. It answers questions like where the user clicks first when he goes to a website or what choices do they take when using a product. A/B testing, eye-tracking are few of the methods that researchers can use to determine this type of research. 2. Quantitative and Qualitative Quantitative research is any research related to numbers (that is which can be measured). Any research which can be counted like \u201chow many users\u201d, \u201chow much the users spend their time\u201d, etc. It hence, quantifies how the user thinks, behaves, his opinions and any other variables. Based on the quantitative results, designers formulate facts and uncover patterns. The research can be done using surveys (online, paper, digital), user interviews, analytics, polls etc. It answers \u201chow many\u201d, \u201chow much\u201d Whereas Qualitative research is to understand \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow to\u201d. They answer questions like \u201cwhy the user clicked here\u201d, \u201cwhy they did not spend time here\u201d. It helps designers understand why people do things like they do instead of what they say. It involves engaging users and understanding their behavior, attitudes, feelings, and emotions. This type of research can be done using focus groups, one-on-one interviews, and observations. 3. Context of Use This research depends whether the user is actually using the product or not. It is further divided into 4 categories which are: Natural: This study is done to understand user\u2019s natural behavior towards a product. Scripted: Participants are given certain parameters to focus on a specific feature or a redesign. Depending on the type of study, the script can differ. Not using the product: Study is done when the product is not used by the user to understand how they will react when using it for the first time. Hybrid: It is a combination different context of product use. Like, participants can interact with the product\u2019s design elements and maybe propose a solution or a new feature which will benefit them. Basic User Research Methods Interviews: Talking to participants and asking the right questions is very important. It helps designers understand the user their problems, thoughts, and feelings towards a product. Surveys: It is a great way to gain insights into what users prefer, their opinions, behavior or realistic information depending on the purpose the research. Tools such as Survey Monkey, Google Forms, Typeform. Focus Groups: It is a popular method to better understand the motivations of users and their perception of the product with a demographically diverse group of 3\u201310 people. It is done through interviews in which a group of people are asked about their opinions, beliefs, and attitudes towards a product. better understand the motivations of users and their perception of the product. Eye tracking: This method is used to measure where the participants are looking while using a product using point of gaze or the motion of an eye. Heat Mapping: It is a visual mapping of the data to show how the user has clicked or scrolled. Heatmaps are often used to show what percentage of people interacted with different parts of the product. The most-used parts of the page are often displayed with dark red, the less viewed part is usually displayed in green. Participatory Design: In this method participants are usually all stakeholders (like Product Owners, Partners, customers) who actively take part in the design process to help ensure the result meets their needs. They are given design elements to create their own experience and are asked to explain why and how. A/B Testing: It is also called bucket tests or split-run testing. Different designs (usually 2 options) are randomly tested with equal number participants to determine which one performs better. Tools such as Optimizely, Visual Website Optimizer Usability Testing: This method involves testing of design by giving the user set of tasks and performing them in front of the researcher. It focuses on measuring a product\u2019s capacity to meet its intended purpose. Tools like WhatUsersDo, Usabilla Ethnographic Studies: This research is done to study the participants in their natural environment where they will be using the product the most. Analytics: Data is gathered from the website and mobile app. This helps researchers and designers understand the user, number of page views, demographics before they drop-off. Tools like Google Analytics, HotJar, Kissmetrics When is User Research applied? User research can be done at any phase of the project. Depending on what phase of the project you are in, different type user research can be used. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out. Partner at Idea Theorem.

I understand. His wife won\u2019t let him have his late-night bowls of mint chocolate chip ice cream anymore and she nags him about the Sunday afternoons he spends watching golf on television. I frown. His doctor says he needs more vitamin D, and maybe he should consider anti-depressants, too, but he\u2019s sure if he could just find something meaningful to do with his life, he would feel better. I make a little tsk-ing noise, widen my eyes. I am close to crying. I tell him he\u2019s sweet for caring about his son so much. I tell him if I were with him, I would let him eat all the ice cream he wanted, and Sunday afternoons would be set aside for watching golf, because why shouldn\u2019t people do what makes them happy? Then I tell him I don\u2019t know about vitamin D and anti-depressants (that\u2019s the truest thing I\u2019ll say all week), but he seems very healthy and, as I say this, I gently touch his thigh and dip my head a little and look at him so my eyes are half hidden\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019ve practiced in the mirror. I smile without showing my teeth\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019ve practiced that, too\u200a\u2014\u200aand wait for him to reach for me. But he\u2019s not ready for that; he wants to tell me about how he hit a triple for his softball team last weekend, how it was \u201cmagical,\u201d how he wishes he could feel that good all the time. I\u2019ve had men like him before, and they\u2019re sweet, but they can be tricky, too. I don\u2019t know what a triple is, and I have no idea what it has to do with magic, but I do know we\u2019ve been talking for 15 minutes. I know it\u2019s important that he feel like we have all day, that we have forever. Time can\u2019t exist for us. But I know exactly how much time we do have. I kick off my shoes (simple, beige $600 Louboutins that I got on sale for $250) that I wore specially for him because he told me he\u2019s \u201cnot a fancy guy.\u201d (If he were fancy, I\u2019d wear my black Louboutins.) He\u2019s still talking about triples and magic and meaning. We have 35 minutes. It\u2019s plenty of time, but I don\u2019t want to take any unnecessary risks. My job is all about minimizing risk. I move closer, tell him I have an idea that would make him feel good. I tell him it would make me feel good, too. I tell him I\u2019ve been thinking about it since he texted me two days ago. I gently claw his thigh with my fresh, red (any other color, you\u2019re taking a risk) manicure. I moisten my lips, flash just a little tooth. He\u2019s shy, but he\u2019s a man. He stops talking. The tricky part of my job is over. Now it\u2019s time for sex. I arrived in New York City from Chelyabinsk, a city right in the middle of Russia, when I was 19 years old, with $300 in my pocket. I turned 24 in March and have managed to save $200,000, by fucking for money. I\u2019ve traveled to Morocco, Paris, Beijing, and Monaco. Men have brought me tea from London, chocolates from Switzerland, lingerie from France and shoes from Italy. I\u2019ve bought my parents a little village house. (I told them I had a rich American boyfriend who was taking care of me.) I don\u2019t hate men. I am not a victim of child trafficking. I have never been raped, or drugged, or done porn. I\u2019m not an addict. I never had a pimp. I don\u2019t suffer from what my American girlfriends call \u201cdaddy issues\u201d and what my shrink refers to as \u201cmalformed identity centering on early childhood abandonment.\u201d My dad had lovers. I don\u2019t blame my parents for my job, or my life. Other kids have other problems. My parents had problems when they were kids. My therapist has helped me see that. I\u2019m a businesswoman. I did what politicians in this country are always encouraging immigrants to do. Work hard, seize opportunity, maximize your talents, and adjust and adapt to the new world economy. I haven\u2019t worked as an escort for over a year. Not because the job was illegal, though that\u2019s part of it. And not because I sometimes had to deal with idiots, though that was part of it, too. I got out because I want to study filmmaking, and psychology, and I can afford to do that now. I got out because eventually I\u2019d like to get married and have a kid, and the longer I escorted, the trickier that would get. My life since I quit has been sort of complicated, and I\u2019ll tell you about that. But first I\u2019ll tell you how I got into the business, and what it was like. I grew up in central Russia. When I was little, I wanted to be a tour guide and see the world. Then a tour bus came through our town and it was small and stinky with no air conditioning. The tour guide had frizzy hair and sweat stains under her arms. I thought tour guides in the United States probably had it better. I had the phone number of a Russian woman who had said she would host me. When I arrived at JFK, she told me to take the train to Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. I knew about it because in Russian movies it\u2019s a place where you can buy smoked salmon and caviar and nice clothes, and where only people who really achieve can go. I felt lucky. When I came out of the train station I saw all these ugly people, people in wheelchairs, old people, and the streets were smelly and the people were wearing clothes worse than what people wore in the Soviet Union and the train station was loud and I thought: Fuck, this is not the America that I heard of. I spent four days there before I met a girl who said I could live with her in Manhattan. When I got there and looked around, I understood the fuss. I understood why all people want to come here. I applied for jobs at restaurants and medical offices, but no one would hire me. I saw an ad for dancers and called. They picked me up in a truck filled with other young girls. There were a lot of drunken men at the club, trying to touch different parts of my body. I made $300 and decided I would never do that again. I answered another ad, to work in a Turkish caf\u00e9. The owner said, you don\u2019t have to work: If you just let me fuck you, I\u2019ll pay you. No thank you, I said. Actually, it was more like, fuck off, you stupid dude. I\u2019d been in New York two weeks, but I was getting better at English. Then I saw an ad about massage. It said I didn\u2019t need experience and I could make up to $500 a day. I stood in a room with another girl and when the guy came in and got undressed, I did what the other girl did, and rubbed his back and his legs. Then after 30 minutes the other girl got undressed, and I realized, \u201cOh, this is why I\u2019m getting $100 an hour.\u201d So I got undressed and we jerked him off. I started working five days a week. After two months, the spa told me I couldn\u2019t work there anymore. I don\u2019t know if it was because they were mad because I had been seeing private clients, or they just wanted to keep getting new girls. The other girl from the spa and I decided to rent an apartment and to work on our own. We pooled our savings and bought a massage table and a bed and we started advertising on Backpage.com. We were making about $800 a day each. Most of the guys wanted more than a massage, which is what they all called a hand job, and they offered to pay more. I\u2019m not sure what my friend did, but I always said no. One of my regulars, he would come for a massage three times a week, and always give me nice tips, sometimes $100. He asked about my life in Russia and told me I might feel better if I talked to a psychologist. He gave me the number of one he\u2019d heard of, who spoke Russian, and extra money to pay for a few months to talk to her. And he offered me $1,000 an hour to have sex with him. It was tempting, but I thought that if I ever fucked for money, I would never respect myself again. He told me he liked me just the way I was. He told me he would like to help me get into school, to take care of me. He told me I would be a great psychologist, because I made people feel comfortable. So when he invited me to the Plaza Hotel one night, I went. He had an expensive suite with great views, opened a bottle of expensive champagne, and we started to talk. We talked for a while and then we got undressed and had sex. He gave me an envelope with $1,000, but he said it wasn\u2019t payment; it was just because he liked me so much. He had to leave the next morning for a business trip to Chicago, but I stayed in the suite and ordered room service\u200a\u2014\u200aorange juice and a big fluffy omelet with mushrooms and beautiful golden toast and little pats of butter shaped like sea shells. I was so happy. I felt like Vivian from Pretty Woman. He didn\u2019t call me when he got back from Chicago. I called him, but he didn\u2019t answer, so I called him at work. His secretary told me he was \u201cnot available.\u201d She told me he would not be available, ever. I opened my eyes that day. Clients knew me as Angelina or Anna. Angelina was \u201csweet, intelligent, fun and playful\u2026 a devoted pleasure seeker who takes enjoying life very seriously indeed.\u201d Anna was more shy, a \u201cEuropean companion who adores luxury travel\u2026 often passionate, sometimes hilarious but rarely forgettable.\u201d Angelina cost $800 an hour, $4,000 for the night; Anna ran $900 and $5,000. According to rankings in The Erotic Review (TER), the Yelp of the commercial sex world, each rated in the top 1 percent of all escorts. But there are lots of young, pretty girls in my business. What got me to the top\u200a\u2014\u200aand what kept me there\u200a\u2014\u200awas my work ethic and attention to detail. I was successful because I learned some hard, valuable lessons about making it in the sex-for-money business. Here are some of them: I paid someone to write my ad copy. I paid professional photographers $1,500 to shoot my pictures. I considered those investments in myself. The best page for escorts, Eros.com, costs $400 a month to place an ad. They charge the most, and they attract the most serious escorts and guys who are willing to submit to screening. Backpage is more wide open, and it gets cheaper guys, as well as scary, freaky guys. Craigslist is barely worth mentioning. That\u2019s where people get killed. I spent $50 a day on Eros so I could be listed in the \u201cWhat\u2019s New\u201d section, and I learned that to have an impact I had to be \u201cnew\u201d for at least 20 days a month. I spent $500 a week for a \u201cfeatured\u201d spot. So that\u2019s almost $4,000 a month right there. The girls who would only spend the basic $400 a month, they\u2019d only get one email in two weeks. They\u2019d be sitting at home, sucking their fingers. Then there\u2019s rent, because you want a separate apartment to do your work, because you can\u2019t worry about roommates, and that costs at least $3,000 in Manhattan. You can rent a cheaper place in the Bronx, or Queens, sure, but you think guys with money are going to come see you there? In my first ads, I used very little copy. What was the point? What I know now is that guys want to know the women they\u2019re fucking. It surprised me, but a lot of them\u200a\u2014\u200amost of them\u200a\u2014\u200areally need to feel a sort of connection. Reading about Angelina\u2019s easy laugh, or how Anna loves luxury travel, made them more comfortable. And when they\u2019re more comfortable, they call. I always wondered why Playboy ran those little interviews with the girls alongside the photos. Now I know. The guys who are jerking off want to feel like they know the girl. Anna and Angelina were exotic and vaguely foreign-sounding without any specific nationality. Men here\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially American men\u200a\u2014\u200ahave certain ideas about certain nationalities. If you\u2019re a South American girl, then you\u2019re wild, you\u2019re fun, and you love to fuck. If you\u2019re Asian, you\u2019re bad! You\u2019re freaky, and you\u2019ll do anything, and you\u2019ll want to do more! American men think Russians are hot, but also icy and mean. Some of the guys have had some not-so-good experiences with what I learned they call Russian gold diggers. American girls are seen as being in really good shape and put-together, and open-minded and fun. Sometimes they have cute ponytails and big smiles, but guys think they\u2019re sort of selfish and bitchy, too. Once I learned all that, I decided that Angelina and Anna would be beautiful and mysterious, cosmopolitan, but no one would be able to tell from their names what part of the world they were from. They wouldn\u2019t give a client any reason to rule them out based on stereotypes. It\u2019s just smart business. These days, guys can fuck porn stars for $2,000\u200a\u2014\u200aand they advertise on the same sites I do. They can hire \u201csugar babies\u201d for $4,000 a month. There are even \u201csex vacations\u201d for $2,000 where you get food and lodging thrown in along with the sex. So if you want to make money as an escort, you better deliver something special. I did couples. I offered toys, role-playing, and BDSM. (I didn\u2019t do anal and I didn\u2019t even know what it was until one of my clients asked about it, then explained it. At first I thought he was joking and I think I hurt his feelings a little when I laughed. If I ever were to do anal, I would charge at least $1,500 for it, mostly because what I learned is that guys think it\u2019s so forbidden and are so shy about asking for it and that they think most girls don\u2019t really like it). Mostly, I offered understanding. The truth is, even for guys who hire me for three or four hours, the sex usually only takes about 15 minutes. It\u2019s the understanding they\u2019re buying. White girls can charge the most, at least in New York. Then Spanish girls, then Asians (Koreans and Japanese tend to demand more than Chinese), then black girls. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s supply and demand or what, but one of my clients, a handsome blonde actor, he told me to take advantage. He told me he\u2019d been up for 10 commercials in the past five months, and hadn\u2019t gotten a single one. He said it was because the marketplace wanted brunettes now, because of the increasing Latino population and their buying power. (I often learn business tips from my customers, even when they don\u2019t know it.) In any case, I took advantage. I charged top dollar. What amazes me is some of the American girls who only charge $400. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because they\u2019re stupid, or too lazy to study the competition, or they\u2019re not as serious about their work. Maybe it\u2019s because they never stepped on a stinky tourist bus with no air conditioning. With an agency, they screen your clients. They set up your appointments. They take care of you. What they also take is your money. For massage parlors, it\u2019s half. For escort agencies, it\u2019s 30 to 40 percent. Girls who work at the agencies don\u2019t want to deal with owning their own businesses. To me, that\u2019s shortsighted. First off, the ones that advertise 20 girls usually have two, one blonde and one brunette. So, of course, those girls are working hard. Really hard. If an agency gets 20 clients a day, each of those girls is fucking 10 guys\u200a\u2014\u200aa day. At the end of a summer, they have $50,000, but they had to fuck a lot of guys for that. To me, that\u2019s not worth it. It\u2019s not cost-effective. I worked hard, but once I went into business for myself, I worked hard for myself, not someone else. It\u2019s the entrepreneurs who get rich. I\u2019m 5'7\", 119 pounds, with long legs, hazel eyes, full lips, and a slim body that has been getting attention since I entered puberty. That\u2019s the raw material. It\u2019s my product, so I took care of it. I\u2019m a vegetarian and I have a personal trainer. I got manicures and pedicures at least twice a week, always red, and always showed up in expensive lingerie and thigh-high stockings. Every time I met a client it was a performance, so I prepared. My mascara cost $130. Hair color was $200; eye shadow was $50, as was foundation and lipstick. A nice lingerie set costs at least $100; I spent $600. Not to mention the shoes. In real life, girls prepare in the same way, then the guy takes her to a diner, or he says, \u201cLet\u2019s go to a sports bar and we can drink bottles of beer.\u201d What a schmuck. No wonder so many guys complain about not getting laid. My dates gave me flowers, Prada coats, iPhones. They did not take me to diners, or sports bars. When a guy meets an escort, he wants to be nice, he wants to prove he\u2019s the best, he wants to be great. And then in real life, he can be so stupid. Last Valentine\u2019s Day, I was in a McDonald\u2019s near my apartment. Valentine\u2019s and Christmas and Easter are never big days in my business, at least with the guys who have money. I came there to drink some Coca-Cola and because the internet worked faster than in my apartment. I had bought myself flowers, daisies and violets. There was a couple sitting next to me and the girl said, \u201cOMG, how cute are your flowers?\u201d I was in a pretty good mood and I said to the guy, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to buy your girlfriend flowers,\u201d and he said, \u201cShe\u2019s okay without them.\u201d I\u2019m not sure why, but that made me so mad. \u201cFuck you!\u201d I said to the guy, and I left. The big part of my job started at the door. You don\u2019t pay attention to the envelope he has. You pretend it doesn\u2019t even exist. You\u2019re smiling because he\u2019s a handsome man, and there\u2019s chemistry. If he\u2019s shy, you offer him a glass of wine. If he\u2019s super shy, you ask, can you massage him, there\u2019s nothing wrong with a massage, right? Sometimes I would say, \u201cOh, you\u2019re so handsome,\u201d because people like to be flattered, even if it\u2019s not true. People like to believe the better things, because believing better things is easier. And guys who are paying $1,000 an hour really believe the better things! If he can afford $1,000 an hour, he already thinks he\u2019s cool. When a guy\u2019s got money, he thinks he\u2019s cool, cooler than regular people. They all wanted you to come, and they wanted you to come more than once. The 60-year-old guy who wants me to come five times before he has an orgasm believes it\u2019s because he cares about me. But it\u2019s because he wants to prove to himself that he can still make a young girl come. (I told lies for a living, but the biggest lies in the world are the lies people tell themselves.) So of course I pretended to come. And I learned that the best, most convincing, easiest way to show my clients I had an orgasm was just to say, \u201cI just came.\u201d That\u2019s it. Nothing fancy. I\u2019m not that good an actress, and it\u2019s not necessary, anyway. \u201cOh, I came\u201d would always do the trick. They believed it. They were so proud. The truth is, for most girls, you can\u2019t tell: It\u2019s like God, or love, you don\u2019t see it, but you believe it exists. As important as it was for me to do, and say, certain things, equally important was what not to do and say. I didn\u2019t ask about the guy\u2019s family. Not because it was crossing any boundaries (you\u2019d be surprised at how many men brag about their kids) but because what if someone had just died? That would make him sad. I never, ever wanted to make a client sad. For the same reason, I didn\u2019t talk about anything that was bothering me. In Russia we have an expression: \u201cIf I\u2019m hungry and you\u2019re full, you won\u2019t understand me.\u201d A billionaire doesn\u2019t understand what shitty problems I have. It\u2019s bad business. Telling your guy might get him to help you once, or twice, but it\u2019s going to turn a potential regular, long-term client into a non-repeat customer. A guy will complain to you over and over, but he doesn\u2019t want to hear your complaints. I promise you that. I tried to be entertaining. I would tell clients I just got back from Dubai, or Hawaii. I\u2019ve never been to either place, but I learned about them on television and I told stories about all the sheiks in the marble hotels in the desert, and the big waves at Oahu. It made me more exotic, more interesting. Guys like to fuck women with pretty faces and slim bodies, but they also like to fuck interesting girls. I don\u2019t eat a lot. Once a day I ordered vegetable fried rice from a place around the corner because it\u2019s fast\u200a\u2014\u200afive minutes to cook, five minutes to deliver, five minutes to eat\u200a\u2014\u200aand if I spent two hours in a restaurant, that\u2019s at least $1,600 I was not depositing into my bank account. I eat slower now, but still not a lot. If a guy wanted to take me to dinner, I would have a salad, and juice. No garlic, no onions, no coffee. Nothing that stinks. Even if he doesn\u2019t mind, other men will. I rarely drink and don\u2019t do drugs. Payment in advance. Condoms, of course. No discussion of price over the phone. I was available 12 hours a day, noon till midnight. I was always prompt, always nice, even when the client was rude. One or two bad reviews can hurt business. I liked to book two or three days in advance. If a guy emailed and said, \u201cHey, what\u2019s up, are you free later?\u201d I wouldn\u2019t see a guy like that. It\u2019s better to have two great, dependable clients than 10 occasional customers. That\u2019s what\u2019s called the \u201c80\u201320 principle.\u201d I read it in a business book. I would travel with clients. I wanted them to know I was special, but not bitchy. So when I told them I wanted first class on the jet, I didn\u2019t say, \u201cYou have to treat me right!\u201d I said, \u201cI have really long legs and in coach they get cramped and then I lose my flexibility, I cannot do doggie style so good.\u201d That seemed to do the trick. Even though what I really want to do is to be a film director, or a psychologist, I study business, too. I had to. One of the biggest things I always read was to learn from your mistakes. My biggest mistake when I started was when the guy asked if I had a boyfriend, and I said no, which was true. Then when he asked why not, I said \u201cBecause he couldn\u2019t fuck me good.\u201d I said that because I thought it would get the men excited. But what happened is the guy would try to fuck you so hard. So hard! I could tell it wasn\u2019t the natural way they did it, it was awful. So after that, when a guy would ask why I don\u2019t have a boyfriend, I would frown a little and say, \u201cWell, he was Jewish and I didn\u2019t want to convert because it would have killed my parents,\u201d and the guy would look at me and hold my hand and say, \u201cOh, I totally understand, poor thing,\u201d and all the guys would be so sweet, and gentle. Even the Jewish guys. Ninety percent of my clients were married, and most were bankers. If you know an investment banker who tells you he\u2019s never been to an escort, you know a saint\u200a\u2014\u200aor more likely a liar. About a third of the guys liked to watch me masturbate. I\u2019d say 98 percent wanted to go down on me. Fifty percent told me what big dicks they have. The ones who bothered me were the ones who really did have giant dicks (about one fifth of the guys who thought they did). No girl wants to take one of those on. Eighty percent asked if I came. Some wanted to take me shopping; others wanted to take me to dinner. One guy just sat and looked at me like I was a statue. I asked him if he didn\u2019t want to do something, to have some fun, and he just shushed me. Another guy just fucked me for an hour, and he kept making train noises, \u201cWooo, wooo, wooo.\u201d I put my finger in his ass so he\u2019d come faster, but it didn\u2019t work. Finally I just lay there, didn\u2019t even pretend I was enjoying it. That\u2019s rare for me, to stop pretending. But come on. Woo, woo, wooo? It was annoying. Men are all alike, but they\u2019re all different, too. One guy paid me $20,000 a month and I needed to be available to him two full days and nights every week. He was 62, divorced, a very nice guy. I would have liked a couple other guys like him. Sometimes we went to movies, or to dinner. Sometimes we fucked. He had cancer and he said he loved me and wanted to marry me. I don\u2019t know how much money he had. I didn\u2019t want to marry him and find out he just had debt. And I wasn\u2019t comfortable asking him how much he would leave me. This might sound odd, but it just doesn\u2019t seem right to ask. Plus, I didn\u2019t want to make him feel bad. For business reasons, and because I liked him. He used to get four or five escorts a week, but he stopped after he met me because he said he loves me. I needed to be honest with him. So I told him, \u201cI like you, but I don\u2019t love you. I can\u2019t fall in love in just a few months.\u201d He said that was okay, I was young, I would learn. I had another guy in his 60s, from Illinois. He said he wanted me to move to Illinois with him. \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d I didn\u2019t come from Russia to the United States so that I could live in fucking Illinois! I didn\u2019t tell him that, but it\u2019s what I thought. He said he had come to New York to find a wife, because New York was the best, and escorts in New York were the best. He said they all like to fuck so much. They all like to please you. I was in a bad mood, so I said, \u201cWe like to please you because you pay us!\u201d We stopped seeing each other after that. I had one guy videotape us having sex and when I noticed I grabbed his phone and erased it and told him to get the hell out of my apartment. I had another guy tell me he wanted free sex, or he was going to call the cops. I told him I would put his phone number up on Backpage.com and say he was a gay escort. You run into assholes, and you have to know how to handle them. Young guys are bad. Virgins are awful. Young virgins are a nightmare. I had one guy, all he had done was watch porn and jerk off until he was 25. So it was \u201cDo this position, do that position, turn over, turn around.\u201d I don\u2019t think he even knew how to talk to a woman. I felt sad for him. But I tried to be nice. Clients fall into four categories. There are the guys who want to pay for your companionship. There are the guys who think they\u2019re buying a relationship. There are the ones who think they own you. And then there are the couples. The first group is the simplest. The second, while they think they\u2019re sweet, can be much more demanding. The guys in the third group were the biggest headaches. One guy demanded to pour honey all over me before he fucked me. I said no. He said he\u2019d pay double and I said no. He said he\u2019d pay triple and I said okay. The whole time, I was thinking about cleaning the sheets, and another two and half hours of hair and makeup. That\u2019s when I decided that if he ever asked me for honey again, I\u2019d charge quadruple. At least. My favorite kind of client was the fourth kind\u200a\u2014\u200athe guy who invited me over for a threesome with his wife, or girlfriend. A great thing about doing couples: With a couple, you would go through the door and see a table covered with good wine, different types of cheese and fruits, like it\u2019s a celebration of something. If it\u2019s just a guy, you see a glass of water and an envelope on the shelf. There were also more positive emotions\u200a\u2014\u200amore emotions, period. With a guy, you feel like he wants to have it all, to make sure he\u2019s getting his money\u2019s worth. When it\u2019s a girl, you can just relax and have your conversation. You can eat fruit. Usually threesomes are two or three hours long. The couples were always shy, even though they had done threesomes before. (I was never the first for a couple. I\u2019m not sure why.) I had to do the first step. \u201cI\u2019d like to get to know you better,\u201d I would say, or, \u201cI\u2019d like to kiss you.\u201d Even with the emotions and the conversation, I knew, they were not paying me to talk. First I would be with the girl. Then the guy would be standing there and wouldn\u2019t know what to do, so I would invite him to kiss with us. All of a sudden we\u2019d all be naked, in the bed, but then it would be the girl and me having fun, and the guy doing his own thing, and honestly, I would forget about him. His girlfriend would definitely forget about him. I promise you that. And then after 30 minutes, she would remember she had a boyfriend and that he might be lonely. She would usually give him a blow job then. Ninety percent of the time I wouldn\u2019t do much with the guy in a threesome. Partly because I was having so much fun with his girlfriend, but mostly because it wouldn\u2019t have been good business. I didn\u2019t want the girls to be jealous. I loved doing couples, but I charged more than twice as much. I got $2,000 an hour, and the sessions were usually at least two hours. I charged more not because the work was harder\u200a\u2014\u200ait obviously wasn\u2019t\u200a\u2014\u200abut because I could. That\u2019s the cool thing about capitalism. It was hard to quit. My psychologist said the best way to leave the business was to think about doing it the rest of my life. Usually, a girl thinks she\u2019ll work one more week, save a few more thousand dollars. Or one month, one more trip to Las Vegas. But then another year has passed. I would see girls on The Erotic Review with 600 reviews. That\u2019s 10 years, at least. I didn\u2019t want to be one of those girls. Some of my girlfriends have quit but they haven\u2019t managed to stay quit. One got a job on Wall Street. They pay her $6,000 a month. I used to make that in a day. So did she. She escorts in her spare time. It\u2019s hard to give up money. Another girlfriend got a job at an advertising agency. Nice people, good benefits, interesting work. But she started at $80,000 a year. She knew she could make that in two months as an escort, so she decided she would just take the occasional client, just to \u201csupplement\u201d her income. Now she\u2019s almost full-time at both jobs. She\u2019s making money, but she\u2019s a wreck. I don\u2019t know if I would recommend being an escort. I know that there are dangers. Getting arrested is just one thing. I read about the serial killers. Child trafficking. Violent pimps. I think those people should be locked up forever. But I never felt close to any of that stuff. I think it\u2019s because I approached it like a business. My psychologist says I was lucky. I miss some things, not just the money. I enjoyed to dress nice all the time, to put on makeup. Now I don\u2019t have a reason to even put nail polish on, and I miss that. I\u2019m wearing my T-shirt and jeans every day for weeks, and I do my own manicure and pedicure, and sometimes that makes me a little sad. I\u2019ve had one boyfriend since I quit escorting. I met him at a nice bar. He was just a few years older than me, very polite, a banker. When I met him, he told me he used to fly in his private jet to Vegas all the time. I believed him. But then when we went out, it was always, \u201cLet\u2019s just meet for drinks, why don\u2019t you come over later?\u201d Since then I\u2019ve been dating. I use the internet, and everyone\u200a\u2014\u200aguys and girls\u200a\u2014\u200aposts ads of themselves on Match, or OkCupid, or wherever, saying how great they are, how they like long walks on the beaches and they\u2019re looking for fun, or love, or whatever. Dating is weird. My clients were older than the guys I\u2019m dating now, and these guys don\u2019t have that much money. Clients, if they like you, they spoil you very well. Boyfriends don\u2019t really care. They have their dinners with work, their ball games they watch with their guy friends. Before my job I never did blow jobs for boyfriends. If they would ask, I would be like, \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Or if they would say, \u201cChange positions,\u201d I would be like, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Since I quit, no blow jobs, either. If you\u2019re dating somebody and he didn\u2019t live good before, and you start giving him blow jobs and doing different positions, you can spoil him. I don\u2019t want to spoil someone that much. If someone\u2019s not paying you, you don\u2019t have to do blow jobs, you don\u2019t have to smile all the time, you can be yourself. But after a while you feel like something is missing. The something is money. You\u2019re sitting in the same apartment, you\u2019re the same you, but something is missing. Your wallet is empty. Sex is sex, but money is money. I don\u2019t regret what I\u2019ve done with my body, or my life. I had some good times and some not-so-good times. I\u2019ve met some interesting people and some idiots. I\u2019ve learned a lot about what men and women want and need. I don\u2019t eat $100 breakfasts anymore. No smiling blow jobs. I don\u2019t hang out with some of my old escort girlfriends. I miss them, but I have to weigh, okay, on one side friendships with whores, on the other side, a family, and my future. So I make a choice. In one of my film classes, we watched The Great Gatsby. Gatsby always wanted to be something better. He would never really do it, but he tried. The girls in this business, they want to touch this new world all around them, so they go to expensive stores, expensive restaurants. You want to be someone you have never been. If you\u2019re a girl who is pretty and has dreams and maybe comes from a small town where men behave differently toward you because you\u2019re prettier than the other girls, you think that will help you be something better. So you try. It can help you get money, that\u2019s for sure. But after, you have to find that world for yourself. Svetlana Z is a 24-year-old former escort living in New York City.

On Jan. 22, CBS San Francisco obtained a letter allegedly written by John Anglin, the convict who escaped from Alcatraz in 1962 with his brother, Clarence, and another prisoner named Frank Morris. The three men are the only people in history who escaped from Alcatraz and are still unaccounted for, the U.S. Marshal for the Northern District of California, Donald O\u2019Keefe, told OMGFacts through a spokesperson. The FBI has claimed for decades that the men drowned, supposedly carried out to sea by the powerful riptides of San Francisco Bay. But the letter\u200a\u2014\u200awhich the man claiming to be Anglin reportedly sent to the San Francisco police back in 2013 (we\u2019re still not sure why it wasn\u2019t made public earlier, though the reason is, presumably, police secrecy)\u200a\u2014\u200atells a different story. \u201cMy name is John Anglin. I escape [sic] from Alcatraz in June 1962 with my brother Clarence and Frank Morris,\u201d the letter says, according to CBS SF. \u201cI\u2019m 83 years old and in bad shape. I have cancer. Yes we all made it that night but barely!\u201d Anglin goes on to propose a deal to the cops: \u201cIf you announce on TV that I will be promised to first go to jail for no more than a year and get medical attention, I will write back to let you know exactly where I am. This is no joke\u2026\u201d Unfortunately the feds didn\u2019t take him up on it. Here\u2019s what did happen, though, according to the U.S. Marshals, which is the only federal agency still actively working to track down the three fugitives. The San Francisco police sent the letter to the U.S. Marshals, who forwarded it to the FBI for a forensic handwriting analysis. The FBI, somewhat maddeningly, said the results of that analysis were \u201cinconclusive\u201d and didn\u2019t give any more information. O\u2019Keefe, the U.S. Marshal, said the agency doesn\u2019t have any other leads to follow up on. But he said the case is still open and will stay open \u201cas long as the possibility exists that any of the three are alive.\u201d In his letter, the man claiming to be Anglin says Morris died in 2008 and his brother Clarence passed away in 2011. \u201cJohn\u201d says he\u2019s living in southern California, which, if it\u2019s true, would mean the cops have done a pretty crappy job of finding him. Anglin\u2019s been an American legend for more than half a century: The media, both nationally and internationally, has breathlessly covered the escape story for decades. In 1979, a hit movie about the escape was released, starring Clint Eastwood. John and Clarence Anglin were born in the early 1930s to a poor Southern farming family. The brothers quickly developed a taste for crime. When they were in their 20s, they were arrested for robbing banks and thrown in prison. They spent time in several Southern cellblocks. Eventually, they were transferred to Alcatraz after trying to escape from the maximum security facility where they were being held in Atlanta. Alcatraz, which is surrounded by strong, cold ocean currents, was supposed to be inescapable. The Anglin brothers met Frank Morris in jail\u200a\u2014\u200apossibly at Alcatraz, possibly in Georgia; no one really knows\u200a\u2014\u200aand soon hatched an elaborate escape plan. Morris was the mastermind: He had an IQ higher than 98% of the population and clearly knew how to use it to his advantage. The three convicts\u200a\u2014\u200aplus a fourth, Allen West, who got stuck crawling through a hole in the wall on the night of the escape and ended up testifying to all these juicy details you\u2019re about to hear\u200a\u2014\u200aused kitchen spoons and a homemade drill made from a vacuum cleaner to open air vents in their cells, which led to an unguarded utility corridor behind the cell block. Then, the men set up a workshop on the roof of their cellblock, still inside the building, where they could work in private, in the middle of the night, on their plan. The four men spent months plotting, and finally, on June 11, 1962, they sprung into action. They\u2019d built dummy heads out of a homemade papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 mixture of toilet paper, soap and water\u200a\u2014\u200awith real hair from the prison barbershop\u200a\u2014\u200awhich they placed on their pillows to fool the guard who made the night rounds into thinking they were sound asleep. Then they climbed a ventilation shaft to the roof of the building, hauling a bunch of gear with them, including a homemade raft they\u2019d made by stitching dozens of raincoats together. (They later inflated the raft with an accordion-like instrument called a concertina, which they\u2019d taken from a fellow prisoner.) They had homemade paddles they\u2019d built from plywood to paddle the raft across the dark channel to the mainland. It was about 10pm when the three men emerged onto the prison roof, stole to the edge of the building and slid down a stovepipe to the ground four stories below. From there, they climbed a pair of barbed wire fences, made their way to the shore\u200a\u2014\u200aout of sight of the guard towers and rifle turrets\u200a\u2014\u200aand shoved off into the bay. Prison guards didn\u2019t notice the men were gone until morning. They launched a huge manhunt that turned up nothing but a couple pieces of the raft and a paddle on nearby Angel Island. According to West, the prisoner who got stuck in his air vent, the plan was to steal a car once they reached the mainland. But the plan might not have involved a car theft at all: In an interview with \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Wanted\u201d in the early 1990s, a former Alcatraz inmate, Thomas Kent, claimed Clarence Anglin\u2019s girlfriend was going to pick up the prisoners and drive them to Mexico. In the 55 years since the escape, all kinds of leads, rumors and stories have emerged about the men\u2019s whereabouts. In 2011, an 89-year-old guy in Georgia, Bud Morris, told a local news station that he was a cousin of Frank Morris, that he\u2019d personally delivered envelopes of cash to a prison guard at Alcatraz and that he\u2019d met with Frank in a park near San Diego after the escape. In 2016, the Anglin family showed a photo to 11 Alive, a news outlet in Atlanta, that they claimed was of John and Clarence in Brazil. The family had been given the photo by an international drug smuggler named Fred Brizzi, who\u2019d known the Anglins as a kid. None of these leads have gone anywhere, according to the U.S. Marshals. But tons of people think the escape was successful. After all, why would the case remain open if authorities didn\u2019t think the three convicts might still be alive? The Anglin letter from last week seems to support the idea that the fugitives succeeded that cold night over a half century ago. Of course, the other possibility is that whoever helped the three convicts escape that night, whoever helped them re-settle into society with aliases, is keeping their mouth shut. As Jeff Harp, a former FBI special agent, told CBS San Francisco: \u201cThey\u2019re getting up there in age, someone knows [where they are], \u2019cause if they made it out they communicated with somebody, so somebody somewhere knows\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s still alive.\u201d By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

Each product is designed with a slightly different take on how much interface is just right. Some go incredibly minimal, others go all out.

Here\u2019s my approach to finding the right balance of interface within a product. Different tasks call for different \u201camounts\u201d of interface. Take writing a new story on Medium for example. Hit the \u201cNew Story\u201d button, and you\u2019re presented with this.

Take the time to really think about each task in isolation. I like to write a list of everything that comes to my mind around a task, and then filter out what isn\u2019t strictly necessary to complete that task. These tasks may be great additions later, but having the strict necessities forms a nice basis for deciding just how much interface to give a user. Click on a photo from Unsplash, and this is the interface you get\u200a\u2014\u200adownload, collect, like and close. Looking at data and user feedback is a great way to find out how well suited the interface is to the user\u2019s requirements. This will enable you to then look back and determine whether the interface supporting that task needs to be dialled back or more features added.

The truthful answer is: I don\u2019t know what else to do. I\u2019ve already been doing it for a decade, and it\u2019s how I make my money. Starting a new vocation doesn\u2019t appeal to me. (I like to avoid high-risk, low-reward effort at all times.) That\u2019s not to say my writing\u2019s great. It\u2019s better (and more profitable) than my music\u200a\u2014\u200abut in much the same way that a Mazda can scorch a Hyundai over a quarter-mile. The first person to ever tell me my writing wasn\u2019t any good\u200a\u2014\u200aaside from angry Internet comments\u200a\u2014\u200awas someone very, very close to me. And it cut pretty deep. So I stopped writing, because the idea of doing something that actively turned off someone so close to me is a fate worse than a thousand lashes. That person left my life. When she did, I started writing again. A lot. I began pouring my every waking thought onto paper, writing about monsters that scare me. And, like the very best monsters in all the most thrilling films, the monsters I fear the most are the demons who hold me under their possession. And after a lot of spilled words and stray thoughts, I was able to reach an uneasy conclusion: I had a disease. I was full of shit. And, then, I looked in the mirror and realized\u200a\u2014\u200ain no small or uncertain terms\u200a\u2014\u200athat I was the shit I was full of. I suppose this essay is an atonement. Or a correction. Or an acknowledgment, at the very least. Whatever it is, it\u2019s all I have: Like I said, I don\u2019t know what else to do. I bring this all up to talk about social media. For what\u2019s felt like an eternity, I felt a need to be heard. I felt a need to be seen. And for a long time, I quenched this thirst by posting incessantly to social media. 20,000 Facebook posts. 50,000 tweets. I did it because I was lonely, and also because and the idea of talking to people in real life scared me\u200a\u2014\u200abecause in real life I can\u2019t edit or curate myself the way I can on my touch-screen. I could always be clever. I could always be interesting. I could always be liked, adored, envied and admired. But I was sharing too much of myself\u200a\u2014\u200athe wrong parts of myself\u200a\u2014\u200aand then I lost my actual sense of self. I became lonely, because I realized that the real me had vanished and fled to unreachable,\u00a0unknowable\u00a0depths. I couldn\u2019t even remember my life before I started filtering it through the lens of status updates. And so I developed an insatiable desire to reconnect with myself, and become closer and more intimate with people close to me. So I made a decision late last year: I wanted to stop posting to Facebook and Twitter. Since January 1, I\u2019ve done exactly that. Instead, I\u2019ve spent 2018 working on becoming more secure in the way I relate to people\u200a\u2014\u200aand writing about it here at Medium. It\u2019s going pretty well. Meanwhile, we\u2019re finding out now that the gamification of social media\u200a\u2014\u200athe likes, the comments, the hearts, the claps, the friends, the followers\u200a\u2014\u200amakes it dangerously addictive and is destroying the fabric of society. It\u2019s why everyone\u2019s Instagram looks vaguely the same, and why now everyone visits the walls of restaurants instead of the restaurants themselves. We\u2019ve become distorted, homogenized, airbrushed, photoshopped, Instagrammed approximations of our ideal selves. Our real names and real pictures now stand in as avatars for a certain aesthetic. We\u2019ve all become Human Highlight Films\u200a\u2014\u200aand the better the highlights, the better the human. This is not finding beauty in the boring. This is projecting beauty in the boring. This is not finding joy in the everyday, this is broadcasting joy in the everyday. Nobody is as happy as they appear. Nobody is as successful as they are for the five minutes out of the 24 hours each day at which they peak. That 483-like profile picture\u200a\u2014\u200athe best of the 61 selfies we took in that ten-minute span, washed in filters and in just the right light\u200a\u2014\u200ais vacuum-sealed validation. This is not a reflection, this is a distortion. Our friend lists, photo albums and shared links are all carefully curated to represent and reflect ourselves at our most desirable, most likable, most True To Ourselves(TM). Except on occasion, when we post that rare peek behind the curtain in the shape of a black-and-white candid shot of ourselves, with a caption where we explain the virtues of vulnerability, even as those pictures and posts are edited and filtered to death and/or given an unvarnished sheen to reflect the starkness and seriousness with which we wish to be taken. This obsession with participating in, and lording over our own micro-empires in, the grand Shareable Content Marketplace(TM) has left us all in poverty of spirit, enslaved to our egos, stagnated in our personal growth, and obsessed with our image. It is a sickness, and a deficit of virtue. It\u2019s causing us to become crazed creatures who are either losing or feigning interest in absolutely everyone and everything. We\u2019re projecting authenticity, while the truth disappears. We\u2019re ravenous for attention, but what we\u2019re really starving for is love. I examine my feelings about it, and wonder what story people are trying to tell the world about themselves. What picture we are trying to paint. But, most importantly, I wonder why we feel the need to paint that picture at all. It\u2019s performance art. Except without the art. I examine my own pathology, and think it\u2019s possible we might all do it to feel a little less lonely, and a little more important. Our lives are lonely. No one can ever really know the 24x7, underneath-the-skin version of us. Yet the constant wall of content that\u2019s meant to bring us closer to others actually makes us more distant. Our lives are also impermanent, and everything feels more important than it is. Our lives are tiny and random, like bees or sharks. It is through our own deluded sense of self-worth, our ego and our ambitions that we convince ourselves our lives are these grand, big things worthy of parades and newspaper clippings. By our false belief in our own exceptionalism, we\u2019re burying ourselves in a sea of sameness and monotony, and suddenly it\u2019s impossible to gauge what\u2019s truly big from what\u2019s truly small. It\u2019s all become mediocre basic life dressed up in the trappings of quasi-art, as the Venn diagram between brands and people continue to blur and overlap. We\u2019re trying to become less lonely and more meaningful by creating exponentially more tenuous connections, when what we should really be doing is becoming more secure in ourselves and the connections we already have. Becoming secure in ourselves and our connections starts with simply being aware of our surroundings. Where are you? Who is with you? How do you feel? How do you feel about them? What do you want to do? Notice these things. Embrace them. This is the opposite of turning our smartphone into a screening app through which we can exhaustively filter, delete, edit and tune out the life we used to see through our own eyes and process in our own hearts. You can tell we\u2019ve drifted so far from awareness by the way we\u2019ve been talking about it. Somewhere along the way, we stopped telling people to say \u201cthank you,\u201d and started telling people to \u201cpractice gratitude.\u201d We stopped telling people to \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d and started telling people to \u201cpractice mindfulness.\u201d We\u2019re caught on a mill of making being merely aware feel like more work than it used to be. We don\u2019t need to do this\u200a\u2014\u200awe can just be. Notice people. Be present for them. Ask follow-up questions. Exchange ideas. And constantly do this for yourself. Observe how you feel. Be present for you. Question your condition. Find solutions to your problems. This is awareness. This is the path to finding truth and peace, and the quickest escape route off the hashtag-living-my-best-life hamster wheel. Only when we\u2019ve cultivated awareness can we trust what we see. Only when we trust what we see can we become secure in ourselves and connections. And only from security can a healthy, meaningful love truly blossom\u200a\u2014\u200aand our loneliness can melt away into the sea. Perhaps I am just lamenting awareness as a dead technology, or thinking that perhaps reality is now just too impermanent and lonely to deal with anymore. I don\u2019t know a lot beyond what the mind watches and what scalds the heart\u200a\u2014\u200athe things I\u2019m aware of, and the things that I write about. Since I left social media, I\u2019ve already noticed myself cultivating deeper relationships with the people I care about, and started listening to a softer, sweeter voice in my own head. Most of my writing is still shit, but I have fun making it. I don\u2019t care what it does in the Shareable Content Marketplace. The creation is the beauty itself. The process is the point. Not everything that I do has to be competitive, not everything is a contest to be won or a truckload of likes to be garnered. These are misguided Western values cloaked in capitalism, barbarism and vanity. The only way we beat back the twin-barreled firing squad of loneliness and impermanence is by staying healthy, and doing things that matter to us, with the people we love. That\u2019s how we live a full, if tiny, life. It all starts with awareness\u200a\u2014\u200aand from there, the world opens up. My only life goals are to see the sun often, and drink my coffee black while it\u2019s out. And then to make love under the stars. My happiness is not material. I can\u2019t get it or achieve it, and it\u2019s not exclusive to me. My writing is how I pass the time, and it\u2019s part of how I connect on a deeper level with people. My words will live on long after I\u2019ve gone, because the Internet is for fucking ever. I suppose this is how I will achieve my own trite version of immortality. I\u2019ll be back on social media in 2019 (probably), and by the very nature of what I do I can\u2019t deactivate my accounts completely, but I promise my data trail won\u2019t become my legacy\u200a\u2014\u200amy relationships with people will be. I don\u2019t need to always be clever, interesting, liked, adored, envied, admired, seen or heard. I can simply be me, off the grid, and secure. Sharing more by posting less. Being a body instead of a brand. And writing more. I\u2019m not a human highlight film\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019m merely a human. And, goddammit, I intend to stay human.

For some of us, that\u2019s good. We like writing, and it makes up for our other social and professional deficiencies. \ud83d\ude05 For others, it might just not be their thing. I bet this second group is in the majority. And maybe that\u2019s why you\u2019re reading this. Here are five types of articles relevant for designers. If you\u2019re trying to get into writing and feeling stuck, this may help you pin down an approach. Pick one and start sharing your wisdom with us. Here\u2019s a stance\u2014the best designers are those that balance fierce opinions with confident humility. The old strong opinions loosely held maxim. The thing about opinions is you need them to design, and writing about them is an excellent way to jump into writing. Your thoughts, blood, and guts laid out on the notepad of life. Kidding, but really, these are insightful articles with a message. Maybe the message isn\u2019t super practical, or maybe it is. It should make a clear point, preferably in not-too-many words. The key thing is it\u2019s your opinion. Writing about our opinions on design helps us to develop and articulate how we approach problems, and clarify what\u2019s important to us. They help us find a voice, establish our own design principles, and help readers to figure out their own opinions. Plus there is such a low barrier to entry. A brain will do. Go write. The possibilities are endless, but best to start by observing everything and making meaning out of it all. The place you live, the people you interact with, the books you read, the movies you watch, the struggles you have, any success you achieve. The best opinion pieces speak from the heart and connect everyday things to our lives as designers (or, as people). Now we\u2019re getting to more practical design writing. Process pieces help designers work better, whether that\u2019s in formulating their design process, learning how they can fix small or big problems, and balance being \u2018heads down\u2019 and contributing to their company as a whole. It\u2019s helpful, and will make you a trusted resource for people struggling. Work is hard. People are weird. Dynamics at work can be good, or terrible, usually a bit of both. Figuring out the processes to work better will always be a valuable contribution. Be overly observant in you workplace. Writing about processes and improving the day-to-day work life of designers requires empathy with those around you. Talk to people, both those with ideas for how things should be, and those who are frustrated with the current state. Gather your thoughts, write, publish, repeat. These articles are by far the most practical type, since they dig into the craft of design and the tools we all use. Writing them shows we know our stuff, and we have command of the craft. We\u2019ve always had tools, and we need to learn those tools to do our work. These pieces give us guidance and instruction to create things. Some simple, some complex. All very useful. Two things. First, it shows we can deliver. Delivering is good. Second, it shows we can explain and teach others how to deliver. Those are two essential characteristics of any designer who hopes to earn a living doing design, and grow into a design leader. Experiment with your tools, watch other designer videos and read their articles. Be a creator, and document your steps. Once you know your tool, you\u2019ll be able to share it. But tools are changing fast. Your piece might be outdated in a few months. Keep this in mind as you write, and decide whether you want to focus on specific features, or on the concepts behind the features. Good for an empty portfolio, for fun, to learn, and for making enemies. Could even land you a job. These pieces are the ones where designers take someone else's product, analyze it, and in some cases redesign certain elements (or the whole damn thing). \u201cHow I\u2019d Redesign Gmail in an Hour\u201d, or \u201cWhy LinkedIn needs more Dark Patterns\u201d. Feel free to steal those. These pieces speak volumes (good and bad) to how you approach problems, and come up with solutions. They\u2019re often shared a lot, so it can be a way to get some eyes on you as well. Careful though, they can work for or against you. Don\u2019t be presumptuous, or inflate how great you think your redesign is. Design never happens in a vacuum, and designers always need to compromise. A lone designer, with little to no research, no team dynamics, a working coffee machine, and full control over the heat of their room. That\u2019s not the real world. Be honest and humble, above all else. Give props where they\u2019re due. Your article should flatter them, not piss them off. Be clear on why you\u2019re writing it, and frame the approach accordingly. Critique is a funny thing. People are not known for giving helpful feedback on design. But it\u2019s something that designers need to be good at. In my opinion, good digital product design critique is lacking. Similar to the teardowns above, but more conceptual. A critique is not necessarily redesigning anything, or touching an interface, though it can be. It should get to the heart of a product\u2019s value proposition, or how it was executed. Like teardowns and opinion pieces, it shows you have a mind. And, if done well, that you have the powers of critical thinking and analysis. These are all important qualities for designers, so showing you have them is a good thing. Designers tend to lean towards one of two critique styles\u200a\u2014\u200atearing apart others\u2019 work (ie the MO of the internet) or giving pure praise (Dribbble). Try to approach critique with more nuance. Like you\u2019re critiquing the work of a friend you care about, and also want to succeed. Candid feedback is what he/she needs, but every product has good and bad, so make sure to be balanced. I couldn\u2019t leave without my favorite flavor of article. Not a type, exactly, but a style I wish more designers wrote in. Humor and satire is self explanatory. They are the pieces that make you laugh, giggle, or snicker. Maybe even chuckle or snort. Emphasis here on you, the writer. Your readers may or may not laugh, but as long as you do, keep going. A sense of humor is healthy. Laughter is good for the soul. If we can\u2019t laugh at ourselves, then we\u2019re taking things too seriously. Our professions included. It is possible to be serious about good design, and still laugh at all of our collective quirks. I think it\u2019s ideal to have some truth behind the jokes, if possible. When I wrote my 2018 UX predictions, it was a bit random, but I also wanted to highlight issues within our industry. When I wrote about alternatives to the hamburger menu, I wanted to make fun of this ubiquitous icon everyone uses. (Links below) Writing with humor is freeing, and it allows you to shed any anxieties you have about putting your words out in the world. Or at least trade them for a different kind of anxiety (a fun kind). If you\u2019re trying to get started in writing, it\u2019s a great gateway drug. Thanks for reading! I hope you enjoyed the piece.

She\u2019d planned her response in advance: a simple introduction, then she\u2019d just stand there and watch the other woman react to her last name with (ideally) horrified guilt. But in the moment, Maggie couldn\u2019t speak. Her face flushed. Her hands shook. We left immediately. On the walk home she finally spoke, the words coming so fast she almost choked. I rubbed her back. This is when face-to-face communication is crucial\u2014nothing I could have said would have helped, but gestures (hugs, back rubs, concerned face) made it clear I\u2019d heard her and understood. According to the psychiatric journal Activitas Nervosa Superior, \u201cEmotion arises from sensory stimulation and is typically accompanied by physiological and behavioral changes in the body.\u201d We express our emotions most clearly through physical reactions\u2014Maggie\u2019s flushed cheeks and shaking hands\u2014and receive comfort most effectively this way too. In highly emotional situations, gestures and expressions can usually communicate better than words. But gestures weren\u2019t available the next day, so I did what any busy, young, too-broke-to-send-flowers New Yorker checking on a friend from work would do: I sent a few emojis. But what was the right combination of tiny pictures to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this and I know it sucks hard now and I want you to know it won\u2019t suck forever because you\u2019re great\u201d? Turns out, for Maggie at least, the right emoji sequence to symbolize sympathizing with heartbreak is a series of smiley poops. Two days later we had dinner in person. \u201cI\u2019m feeling better,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a session with my therapist\u2026 And your text the other day made me laugh\u2014that helped.\u201d Tiny cartoon poops helped. It sounds stupid. Their cuteness makes any serious conversation about emojis difficult, like talking to a baby in a grown-up voice. It feels embarrassing to posit these little cartoons as a vehicle of emotion or even a global language, yet they really are an almost universally understood form of communication. Most studies by social scientists, linguists, and psychologists skew pro-emoji (\u201cA smiling emoticon activates the same brain areas as the image of a person smiling and can therefore be considered as a representation of that emotion\u201d reads one study), but that doesn\u2019t stop them from seeming a little foolish: eensy cartoon images, designed to be typed alongside or in lieu of text, uncool in their enthusiasm and earnestness. Though the most tweeted emoji is a heart, most other top emojis, lending weight to the emoticon/emotion connection, are faces: \u2026and the list goes on. Smiley poop is #90 out of 845, not bad as far as poop goes, but definitely not top 10. Even so, it\u2019s been used more than eight million times since July of last year, on Twitter alone, according to the mesmerizing, potentially seizure-inducing real-time emojitracker.com. Why can\u2019t we stop using emojis? Are they ridiculous, turning us into the equivalent of button-pressing Neanderthals? Or are they brilliant, providing a global medium to express our emotions and creativity? \u201cEmojis mean everything and they mean nothing at the same time,\u201d designer Liza Nelson wrote on her emoji art tumblr, Emoji IRL. LOL. \u201cThey\u2019re really quite stupid. And they\u2019re the best thing that ever happened to our generation.\u201d Emojis are weird. And cute. And teensy. My mom uses them but calls them \u201cthose phone pictures.\u201d President Obama referred to them in a speech as \u201clittle emoji or whatever those things are.\u201d Like almost everyone I know, I use emojis. But I\u2019m conflicted about them\u2014both enamored of their creative and emotive capacity and embarrassed to attach myself to something so ridiculous. Not everyone feels this way, but I\u2019m not alone in my ambivalence. From a certain perspective emojis are our bread and circuses, cringingly frivolous. Friends are sometimes compelled to apologize after a long burst of emojis: \u201cSorry, got carried away.\u201d My boyfriend texts me the Man Walking Away emoji when my own tiny cartoon messages become too long-winded. But my well-honed emoji vocabulary (even more so after writing this) is handy when I want to communicate with my sister, a new mom who rarely has both hands free. There are days when we text only in pictures: \u2026and so on, lending some credence to the Time magazine\u2019s warning that emojis might lead us to \u201cstop using words altogether.\u201d Et tu, smiling poop? This \u201cemojis are the end of language\u201d complaint, usually seen in the comments below articles rather than in the articles themselves, is a variation on the more common theme \u201cemojis are dumb and make us dumber,\u201d painting a picture of the entire human race as a horde of blithering idiots unable to communicate without typing pictures. It\u2019s a bit bleak, and doesn\u2019t really put a lot of faith in us as individual people with our own brains and agency, but the flip side is that in this potential future the entire human race is communicating with each other. Could it really be that the great promise of the World Wide Web has been achieved by the likes of unamused face, blowing kiss face, and smiley poop? It\u2019s a disconcertingly simple solution. Emojis are small in size but huge in reach\u2014perhaps nothing so tiny has been so universally known since Walt Disney introduced the world to Mickey Mouse. This strange incongruity might be part of why we can\u2019t seem to stop talking about emojis. The current media buzz around emojis has come later than usual for tech trends. Barthes wrote, \u201cMass culture is a machine for showing desire: here is what must interest you, it says.\u201d But emojis infiltrated our lives from the outside: There was never an emoji ad campaign, and not only do iPhones come without a built-in emoji keyboard (while Android users couldn\u2019t even access emojis until the end of last year), it\u2019s not at all obvious how to activate said keyboard; I learned from my ex-boyfriend\u2019s new girlfriend at his sister\u2019s birthday two years ago, which made me like her instantly despite our dubious connection. Emojis are one of very few products not pushed on us, so the conversation around emoji tends to be less \u201cyou should like this\u201d and more \u201cwhy do we like this?\u201d Because while emojis can be embarrassing, we continue to send them and receive them and laugh over them and read think pieces (yeah, like this one) that attempt to explain our weird addiction to them. To clarify: \u201cEmoji\u201d is the word for all of the tiny images on the emoji keyboard, first developed in mid-\u201990s Japan; \u201cemoticon\u201d refers specifically to images of faces, both emoji faces\u2014smile with heart eyes, woman raising hand, etc.\u2014and non-emoji faces. Though there are others who claim to have invented the concept of emoticons used in concert with text, consensus seems to be that Carnegie Mellon computer science professor Scott Fahlman was first to type the colon-dash-parenthesis combination\u2014:-)\u2014which, for over a decade after he suggested it in 1982, was the emoticon. The face that launched a thousand chain emails. Fahlman\u2019s creation took on a life of its own, along with a suddenly spastic use of exclamation marks, as people figured out how to communicate via the oft-problematic medium of email. Angry or inappropriate emails sent before the sender had time to think, passive-aggressive emails, and emotionally ambiguous emails were\u2014still are\u2014common inbox issues. (I\u2019ve spent hours angsting over the meaning of a \u201cThanks.\u201d What is it about the period that makes it sound so insincere?) But Fahlman wasn\u2019t exactly pleased with the popularity of his invention. In the early \u201990s he told the Boston Globe: \u201cI had no idea that I was starting something that would soon pollute all the world\u2019s communication channels.\u201d Even in their nascent years emoticons were both widely used and embarrassing. People blamed Comic Sans-loving coworkers or giggly Midwestern sisters-in-law for spreading the cutesy trend, but today it seems nearly everyone is using emojis. Maybe it\u2019s social mirroring, a concept made much of recently after Facebook increased the amount of negative words in certain people\u2019s newsfeeds and found that seeing sad posts from friends made people post sadder things themselves. Emojis probably have a similar effect: Receiving emojis results in using more emojis. But the mirroring argument is far too circular to be solved. Certainly all my friends aren\u2019t emoji pushers, and maybe a few think I spur on their emoji habits\u2014who knows who started it all? Whoever the first carrier was, we\u2019ve all caught emojis now. Fahlman complained that \u201c[emojis] ruin the challenge of trying to come up with a clever way to express emotions,\u201d basically allowing us to be lazy in our communication. This is one of the many arguments leveled against emojis. And it\u2019s true that emoji messages\u2014whether via text, Twitter, Facebook, email, etc.\u2014can be refreshingly brief, which makes them seem easy. Why say \u201cI\u2019m late but on my way\u201d when you can text a tiny running man? Or answer \u201cWhat\u2019d you do last night?\u201d in paragraph form when dancing lady + cocktail glass + boy\u2019s face + heart tell the whole story? Parents and even grandparents have started using emojis when they need to text because they don\u2019t have to type as much, and they\u2019re not yet comfortable typing on a screen. Excited about the World Cup, my friend\u2019s Dutch grandma sent him a kissy face + seven soccer balls\u2014a release of unbridled enthusiasm common in emojis but typically frowned on in person, the equivalent of jumping up and down screaming soccer! soccer! soccer! while blowing kisses. My mom\u2019s favorite way to say \u201cI\u2019m thinking about you and it makes me happy and I hope you\u2019re happy too\u201d is dolphin + dancing lady + seashell + heart. Even for a message as simple as \u201cyes,\u201d sending the thumbs-up emoji is both less curt and less work. Less work to type, that is. Interpreting received emojis can be difficult, which is interesting given that one explanation offered for their popularity is the unmatchable ability of pictures to clarify emotions. While studies have largely proved this true when it comes to visual representations of facial expressions (\u201cWeeping and its facial gestures, the turned-down mouth, the drawn brows, the cry, are common to all humans,\u201d writes Esther Cohen in The American Historical Review), it\u2019s a moot point for the hundreds of expressionless emojis. What emotions do the dancing girls dressed as cats convey? Or the boy with triangles all around his head? The two red footprints? The bento box? The dancing ghost? Possible misunderstandings abound. You certainly wouldn\u2019t want to send the purple eggplant and wind up in a sexting pickle when all you wanted to convey was your vegetarianism. Perhaps it\u2019s the ambiguities of emojis more than anything else that hold our fascination. It\u2019s the puzzle of it all\u2014double meanings, inside jokes\u2014that grabs us, from the very first heart emoji in the mid-\u201990s (\u201cwhat does it mean when a girl sends me a heart?\u201d is still among the most-asked emoji-related questions on Google) to the brand-new emojis released this summer. What could you mean by a levitating man in a business suit? What couldn\u2019t you mean? All these brand-new emojis\u2014approximately 250, including wind-blowing face, derelict house, floppy disk and \u201csleuth or spy\u201d\u2014were approved and released by the Unicode Consortium. Unicode does exactly what the name suggests: It writes computer code that enables languages to be read and written on any given device. Its coding is present in nearly every word we type or read on computers. This includes emojis, which it took on in 2010, a decision that marked the growing role of the tiny cartoons in global communication. You might recognize Unicode\u2019s sinister-sounding name from the movement to diversify emojis. For a widely accessible language, emojis are disappointingly homogenous: Besides the classic faces in Simpsons-yellow, all but two of the human faces are Caucasian. When presented with a petition in 2013 to add more diversity to the emoji keyboard, Apple introduced Unicode to the emoji-texting public by declaring: \u201cOur emoji characters are based on the Unicode standard, which is necessary for them to be displayed properly across many platforms.\u201d Unicode took the heat for the lack of emoji diversity, but truth is, the Consortium really only codes for the image outline, while details\u2014color, certain design elements\u2014vary by device. If you send a yellow heart from an iPhone, for example, it shows up as a weirdly hairy pink heart on an Android (beware, cross-device couples!). Apple technically has the ability make the race change independently, and hopefully it will\u2014Unicode\u2019s approval process sounds insane. According to its website, \u201cthe sunglasses character was first proposed years before Unicode 7.0 was released.\u201d (For anyone interested in what didn\u2019t make the cut, there\u2019s a tumblr cataloguing emojis that have been rejected by the Consortium, which include a top hat full of porn and a bearded planet earth.) It\u2019s frustrating that characters of color haven\u2019t always been a part of emojis, and the push for racially diverse characters points to emojis\u2019 growing significance. Even as I was writing this, a friend texted to say she\u2019d just gotten engaged to her girlfriend. I texted back with words first: \u201cCongratulations! That\u2019s amazing!\u201d then went for the emoji keyboard: diamond ring, check, party popper, check, non-white bride\u2026 oh. Nope. We use emojis so often that complete representation has become essential. That friend of mine has been with her partner about a year and, like most couples I know who got together anytime after 2011, their initial flirtation was emoji-heavy: hearts, winking faces, dancing lady, clinking beers, and a few suggestive late-night honeypots. These conversations are especially interesting to me because I missed the window of pre-relationship emoji flirtation. My boyfriend and I started dating in the spring of 2011, the year emojis became available on iPhones, and I was a recovering Luddite, having only just gotten my first smartphone the day of our first date. I was excited to show him my brick-like last-season Android with its thick rubber case (I\u2019d been warned that smartphones, like babies or faberg\u00e9 eggs, were extremely fragile). \u201cLook,\u201d I said proudly as I set my phone down next to his shiny, sleek iPhone. \u201cI can check my email anywhere.\u201d Those phones got to know each other well. The time between texts allows for more thoughtful flirtation than calling, so by the end of the summer I\u2019d accrued hours of staring out windows\u2014office windows, bus windows, apartment windows\u2014pondering replies. I still take a long time to text him back, and when I do, my texts usually contain emojis, or are only emojis, depending on how I feel. The other day, feeling glum about work, I asked him to pick me up a donut. He said sure and asked if everything was okay. I meditated over my emoji keyboard, figuring out what I actually felt in order to communicate using a few characters. I was already feeling better, chuckling to myself, when I sent him: computer + arrow + sad pink-shirt lady + arrow + donut + arrow + roof-raising pink-shirt lady. It felt good to puzzle out exactly why I was gloomy: nothing dire, just overwork and the tenuous fate of one project. But what really changed my mood was just the act of being silly: The ability to be silly with someone is a measure of comfort. Silliness opens us up for critique, making us more vulnerable, as fragile as I imagined my first smartphone to be. It seems the process of silly-revealing happens faster for people who\u2019ve had emojis from the very beginning of their relationships, taking early risks by communicating in dancing cat ladies, cartoon bonnets, swirling hearts, and teensy bento boxes. One friend of mine loves this aspect of her new relationship, giggling over her love interest\u2019s clue-like date suggestions: boy + girl + skier + cow? turned out to be an invitation for a weekend in Vermont). Emojis have allowed her to get an early sense that their individual goofy natures match up. But another friend feels many of the girls he\u2019s met through online dating use emojis as a crutch, leaning on winky faces and blowing kiss faces when they can\u2019t think of anything else to say. \u201cBut,\u201d he conceded, \u201cwinky-face girls seem to not be very inspired in English, either.\u201d In other words, emojis aren\u2019t magic; they won\u2019t change anybody\u2019s nature. Regardless of whether it\u2019s appreciated, people of all ages, genders, and backgrounds report using emojis in conversation with their partners, even those who don\u2019t use it with anyone else. Because these are the people we can be silly with. These are the people we love. Some people use emojis sparingly, some with abandon; some are practical while others are creative; even emoji meanings are highly personal\u2014smiley poop comforts my friend, grosses out my mom, makes my sister think of changing diapers. Emojis today are in a similar fluid state as the English language in the 16th century: Anything goes and everything is up for debate. Back then you could spell anything any which way\u2014Smith, Smythe, Smyth. Even Shakespeare varied the spelling of his own name. Punctuation was also a mess; rules for standard use didn\u2019t get locked down until the invention of the printing press. Just as we eventually agreed on the rules of English, so might we eventually agree on a single, global understanding of emojis. In an interview for The Verge, original emoji designer Shigetaka Kurita admits this is a dream of his: \u201cIt would be great if we could compare, and have that lead to people starting to use things in the same way.\u201d Though nearly everyone in the world has access to emojis we all have a slightly different understanding of the characters and phrases. It\u2019s a fantastic, utopic dream, and not a new one: Liebniz algebra, Esperanto, and Blissymbolics are just a few of many failed global language experiments over the centuries. Emojis are an accidental member of this fraternity, and there\u2019s no telling now whether it\u2019s here to stay or has reached its peak. One potential test of emoji\u2019s staying power is Emojli, a forthcoming instant-messaging app on which users communicate solely with emojis. Though the app is still under construction, I imagine it as a wordless cross between texting and Twitter. \u201cThis is not our day job,\u201d said founders Matt Gray and Tom Scott over email, \u201cit isn\u2019t a source of income, we\u2019re doing it because we thought it was a funny idea\u201d\u2014particularly the aspect of emoji usernames. Both admitted to using old-school smileys (:D and\u00a0:P) over emojis out of habit\u2014Scott Fahlman would approve. Emojli\u2019s lack of words precludes spam, chain-letter style forwards, trolling, and hashtags. You won\u2019t be able to combine words and emojis in a message, which would make certain things more challenging. Easy messages to communicate in words, such as \u201cWe\u2019re to the front right of the concert stage behind the really tall guy in the Rangers jersey,\u201d are made ambiguous in emojis, just as messages easy to convey in emojis\u2014the emotions behind hearts and smiley poop\u2014are hard to put into words. Perhaps the communication on Emojli will be more emotion-heavy, or more artistic. Only time will tell. Still, it\u2019s a fresh start, and might help normalize a common language for the huge and weird frontierland of the Internet. If text messages are the emojis\u2019 natural home, the Internet is where it goes to party. In this otherworld, emoji memes, music videos, GIFs, and digital artworks abound. The latest trend in online emoji wackiness is merging emojis with real life. Over the last couple months, artist Able Parris integrated emojis into real photographs, stock video providers Dissolve made a documentary treating emojis like a new species come to live among us, and a company called Emoji Stickers has emerged as an online seller of\u2014what else?\u2014emoji stickers to put onto anything and everything, freeing emojis from their digital cage. The precursor to all this is the aforementioned Emoji IRL.LOL: a 2013 tumblr project in which artist Liza Nelson photographs real people and objects posed and painted as emojis. Recent emoji madness isn\u2019t limited to real-life emojis projects. We\u2019ve also seen the introduction of iDiversicon\u2014the emoji characters app that allows users to copy and paste Hispanic, Indian, and African-American characters, to name a few, into a text message\u2014plus a slew of less vital emoji apps, including one with all the Seinfeld characters and one that turns your selfies into emojis. We chafe so hard against the limits of emojis. One way to push is to demand more variety: Game of Thrones emojis are on their way, and people have petitioned hard for hot dogs, Canadian flags, and middle fingers (the last of which is included in the latest Unicode batch of emojis). But endless variety would remove one of the pleasures of emojis: shared understanding. The limited number of emojis means everyone gets the joke when you say, \u201cHey, that guy looks just like the red-shirted walking man!\u201d It sounds like a small thing, but really, it\u2019s rare to have a joke that almost everyone in any given DMV will get. In turn, this common understanding of the few available characters\u2014pink-shirted girl, red-shirted boy, bald baby with one curl, dancing cat ladies\u2014is what makes the real-life emoji art of Able Parris and Dissolve resonate. It\u2019s another, arguably more creative way to push against the limits of emojis: Take what we have and put it where it doesn\u2019t belong. An emoji sun rising over a real town. An emoji face over the red-shirted torso of a real man. Emoji cars stalled in traffic on a real freeway. Emojis are a pleasurable puzzle: What\u2019s the right combination of emojis to say, \u201cI\u2019m proud of what you\u2019re doing far away but also I miss you\u201d or \u201cThat thing you did made me mad but I\u2019ve sort of halfway forgiven you and we\u2019ll be close again in like a month\u201d or \u201cThis office party is incredibly uncomfortable for many, many reasons and I need you to please come and save me\u201d? A series of smiley poops said to my friend Maggie what I\u2019d need paragraphs to say in words. Emojis are also entertaining: One friend and I play \u201cguess that song\u201d with emoji lyrics, \u00e0 la filmmaker Jesse Hill\u2019s all-emojis version of \u201cDrunk in Love.\u201d They can even be creatively inspiring: Books, movies, and TV shows have all been translated or recapped in emojis; on emojinalysis.tumblr.com you can have your fortune told based on your most-used emojis; an emoji art show was held at Chelsea\u2019s Eyebeam Gallery at the end of last year, citing emoji\u2019s emerging use as a \u201cvisual vernacular,\u201d and the Emojli founders are excited to see \u201cwhat our users might come up with when limited to just emoji.\u201d And of course emojis are inherently silly, but that\u2019s not in and of itself a bad thing. Silliness is not necessarily an indication of shallowness. In fact, I\u2019d argue the opposite: A capacity for real silliness is usually born out of pain. We\u2019re attracted to silliness because we need it. We need it because life isn\u2019t easy. Your mom is sick. Your grandfather died. You got laid off. Your company folded. Your rent went up. Your husband left. He didn\u2019t call. She didn\u2019t call. They never call. All these things happen every day, to billions of people all over the world. And if a stupid cartoon of smiling poop makes you feel better, well, that\u2019s: The entire 13' \u00d7 7' triptych (the scale of Hieronymus Bosch\u2019s original) of Carla Gannis\u2019s Garden of Emoji Delights will be shown in October at the Kasia Kay Gallery in Chicago and at the Transfer Gallery in Brooklyn.

What do you want from life? What career do you want? Most of us answer \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d And you know what? There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. And yet, we think it\u2019s the worst thing in the world if you don\u2019t know what you want to do in life. We say: \u201cOMG! I don\u2019t know what I want!\u201d And then we have a full-on panic attack. Be honest\u200a\u2014\u200ait happens to all of us. Especially, when you see that your old college friend just got married. Or that your co-worker, who started at the same time as you, just got promoted. It\u2019s at those moments of weakness when we shine a spotlight on our own uncertainty about life. One of the biggest thinking errors that I\u2019ve made was that I thought I needed to know what I exactly wanted to do with my life. The truth is that no one knows what they truly want. You could get killed by a cow tomorrow (really happened). You could lose half of your money on the stock market. Your property could go up in flames. I don\u2019t have to tell you all those things. But we must realize that we don\u2019t have the answers to most things in life. Will you stay healthy? Will the stock market crash? Will your business continue to prosper? NO ONE KNOWS! That\u2019s the beauty of life. Eleanor Roosevelt said it best: Some people ask me, \u201cWhy do you read so many books? There\u2019s no way you can apply everything you learn.\u201d They are right. I cannot. Why do I still read about all kinds of different topics? There might come a time in my life where I will need one particular piece of knowledge. And that one time I need it might just change the whole outcome of my life. I\u2018ll give you an example. In 2015, after my friends and mentors told me I should share my ideas about productivity, life, and business with others, I seriously started thinking about doing it. But there are many ways you can share your knowledge with others. You can give training to groups and host seminars. You can coach people individually. You can create videos for YouTube. You can give talks at conferences. The possibilities are endless. But because I\u2019ve always had an interest in writing and had read so much about it in the past, I realized that I should start with written ideas. That was the easiest way for me to get started. I had also learned all about creating websites in the past. So it was very easy for me to get started with all of this. In fact, I created a website in a day. And I started writing every day for a month. The result? A book and a bunch of articles. When I read about writing and building websites years ago, I didn\u2019t know I would use that knowledge to build my own blog. To be honest, I didn\u2019t know what I wanted. I only knew what direction I wanted to go in. I knew I wanted to make a contribution and do work that I enjoyed. So it\u2019s not important to know exactly what you want to do with your life. People change. Economies change. So, it\u2019s not even realistic to boldly claim \u201cI know what I want!\u201d The only thing every person needs is a sense of direction. A vision of where you\u2019d like to go. Look, you don\u2019t need to know your exact destination.You often read about people who say they always knew what they wanted. But that\u2019s just a small portion of the population. I\u2019ve personally never met someone like that. Most of us don\u2019t have that conviction from day one. It grows over time. That\u2019s what Jay Abraham also recommends in Getting Everything You Can Out of All You\u2019ve Got (which is one of my favorite business books of all time): You see that he doesn\u2019t say you should know exactly what you want? That would not be realistic. Instead, we need to know where we\u2019re roughly going. I know, it remains intangible. But that\u2019s the only helpful answer that I\u2019ve found in life. While you\u2019re figuring everything out, don\u2019t waste your time watching hours of TV, drinking booze, or eating junk food. Spend your time usefully. Learn skills you can always rely on. Need some inspiration? Here are a few skills that I\u2019m constantly working on: That\u2019s enough to keep you busy for a lifetime if you want to do it well. Pick a skill that excites you. Get better at it. Then, pick another. And keep on repeating that process. Soon enough, you\u2019ll know what you want. And if you don\u2019t, it\u2019s not the end of the world.

But they are far less than the long-range risks and costs of comfortable inaction.\u200a\u2014\u200aJohn F. Kennedy Balancing thought and action will always be a challenge for many people. Doing is carrying out a series of tasks. Thinking is reflecting on what tasks should be carried out (Thinking in this context is different from introspection or making time to think about your thinking). You can focus more on \u201cdoing\u201d while retaining your motivation for \u201cthinking\u201d. How much time should we spend thinking vs. doing? With respect to goals, projects, and other to-do items, it\u2019s easy to get stuck too long in the thinking and planning phase. Many people get excited about a lot of ideas. But unfortunately they easily begin pushing them further back on their to-do lists, if not completely disregarding them as being unfeasible orunreaslistic. Research by psychologists Arie Kruglanski, Tory Higgins, and their colleagues suggests that we have two complementary motivational systems: the \u201cthinking\u201d system and the \u201cdoing\u201d system\u200a\u2014\u200aand we\u2019re generally only capable of using one at a time. If you tend to focus more on your thinking system, you will get caught up in a life of inaction. What you want is progress, in life and career. And that can only manifest through action. Steven Pressfield writes in his book, Do The Work: Overcome Resistance and Get Out of Your Own Way,\u201cDon\u2019t think. Act. We can always revise and revisit once we\u2019ve acted. But we can accomplish nothing until we act.\u201d Do you want to know who you are? Don\u2019t ask. Act! Action will delineate and define you.\u200a\u2014\u200aThomas Jefferson Do what you should. Don\u2019t talk about what needs to be done. Be a doer. Being a Doer instead of just a Thinker requires an insane amount of discipline and commitment. Doing involves risk but it\u2019s the only way to make progress. Thomas Sterner once said, \u201cProgress is a natural result of staying focused on the process of doing anything.\u201d If you are not daring and focused enough, you can never get past the \u201cthinking\u201d stage of getting work done. Stop thinking you are at a disadvantage because of your weaknesses. If you really need to get something done, you will find a good reason why you have to pursue it otherwise your excuses will constantly convince you why it can\u2019t be done. Small deeds done are better than great deeds planned.\u200a\u2014\u200aPeter Marshall Don\u2019t over-plan and under-act! Thinking and planning in advance is important, vital in fact, to your success but acting is even more crucial to long-term achievement. If your goal is to write a book, talking to best-selling authors about writing and reading every book about writing a best-seller won\u2019t make you a writer, but the only way become a writer is to start writing. Actions you take beat life-changing intentions. Not doing anything is the same as intending to do something but never actually doing it. Does it really matter if you wanted or really intended to do something, but ended up just not doing it? Just thinking about something wont\u2019t do you any good if you don\u2019t actually do it. Every time you put something off, it\u2019s put into a queue, and nearly everything in that order of things to do may NEVER get done. You can never get real progress if you don\u2019t take action. All of the self-help articles in the world can\u2019t save you if you never take action. Every time you read a book or article like this, immediately apply something from it (no matter how big or small). Thinking about doing is more exhausting than doing. Actually, holding on to too many things to do without necessarily getting them done or taken action makes you anxious and stressed. The constant reminder that you have something to start doesn\u2019t help your wellbeing. Get started and maintain momentum. Incremental progress is better than a list of perfect ideas. Most things on your to-do list won\u2019t be done. Take them off your list or maintain the healthy habit of doing something about them everyday. Being overwhelmed with many things to do and no sense of priority (no deadlines) usually means nothing will get done. Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy.\u200a\u2014\u200aDale Carnegie What can you do right now to take even the smallest step towards achieving your most important goal on your to-do list? As you think about this question, hold the expectation that the answer will be something simple that can be done in the next 30 minutes or less. Whatever reasonable answer pops into your head, accept it and act on it immediately. Get that simple task done as quickly as you can. Sometimes you\u2019ll flow effortlessly into another task. And you will experience the \u201cfirst action effect\u201d that makes it easy to stay productive. It may take a little practice to use this strategy to consistently take action. But the benefits are enormous. Once you commit to getting started, momentum carries you. Producing results builds positive momentum. With momentum you\u2019ll get ahead and make progress much faster. Not only is doing easier than thinking about doing, but doing also gives you the ability to check something off your to-do list, giving you a sense of progress, engagement, fulfillment, and accomplishment.

But one of the most important ones for all the creatives out there is to maintain their creative passion on a day-to-day basis. A busy startup environment can be exhausting. It can drain all your creativity and shift your focus on other tasks that need your attention. It can even lead to a change of roles if there\u2019s a bigger need on a different area of the company. This can be challenging when trying to stay creative and keep your passion alive. I\u2019ve worked for four startups up to now and I know that the struggle is real. Every company has different challenges, depending on the team or the stage that they are currently in, but the ultimate question is the same, First of all, let\u2019s start with the reminder that you are responsible for your own time. Yes, there are changing priorities and targets that need to be met but it\u2019s up to you to juggle all the tasks. As challenging as it may sound, it\u2019s not impossible if you\u2019re staying away from distractions. Start by creating blocks of time during the day and focus on what matters. This way you don\u2019t lose track of what\u2019s coming up and you\u2019re able to stay on top of your priorities. Then comes the unexpected element. Working at a startup means that you need to expect the unexpected. Whether it\u2019s a positive or a negative change, there is always a new reason to leave everything that you\u2019re working on to focus on something different. It may be a sudden success or a big crisis, but the outcome is the same. You put all your effort on dealing with this and you need to leave out your perfectly planned schedule. That\u2019s when you need to top up your organisational skills. It\u2019s important to be agile enough to change your priorities and get ready to help where you\u2019re needed the most. This is a skill that\u2019s very important in a startup environment and once you start mastering it you realise that there are no surprises anymore. And then comes the creativity. If you\u2019re passionate about what you\u2019re doing and enjoy being creative, then you know how important it is to keep your craft going. Whether it\u2019s writing, designing, taking photos, or any other form of creativity, you feel the urge to maintain it despite all the struggles in your daily routine. It\u2019s not always easy to stay creative as part of a hectic startup environment, but it\u2019s not impossible. Find what works better for you and add it to your weekly routine. If you enjoy what you\u2019re doing then you need to maintain this passion. And if you\u2019re just like me, then your creative moments will easily become precious bits of your routine.

With many things in our lives constantly distracting us from being productive, I want to dive into the biggest difference between being busy and being productive and what signs to look for if you are busy but not productive. In a world where people, Organizations and Institutions are often confused on what they deliver, being busy typically becomes much easier than become productive. For example, most research supports that we have about 3\u20134 excellent working hours in us each day. Beyond that, our quality of work dissipates. I can tell you that this is an example of where theoretical research is right in reality. I teach physical education about 7\u20138 hours per day. Every day I tell my team that the classes I have for the first 4\u20135 hours of the school day get 100% of Ryan. They get a top notch educational opportunity from me in those hours. I feel \u201con\u201d, I feel alive and I feel that I am the best in the business. Simply put, I am in the \u201cflow\u201d of work. After those 4\u20135 hours, I am pretty mediocre, and I feel it. When I was a school health facilitator, if I facilitated more than a four hour workshop I needed the rest of the day and the following day to recharge the batteries. My best presentations followed my weekends and the absolute best workshops I delivered were 90 minute workshops. They were channeled, precise and full of energy. In those 4\u20135 peak hours of your day, I am assuming this is likely very similar for you. If you work a 40 hour work week and believe this is true for you I want to ask you\u200a\u2014\u200awhat are you doing with the other 2\u20133 hours a day when you are not in your peak state of work? Are you being busy or being productive? Are you stuck spending the the rest of your day trying to look busy? To feel busy? To act busy? If you answered yes to any of these, you are doing busy work and not productive work. What is the real difference between doing busy work and productive work? Many people argue different things. However, the single greatest difference between the two is passion. Why? Because any work that you do outside of what you are truly passionate about is busy work. If you are passionate about delivering the mail that is productive work, not busy work. If you are passionate about sweeping floors, you are doing productive work. If you are head of a company and hate your job because the company has recently shifted and you feel you need a change, you are now filling your days with busy work, not productive work. Productive work should be passionate work. Productive work can exist without it being passionate work. But it shouldn\u2019t. Passion and productivity should be the focal point of all your work. If that requires 4\u20135 hours of your time that is more valuable than spending 8 hours on non productive work which you are not passionate about. Here are four signs that you are doing busy work rather than productive work: When you feel like your work has to be done yet would rather be doing other, more important work\u200a\u2014\u200ayou are likely just doing busy work. Filing, editing reports and sitting in meetings all are examples of doing busy work. If it feels like it has to be done for you, it is likely busy work. Why are we having this meeting again? Why do we have to now do our reporting on this new template? Why do we have to change the way we deliver our services? If you are not sure why you are doing the work you are doing it is likely a sign that you are doing busy work, not productive work. If you are stuck doing busy work that doesn\u2019t effectively use your skills, you need to find a way out of this black hole. Nothing screams busy work when the work you are doing is under utilizing your skill set. This is pretty clear. If you feel like Fred Flintstone running as fast as you can yet not really getting anywhere fast you are likely in the arena of doing a lot of busy work. Passionate productive work will fill you. Busy work which undermines your skill set, will not fill you. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

Cardone said, You know how you repeatedly hear things but not everything clicks or has a significant meaning to you? Well, for some reason that statement really clicked for me. It actually threw me in a state of momentary panic as I calculated how much time I have been wasting. I had some things to figure out and quickly. I wrote a post the other day about how I use a schedule to help me\u00a0have\u00a0a\u00a0more\u00a0productive\u00a0day. Truth is some days, all I accomplish is time with my kids and a Medium post. Both are great and I could be like \u201cYay, for me!\u201d but it is hardly enough for the goals I am envisioning, so I don\u2019t pat myself on the back. I\u2019m also not going to have a pity party and throw the towel in because I actually want the things that I am striving for. If anyone else has made it with two kids, so can I. If anyone else has made it under your circumstances, so can you. Oftentimes, we already have the answers to our problem but we are not utilizing them. Where is there already an audience\u00a0\u2026a large Audience? This is my 19th day in a row writing on Medium. I have 1,157 views to be exact. I know, I haven\u2019t made it to the big leagues yet, but that number is significant. The majority of views came from submitting my articles to a publication. Publications are like the magazines of Medium. If you have an article that fits into the theme of a particular publication, you can submit your article and if approved, you become a writer for the publication. I\u2019ve just recently started to submit my articles but I recommend that you start submitting from the beginning. It will enable you to take advantage of the publications\u2019 larger audiences, whereas if you\u2019re new and do it on your own, it will take time to build a following. I am now submitting every article I write to a publication. #Facebook Groups I haven\u2019t started sharing my Medium posts yet, but I will be in the following weeks. I will be sharing them to Facebook groups. There are 1000's of Facebook groups with large followings. You can share blogs, videos, pictures, etc. Make sure your content is helpful and relevant to the group because though I haven\u2019t shared a post yet, I am a member of a few groups and they do not like spam. Type a keyword relevant to your niche in the search box, select \u201c groups\u201d and share away. Go to where the audience is. You will grow faster and expend less time and effort. #3 Networking Who can I help, that can also help me? Look for mutually beneficial networking opportunities. This is something I am thinking about. If I sell workout gear, I can partner with a YouTube fitness instructor. I share their workout routines, they share my gear. If I sell vegan cookbooks, I can partner with a vegan foodie. I share pictures of their delicious vegan dishes, they share my cookbook. In the preceding examples, it probably works best if you have relatively similar #\u2019s in terms of following. The idea is you both grow simultaneously via the the other\u2019s following. Mutually beneficial. Think on it. I would love to hear from you, What are some ways that you use to gain more exposure?

My favorite of the year. I didn\u2019t take this particular photograph, but I did screengrab it, meditate on it, make it my phone background. It was a picture of an Excel spreadsheet. I was up late one night a few months ago working on a profile of Claire Boucher a.k.a. Grimes and I had hit a writing impasse in the homestretch. So I cannonballed into her \u2019gram (a.k.a. dogged cultural reportage). I scrolled back a few weeks, trying not to accidentally double-tap anything at 3 a.m. (lurkers never win). And there it was. In between hair-dye selfies and a photo of a baby rhino butt: a pixelated snapshot of her laptop screen. The spreadsheet contained two columns marked \u201cengineer\u201d and \u201cproducer.\u201d Boucher had written her name in each column 13 times. There were no other names. The caption read \u201cFillin out tha paperwork.\u201d In order to know why this image hit me straight in the gut, it is important to realize that incredibly few women (at least those signed to major record deals) ever get to put out an album with such clean credits. Many women (including Boucher) have stories about not being allowed to even touch mixers in the studios, without supervision, as if their delicate lady butterfingers might slip and wreck the machines. Here are the stats: Women claim sole production credits (as in, serve as the top engineer and mastermind of) less than 5% of all albums. As Kelsey McKinney pointed out over at Fusion, this year was a particularly bad one for female musicians all around, despite the outsized optical successes of Taylor Swift and Adele and Rihanna and Katy Perry. Only 25% of the 178 songs in the Top 40 were sung by women, and there was only one song of the 178 written entirely by women without a male somehow involved in the process. No woman produced a song in the Top 40 by herself (and only 3.2% were co-produced by a woman and a man). Men run most record labels and streaming services, and the lack of respect for women trickles down right from the top: When asked about why he created Apple Music, Jimmy Iovine said, \u201cI just thought of a problem: Girls are sitting around talking about boys. Or complaining about boys, when they have their heart broken or whatever. And they need music for that, right? It\u2019s hard to find the right music. Not everybody knows a DJ.\u201d This is who is steering our cultural Death Stars. Men who believe women can\u2019t even find music, much less make it. I am glad to live in a world where girls grow up thinking that Bey has always stood perfectly still in front of \u201cFeminism\u201d in neon, a pillar of shimmering strength. This is an indelible, galvanizing image with undeniable cultural currency, and it is worth noting that Beyonce served as executive producer of her self-titled album (meaning that she had full control over hiring, marketing, and distribution strategy) and that she made a point to work with female producers in the studio. But those girls still don\u2019t often get to experience culture that comes directly to them from the mind of a woman, that only women have touched along the way, that has been made in rooms where only women have entered. This is why that Instagram lodged itself so deeply in my brain. Epiphanies are largely fabricated for mythmaking; it is only in the rear view that mundane moments reveal themselves as bolts of inspiration or breaking points. I won\u2019t claim that one grainy pic of a computer screen caused a seismic disruption in the atmosphere, but it did give me a jolt. That photo\u200a\u2014\u200aa bold, swaggering pronouncement of aesthetic autonomy by a woman working at the highest level of her art form (your personal feelings about Art Angels aside, NME and Pitchfork just named it one of the best records of the year)\u200a\u2014\u200abecame the visual shorthand for so many ideas that I had been turning over in my head. I was drawn to Boucher like a magnet because of her undeniable talent, but also because of her uncompromising, unicorn insistence on (and ultimate success in) creating her weird, wonderful, exuberant work without anyone else\u2019s help. I kept repeating it like a mantra in my head as I walked down the street: Fill out tha paperwork. I have been thinking a lot about my \u201cjob\u201d as a journalist in 2015, and how I have been repeatedly drawn to women who exercise semi-autonomous control over their own output. I spent four months watching the creators of Broad City, who edit every episode of their show themselves. I interviewed Azealia Banks, who left Universal to self-release her own album, much of which she produced in a room by herself. I talked to Melissa Rosenberg, the creator and showrunner of Jessica Jones, about making the first Marvel heroine who feels like a real woman and delivers withering clapbacks to men who have abused her and those around her. In our interview, Rosenberg shot down anyone who chose not to watch the show just because a woman was the hero: \u201cThat\u2019s called misogyny, and I\u2019m so damn tired of it.\u201d she said. I wrote about Christine and the Queens, a.k.a. Heloise Letissier, a French pop star who created her own genderless persona and who gained international fame without bowing to any of the femme requirements of most glossy marketing schemes. I talked to Dawn Richard, who has put out some of the most challenging, intricate, fluid, boundaryless R&B records (and music videos) of the past few years all on her own. I wrote about Transparent, a show where creator Jill Soloway tries to create a safe, female space on set (she called this method \u201cdiscerning-receiving\u201d in The New Yorker) and also started a bootcamp to teach inexperienced women and transgender writers who may have previously been shut out of the industry how to write TV. I have been circling the idea of women and creative work, and specifically women who make work without men involved, all year long. Optics would say that this has been a banner year for women in culture, at least in terms of representation and visibility. There\u2019s Ferrante fever. Trainwreck. \u201cBitch Better Have My Money.\u201d Adele and Taylor\u2019s monster sales. Orange is the New Black and Jessica Jones and Transparent and Broad City and UnReal and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and Empire and Inside Amy Schumer and Jane the Virgin and The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and everything that keeps beaming from Shondaland. Donna Langley runs Universal, Kathleen Kennedy runs Lucasfilm, Bonnie Hammer runs NBCUniversal, Dana Walden runs the Fox Television Group: (and women sit in the top seats at Comedy Central, BBC America, Lionsgate TV, and more). There\u2019s the towering rise of Bitch Planet. Actresses like Patricia Arquette, Jennifer Lawrence, and Jessica Chastain finally are finally speaking up about the wage gap. Kim K.\u2019s Selfish was a bestseller and an aesthetic power move. We got The Argonauts, Fates and Furies, The Witches, Lenny, \u201cOn Pandering.\u201d We now have a proliferation of slang terms for powerful groups of women who come together to plot world domination (i.e. \u201ccoven,\u201d or the slightly worse-for-the-wear \u201csquad\u201d). So sure, 2015 was \u201cgreat\u201d for women. But that statement is only true if 2015 marks the last year in which things can be so very bad. If this year somehow magically marks the end of women being widely shut out of cultural production, paid significantly less than their peers, and rarely given the chance or financial backing to create mainstream art without male interventions in the process, then I will feel ready to celebrate 2015. But I am inclined to save my champagne. The numbers in music are garbage, but they are even worse in Hollywood. The numbers there are so bad (or, to quote Manohla Dargis, \u201cimmoral, borderline illegal\u201d) I can\u2019t decide if I should laugh or burn things down. This year, women directed only 5% of all studio films and directed only 16% of all television episodes (in the 2013\u201314 season, 70 shows hired no women at all). The number of women writers on TV staffs dropped from 30.5% to 29%. The numbers are even more condemnable when it comes to women of color; in the 2014\u201315 television season, for example, women of color directed only 3% of all episodes. There are powerful women of color working in film and television as directors and showrunners\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as Ava DuVernay, Gina Prince-Bythewood, Shonda Rhimes, Mindy Kaling, and Dee Rees\u200a\u2014\u200abut their ranks are few and the obstacles they face are tremendous. Earlier this year, DuVernay made a public call on Twitter for her followers to name films with strong minority women leads that were directed by women, and found they could name only a few. How is this acceptable? How are we not tearing down marquees, bum rushing red carpets? This year, all of the Best Director nominees will be male, and so a man will walk up to the podium and thank everyone who got him his statue. But what he should say is that he is embarrassed to win in a category where he essentially only competed against himself. The answer might be, and increasingly seems to be, looking outside the mainstream for more authentic voices, but also, the mainstream is where the money is. This is all, always, always about economics. And I want women to be paid. I want women to be paid as much as men are paid, to make things, to experiment, to get to fail and fail again, to get their ideas directly to the public. \u201cI get rejected about 700 times a day, no question,\u201d says Dawn Richard, about the double-edged sword of being a woman who chooses to create work on her own without a built-in support system. \u201cFrom labels, bookers, publicists, journalists, every day. Because I reach out myself. I like my fuck-ups because they turn into these really really cool mistakes. We\u2019re imperfect and that shit is beautiful.\u201d Here\u2019s a little story about why it is important for women to control the means of cultural production: During one of our interviews, Boucher talked to me about how most of her songs begin with a kind of girlish glossolalia that pours out of her late at night in her home studio. They are sounds she says she does not feel she would make if she was in the classic studio setting, where \u201cthere\u2019s like 20 guys and everyone\u2019s drunk.\u201d When you listen to Art Angels, you hear the traces of this early vocalise; her falsetto trills or feral growls. These whimsical flourishes, and the eccentric beats she lays them over, are what make the record work; they are its beating heart. She just doesn\u2019t sound like anyone else. This is important not only on a technical level but also in terms of who ends up receiving the final accolades. Currently, even if a woman produces the majority of her record, if a man is somehow involved in the process, the media often refers to him as the architect of the sound. Earlier this year, Bjork addressed her frustration with this phenomenon, saying that though she made most of her beats herself, her male co-producers gets to bask in the acclaim. \u201cI did 80 percent of the beats on Vespertine and it took me three years to work on that album\u2026Matmos came in the last two weeks and added percussion on top of the songs, but they didn\u2019t do any of the main parts, and they are credited everywhere as having done the whole album.\u201d So even when women do get to touch the equipment, male intervention can end up undoing the public perception of their work. For Boucher, her insistence on working alone is the reason she insists doesn\u2019t make pop songs\u2014 \u201cPop music is made by teams of people,\u201d she told me. \u201cI make independent music. Not just because I want to exist in the alternative, but because I think it\u2019s important not to be artistically indebted to anybody if you want to stand for something. I want people to start thinking of me like Trent Reznor.\u201d She needs the pathway between her creative vision and her listener to remain clear and uncluttered. She brought in only the pinch-hitters she wanted to collaborate with, including Janelle Monae (who is one of the only women currently operating her own independent record label attached to a major label) and the petite Taiwanese rapper Aristophanes, who Boucher flew to the United States for the first time to perform in front of a sold-out crowd in New York City. She also launched her own small label, which she calls a \u201ccollective,\u201d and she brought her first signee, an underground songwriter named Nicole Dollanganger, on tour with her across the country (a tour where she performs on stage flanked by two female backup dancers and no one else). Boucher is harnessing her energy to signal boost other women, which is even another, higher level of changing the game. Of course, the thread of her artistry is lost when people write about her; it becomes more about how she managed to make what she made as a woman at all. (And see, I\u2019ve already fallen prey to it! The internalizing is real.) Women who are paid to create culture are often taught to remain separate from one another because they are breathing rarefied air; don\u2019t disturb the atmosphere. And while I want women to control their own production and do it totally on their own if they have to, the idea of the Lone Female Genius is also holding us back: we need to work together if we are going to topple anything. When women are isolated, they compete instead of conspire. And women should be conspiring! (If that sounds scary, welcome to a double standard; when brilliant men work together, people make documentaries about it. When two or more smart women know each other, it becomes a nefarious secret scheme). Collaboration is an essential part of getting work out into the world that not only feels authentic, but truly intersectional. Statistics show that women creators, when given total control over their budgets and hiring, tend to hire other women; they fill their sets and studios with female teams. On Empire, showrunner Ilene Chaiken actively recruits women of color to direct episodes, including those who have little to no previous directing experience but have shown exceptional promise. Of this initiative, she said, \u201cIt matters because they\u2019re telling culturally specific stories\u2026It\u2019s also about the feeling on the set, about the interaction with the cast and the sense that this is a show that\u2019s being made by people who are equally invested in the stories they\u2019re telling.\u201d I interviewed Viola Davis before and after her mic-dropping Emmy speech this year, and she echoed the idea that women of color must control their own narratives (and oversee their own projects) to ensure authentic representation on screen: \u201cNow that I\u2019m producing, I\u2019m seeing what\u2019s happening behind the scenes with people like Alfre Woodard, with people like Sanaa Lathan, with Taraji P. Henson, with Kerry Washington. These are all women who are producing their own material. They know their beauty, they know their talent. The women I know don\u2019t accept the statistics anymore. They don\u2019t accept the numbers as cementing their future.\u201d I want these and other ambitious women to be able to make the work that they want, at the scale that they want. I believe that idiosyncratic, intimate storytelling from women is vital, but it is also important for women to control the production of our broad cultural mythology, the big narratives (and big budgets) that captivate wide swaths of viewers all at once. This year, with Creed, director Ryan Coogler proved what happens when a fresh outsider voice gets the keys to a major Hollywood franchise; he made a boxing film from a singular black perspective that didn\u2019t cater to white audiences but also didn\u2019t exclude them. The next step is pushing the studios (be it via public shaming or ACLU probes) to give the golden blockbuster keys to a non-male. The closest we got this year to a woman taking on a franchise property was Marvel\u2019s Jessica Jones, and there is a lot that can be said for its success. Jessica Jones languished at ABC before landing at Netflix; ABC just couldn\u2019t see how to make a mainstream show that featured a wounded woman who was also a superhero who was also a mental case who was also an advocate for abuse victims and the rights of battered women all across New York City. But Netflix gave Melissa Rosenberg runway to make what she wanted (at least as much runway as a woman who makes a show for Marvel, which employs mostly men, can wrestle for herself). What came out was the first show in memory that featured a female protagonist with inherently radical feminist aims (she needed to destroy her rapist, a mind-controller who was terrorizing the city as a fragile white male who just wanted to be loved; very au-courant), but that wasn\u2019t talked about only as a show for women. It got to be deliciously dark, twisty, utterly violent. The female gaze was all over the frame (just look at how Luke Cage glistens with his shirt off), but men didn\u2019t seem to mind it. They allowed their reality be suspended for a moment, and women finally allowed theirs to come to life on screen; what women saw, what I saw, was a dark journey into the heart of a woman who has been threatened so much that she decided that there was no other choice than to fight back. But a woman doesn\u2019t have to take on a superhero to be effective in the mainstream. Look at what can be achieved when a woman focuses on a more personal mythology: Soloway\u2019s Transparent feels like no other show on television (or the web). It has a different kind of energy that most shows, one that is both softer and more direct. It slips in and out of dream sequences, haunting musical motifs, sentimentality shoved up against identity politics. (Some transgender activists have lamented that while her show provides opportunities for trans actors and writers, it is also run by a woman who is not trans, and who is telling their story for them. This is a problem, but Soloway has at least been open to this critique; it is also important that we are moving towards a world where trans women own their own cultural production.) This season featured sex between women over 70, full-frontal mastectomy scars, open conversations about gender reassignment, a woman wearing a strap-on, a lesbian dominatrix, and a three-minute scene where a group of naked, uninhibited women danced around in the woods like giddy nymphs to an Indigo Girls song. As a woman watching this, my jaw kept dropping. How does this show keep reflecting back to me the way I have actually felt, what is this alchemy? And this flash of recognition immediately made me sad: How moving it is to feel like you can meld with the screen, how deeply this mirroring affects you and changes the way you feel for long hours. I realize how rarely I feel this way, the way that men must feel all the time. As a final note, I should add a disclaimer here: this piece is being edited by a man. This is a caveat I could slap on a lot of my work, but I never do\u200a\u2014\u200anot because I have anything to hide, but because I have never really thought to reveal it, it is such a common occurrence in my writing life. My editor runs this publication, which means that he has the top edit on this piece, he says which words will get published, in which order; the piece and the publication live on a platform founded by another man. This is not a complaint: my editor on this piece is one of the good ones. He listens to me and we have long, thoughtful discussions about my ideas; he actively pushes me to be more rigorous and expansive, and he usually lets me win when it comes to haggling over syntax and structure. He trusts me, and I have learned that I can trust him. He shields me from any pressures coming at him from above (you\u2019d be surprised at how many editors do not do this)\u200a\u2014\u200ahe doesn\u2019t talk to me about pageviews or whether or not he thinks a certain quote will go viral. He gives me freedom to write what I want to, office space to do so when I need it, and the competitive word rate I asked for. This is a pretty idyllic editor-writer relationship, and I am fortunate to have it. Still, about nine out of the 10 editors I usually work with are men (or more accurately, they self-identify as cisgender males). This tends to be the breakdown of most women I talk with who do the kind of writing that I do. And, in the spirit of Fillin Out Tha Paperwork, I have begun grappling with this ratio. I have become slightly obsessed with it. This is not a new feeling\u200a\u2014\u200amany have been clocking the lack of female top editors at general interest publications since I began writing for them\u200a\u2014\u200abut lately I see the broader effects of it. I have been thinking about how my work might have been different\u200a\u2014\u200amight be different\u200a\u2014\u200aif I wasn\u2019t always aware that, at the final moment between me and publication, a man could swoop in and make changes. I like to think that this knowledge doesn\u2019t affect what I write or how I write it, that I am unflappably myself at all times, compromising my voice for no one. But then I think, maybe I have stopped myself from growling into the microphone because I knew it wouldn\u2019t fly. I wrote about all the powerful women and their cultural output I mentioned earlier for male editors, and did not feel encumbered doing it. But I also did not get to write about many women that I wanted to, that I thought were important this year, because the editors I pitched them to didn\u2019t see their cultural value (and these were not obscure women, but some of the biggest names of the past 20 years). And it isn\u2019t always intentional: these editors are serving their publications and their editorial missions; they have jobs to do. But I also understand acutely after several years of writing and pitching how difficult it can be to place stories about certain types of women in general interest publications, and I have to believe that it has something to do with the gender breakdown of the editors at the very top (spoiler: mostly dudes). The editor of this piece turned down a story on one of the biggest female girl groups of the \u201990s who was trying for a comeback this year (and who provided the teenage soundtrack for most women I know). \u201cToo nostalgic,\u201d was the decree. For men, maybe. This is how the filter works. So it all comes down, again, to money and autonomy: women need to be in charge. Women need to be in charge. At least half the time. Our culture suffers when this doesn\u2019t happen. And it is my job, it is all our jobs, to keep shouting this over and over and over and over until we start to see some movement. And not just say something, but do something. Start filling out the paperwork. Last month, I posed a question on Twitter about which women in culture people wish could get free reign to make whatever they want. I got hundreds of responses covering all categories of creativity: illustrators, game designers, playwrights, comedians, cinematographers and choreographers. The hunger for unfettered creativity to spill into our laps is there, it is real. For my part, I want to start something of my own in 2016; to create the culture instead of just write about it, and to do so in collaboration with other women whose brains are on fire. I am seeing now that this is the only way forward. And this is why, after looking at all the numbers and finding them terrifying, I have hope for the year to come. As women become more and more visible, they need to not only be their own top liners but also bring other women along for the ride: Imagine the first pop star at Swift\u2019s level to make a record untouched by men, or the first woman to make a network show with an all-female set. Those will be good days. We are hopefully moving towards those days. But until we are there, we have to keep talking until there is nothing left to say. We have to make this the Last Bad Year.

You most likely don\u2019t, and you probably don\u2019t remember what you spent it on either. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going out on a limb by assuming that you didn\u2019t put it in a mutual fund or donate part of it to charity. Wise use of money doesn\u2019t always come naturally, but it\u2019s necessary for startup founders. Before co-founding technology company Zdi, I spent over a decade as an analyst, project manager, and operations director. I was also surrounded by a team and given room to experiment and learn\u200a\u2014\u200ait was like a financial test lab. Startup founders rarely have the benefit of a strong team, a decade of experience in related fields, and enough room to learn from trial and error, which is why many struggle financially. Founders without financial management skills often see the first round of investment set on fire (not literally). It\u2019s important to note that no product, service, or highly funded and promising startup is above failing because of financial mistakes. Large, highly respected companies burn through money and make gigantic mistakes just as often as startups do\u200a\u2014\u200ahowever, it\u2019s easier for large companies to recover. With a $4.8B pool of debt, Netflix has already spent around $6B on new content in 2017. Will it pay off? Possibly for a company the size of Netflix, but this type of gamble is far less likely to work for a startup. Here\u2019s an example of how startups often go right through their first round of investment with little to show for it: Company X has a fantastic idea for a product-based business, and they are interested in fundraising. With a young but solid team to build the first prototype, they are able to convince others that this idea is worth investing in, and they land a few hundred thousand dollars in investment. They now have the money they believe they need to build their product, which they\u2019re sure will be a hit with their future customers. What could go wrong? The answer is everything\u200a\u2014\u200aeverything can still go wrong. There are several mistakes common among startups that can\u2019t be avoided by throwing additional money at them. No gigantic sum of money can overcome the devastating impact of: You will always make decisions that don\u2019t work out, but understanding and learning from bad decisions is much more important for you and your company than a single good or bad decision. For example, you may purchase a piece of software or an online subscription that\u2019s either never used again after the first week or is just a bad fit for what you want to accomplish with it. Learning why your decision didn\u2019t work will save your company time and money and keep your team focused on the tasks that matter instead of wasting time trying to implement software that isn\u2019t going to bring value to your startup. Your plan for your company will guide your decisions, for better or for worse. If there is no plan in place, you don\u2019t have a reason to say no to a seemingly good deal or opportunity. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019ve just been offered a 40% discount on your next $10,000 of advertising with AdWords. While this may be a great deal, if you\u2019ve already exceeded your marketing budget for the month, you should pass. But if you don\u2019t have a marketing plan in place, and you\u2019re making decisions based on instinct or how good a deal is, you\u2019re more than likely to accept a \u201cgood deal\u201d and not learn until later that you\u2019re overspending on marketing. Amazing ideas and brilliant inventions will still fail if there isn\u2019t a market that is ready to buy what you\u2019re selling. Google Glass and the Segway are just two of millions of examples of products that didn\u2019t have markets ready to adopt them into daily life. If you don\u2019t have a product/market fit, every dollar you spend on advertising, marketing, and sales may be a complete waste. Make sure those you\u2019re targeting with your product or service are compelled and ready to buy from you. Unless your startup is creating an entirely new market, you are competing against talented and experienced companies for the same customers. To succeed, your startup has to have a high-functioning team with the right employees in place, great mentors, and the ability to find and recruit talent as you grow. A bad hire does more damage to your company than simply waste money\u200a\u2014\u200ait can slow or stall your growth, while a great hire can speed up your growth and increase your overall chances of success. If you want to avoid burning through your first round of investment, it will take extensive planning and executing on that plan, along with avoiding the common mistakes and potential roadblocks mentioned above. Here are a few articles I would recommend reading related to raising your first round of investment, budgeting, and how to avoid common pitfalls.

Reading is the best way to rapidly gain a deep, and broad understanding of a topic or discipline. You can read an entire book every day but it will cost you. It\u2019s a massive goal and can be unreasonable but it works for me. I am selective about the books I choose to speed read. I look out for the most important ideas in each book. Ideas that can advance my long-term goals. I don\u2019t read when I am \u201cin the mood\u201d because that\u2019s unpredictable. I read everywhere when I have even 5 minutes. It\u2019s super convenient to pull out my phone ( I keep it in airplane mode and avoid all notifications) and read a paragraph or two when I can. Some books can be read just once, providing instant gratification, and then you feel you can pass them on to somebody else. Others will require more from you. The question is, how much are you willing to put into them? Whether you are looking to improve yourself or learn something new, it\u2019s possible to read a book in a single day. Patrick Allan of Lifehacker explains why reading a book every day is a realistic goal, if you are prepared to put in the hours. If you like to read, odds are you\u2019ve got a stack of books you\u2019ve been meaning to get to, but haven\u2019t been able to find the time. But, starting today, you can change your reading habit. When you aim to understand an author, it won\u2019t take you too long to read an entire book. Understanding a book is the best way to read it quickly. Once you know and understand the author\u2019s message, you will be able to read it faster, learn from it and move on to the next one. Sir Francis Bacon once said, \u201cSome books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested: that is, some books are to be read only in parts, others to be read, but not curiously, and some few to be read wholly, and with diligence and attention\u201d Don\u2019t read all your books with the same mindset. Choose books with purpose for speed reading. You can\u2019t use any book for this purpose. Enjoying books are no different than enjoying a TV show or a movie. If you don\u2019t like a show, you won\u2019t waste your time starting it in the first place. If you want to give it a chance, you will try watching the first episode. If you don\u2019t really like a book, you will stop reading it and start read something else. It\u2019s important you select your book carefully. Find a reason to read. It could be self-improvement, better utilization of time, learning things, improving your career etc. Learn to speed read. Using your peripheral vision allows you to read with fewer eye fixations because your vision span is wider and you can see, read, and process more words at a time. When you use your peripheral vision to read, you look in the space between two words instead of looking the specific word, trying to read both words and then moving your eyes to the next pair of words. Michael Benninger of Blinklist explains: Read in clumps. A clump is a collection of 4 to 16 adjacent words that you read in a single glance. When you read in clumps, you naturally increase your speed because you can\u2019t slow down to vocalize (speak or hear the words as you read them). Once you\u2019ve taught yourself to speed read at a decent pace, and have some books you want to work through, you need an ideal reading environment. Distraction is everywhere. Separate yourself from everything that distracts you. Think of how much solitude you\u2019ll need, then double it. Go somewhere that can guarantee the solitude you want. Use headphones, if you have to. Listen to white noise. It will help you keep focused, and read little faster. If you\u2019re really short on time, and sitting isn\u2019t an option, you can choose an audiobook. You can read for a couple of hours, download the audiobook and listen to it while you drive, shop, on break, do house chores, or when exercising. You can listen at different speeds to finish quicker. You can always return to your book once you have everything done. If you have a commute, use it. If you have a lunch break, use that. Waiting in line? Read. Eliminate one hour of television a day if you have to. The long-term benefits cannot be compared with the short-term pleasure of daily distractions. This advice from Peter Bregman has made a lot of difference for me. He originally shared it on HBR. The entire post is worth a read: This advice will not work for fiction books but for others that seek to get an idea or arguement across to readers, you can apply it. When you intend to burn through a book in a single day, you\u2019ll naturally forget things. Have a way to take notes! Taking notes along the way is very helpful. Or stay active by highlighting passages. You don\u2019t have to finish a book every day, but if you are keen to significantly improve how you read, start slowly. Don\u2019t be too harsh on yourself if you can\u2019t read an entire book in a single day. It takes practice. Pick up something you can relate to or enjoy. And then explore & experiment. That will motivate you to read tomorrow and beyond. Now grab the book you want to read and go to town. I have recommended a few books in the past here here, here and here.

You take an idea and you paint a picture that makes sense to them in a meaningful way and they get it. In response, they might tell you that you are good with words. Empathy opens you up to better communication because empathy is being able to take the perspective of another and think, feel, & act as if you are them. As you communicate, you are communicating to someone else, so when you inhabit their mind and see the world from their perspective (the empathic process called, you guessed it, \u201cPerspective Taking\u201d), you are able to adapt your communication to what will be most effective for the transaction. This is further defined by two applications of empathy called \u201cAttribution\u201d + \u201cAccommodation\u201d. You attribute a perspective to the person receiving your communication by stepping into their shoes\u200a\u2014\u200ayou take their perspective. Once you begin seeing the world from their eyes, you can now make some attributions about where they are, what they want, and how they need something conveyed. That is step 1, gathering the information of where your audience or recipient is and how they will best receive your message\u2026but you still need to do something with that information. You accommodate what you want to say, do, or pass on to what you have attributed as the state of your audience or recipient\u200a\u2014\u200ayou adapt your behavior & communication to their perspective that you have taken into account. This is why a solid vocabulary or a depth to your content or wisdom is helpful\u200a\u2014\u200abecause the more language, ideas, & information you have to operate from, the more options you have to fit the communicative needs of the other. A couple steps to take you through this process: You can\u2019t simply grasp for any word to make a point, you must be able to use the best, most specific & implicit set of words that is within your arsenal that will make the most sense to the other. This is why the empathy part is important. If you use the word you prefer to use, you are banking on the assumption that it makes just as much sense to them. But if you can understand their perspective, you can carefully choose words that fit into their communicative state. This intentionality is applicable to any situation where you are going to communicate something to someone else. Ask, \u201cWhat communication do they need?\u201d based on your attribution and accommodation and be intentional about using whatever answer you get to that question\u200a\u2014\u200awhether they are your preference or not. In putting yourself in your audience\u2019s perspective and adapting accordingly, we must remember that communication is not just the words you use\u200a\u2014\u200ait is anything that passes on a message or information to a recipient. Communicating empathically, then, is not just about adapting to what your audience needs to hear, but also: You need to ask all of these questions and anticipate the best crafted message in response. If communication is more than just words, this would mean you have to consider: Empathic communication is not just adapting your language, it is considering all of the variables for what happens when you send a message. First, your audience will never hear or take in every single word. You most likely have not memorized or even paid attention to every word written in this article. Therefore, you don\u2019t have to worry about every word, right? Actually, I\u2019d argue it is the opposite. Every word, every compositional choice, every detail must be intentional. This is why poets are the best communicators\u200a\u2014\u200athey are working with certain constraints that make every word necessary & important. Poor composition, ineffective words, or distracting content will lead to an audience determining an amateur-ness to the messenger\u2026which will lead to the conscious decision that this message isn\u2019t worth their time. Pour over every detail like a poet\u200a\u2014\u200aeven though every detail might not be appreciated to the same extent you appreciate them, it will create a flow that will determine how the audience judges to engage whatever you are producing. I\u2019ve tried to do this, but only you, the audience, can determine if the attempt is successful or not. This whole concept can come across as a demand to forget about yourself in the communicative process and just play to other people to get what you want or give them what they want. Not true. For certain personalities, if you go this direction, it can be really unhealthy. But here is what is most important: Essentially, if you don\u2019t know who you are, what you need, what you have to offer, the vocabulary that you have gathered up, or the essence of what you bring to the table\u200a\u2014\u200ayour communication will always be a shallow effort to appease and will be less effective. You can\u2019t lose yourself in empathy\u200a\u2014\u200aempathy should produce the most effective version of yourself in the messages you craft. Call if self-awareness or \u201cknowing thyself\u201d (to thine own self be true), but whether you are a leader or you are in a relationship, whatever content you communicate must be an accurate reflection of what is inside you. Only then can you properly & healthily adapt to your audience. This also brings up an important point that goes along with \u201cCreating Like a Poet\u201d: You pour over every word, even if good content could be produced by putting in less effort, because you are also receiving what you produce. You go through the process of self-empathy because, whatever your create, even if it is intended for someone else, will also be received by you. In creating a message, you will be changed\u2026always keep that in mind. This is why speakers are encouraged to \u201cknow your audience\u201d. You have a room full of people, but I\u2019m assuming the gathered group is not a random or unbiased selection. So under the disposition of what you know about your audience\u200a\u2014\u200athe more you can adapt your communication, the more effective the transmission will be. Ask all of the above communicative questions about your audience in crafting a message that you are going to be publicly giving: The more you utilize empathy and you accommodate, the more effective your communication will be in a large group or public setting. There are an infinite number of ways you can say what you want to say\u200a\u2014\u200afrom the content of your words to the composition of your content to images and graphics that can visually aid your message. [ use the questions above to help ] This is why many writers resort to clickbait-y titles or seem to be selling the seven ideas / secrets / tools to make you successful / happy / better. Because those authors understand that people want to be those things and, while I don\u2019t agree with that use of empathy\u200a\u2014\u200athe one that uses another\u2019s perspective to get them to do what I want (this is called manipulation\u2026and it takes someone clever & empathic to manipulate)\u200a\u2014\u200ait does accomplish their goal via empathy. It is the same with Mass Media (this is what makes marketing so effective\u200a\u2014\u200athey are manipulating you by using your own perspective to sell their stuff). Just thinking through what specific words you should be using and how you should map out your ideas to be best received by the person on the other end of those words will make your communication more effective. Considering the perspective of your potential audience will alter how you craft a post. If you only consider yourself in how you communicate online, we can all tell\u2026and we will also probably not read what you put out there. Each platform also has its unique benefits\u200a\u2014\u200aYou shouldn\u2019t post to Twitter the same way you post to Facebook or the same way you post to Instagram. Message size & the immediacy of the content, its visibility, and its pragmatic value, though, are the most important aspects for social media because of the competition of the individual\u2019s most valuable resources\u200a\u2014\u200aawareness, attention, and time. Not to mention that social media is designed to encourage individuals to scroll\u2026to only give their resources to the content that they want. Your content should reflect the competition for these limited resources. I\u2019ll leave this brief (foreshadowing what empathic communication should do to our meetings). There is one dynamic of sitting across the table from someone and adapting the conversation as you go\u200a\u2014\u200aknowing what questions, information, or content is most applicable to the individual(s) that are present. There is another dynamic that is much more applicable in corporate or organizational settings. Empathy will probably lead to your meetings being shorter. Empathy should guide your communication especially in your relationships. Can you sit across the table from someone and simply ask: You aren\u2019t just communicating with yourself in your relationships\u200a\u2014\u200athe other person\u2019s being needs to be accounted for. Or just in general, have you considered the frequency of your communication in collaboration with what the other needs? Or the timing of what you say? Or the non-verbals you communicate when you are standing in the room together? You can\u2019t take people where they don\u2019t want to go; which means you need to know where they are and lead them to where they need to go (which may be different from where they want to go). Trust is essential in leadership and you are much more likely to build trust if you are in tune with the minds, hearts, and contexts of who you are working with. Attributing and accommodating are more important than ever in the field of Leadership. If you lead something, constantly be in tune with how the stakeholders, consumers, & co-workers see, feel, & experience the world. You can have great content, but if you don\u2019t utilize empathy\u200a\u2014\u200aif you ignore your audience\u200a\u2014\u200athere is a chance that your content will be un-relatable to everyone. There is a chance that you won\u2019t have an audience. Whenever you communicate, use empathy. Take the perspective of the other and adapt every part of your messages accordingly. Your communication will be better. If you\u2019re interested, I\u2019d be happy to share what I\u2019m finding to help craft how you live, too.

I meet Wouter by chance at a random cafe in the center of Amsterdam. It is a sunny day and almost all the tables are occupied. Some people talk, others are working on their laptops or playing with their smartphones. Wouter removes his laptop from his backpack, puts the black device on the table, and hides it under a menu. A waitress passes by and we ask for two coffees and the password for the WiFi network. Meanwhile, Wouter switches on his laptop and device, launches some programs, and soon the screen starts to fill with green text lines. It gradually becomes clear that Wouter\u2019s device is connecting to the laptops, smartphones, and tablets of cafe visitors. On his screen, phrases like \u201ciPhone Joris\u201d and \u201cSimone\u2019s MacBook\u201d start to appear. The device\u2019s antenna is intercepting the signals that are being sent from the laptops, smartphones, and tablets around us. More text starts to appear on the screen. We are able to see which WiFi networks the devices were previously connected to. Sometimes the names of the networks are composed of mostly numbers and random letters, making it hard to trace them to a definite location, but more often than not, these WiFi networks give away the place they belong to. We learn that Joris had previously visited McDonald\u2019s, probably spent his vacation in Spain (lots of Spanish-language network names), and had been kart-racing (he had connected to a network belonging to a well-known local kart-racing center). Martin, another caf\u00e9 visitor, had been logged on to the network of Heathrow airport and the American airline Southwest. In Amsterdam, he\u2019s probably staying at the White Tulip Hostel. He had also paid a visit to a coffee shop called The Bulldog. The waitress serves us our coffee and hands us the WiFi password. After Slotboom is connected, he is able to provide all the visitors with an internet connection and to redirect all internet traffic through his little device. Most smartphones, laptops, and tablets automatically search and connect to WiFi networks. They usually prefer a network with a previously established connection. If you have ever logged on to the T-Mobile network on the train, for example, your device will search for a T-Mobile network in the area. Slotboom\u2019s device is capable of registering these searches and appearing as that trusted WiFi network. I suddenly see the name of my home network appear on my iPhone\u2019s list of available networks, as well as my workplace, and a list of cafes, hotel lobbies, trains, and other public places I\u2019ve visited. My phone automatically connects itself to one of these networks, which all belong to the black device. Slotboom can also broadcast a fictitious network name, making users believe they are actually connecting to the network of the place they\u2019re visiting. For example, if a place has a WiFi network consisting of random letters and numbers (Fritzbox xyz123), Slotboom is able to provide the network name (Starbucks). People, he says, are much more willing to connect to these. We see more and more visitors log on to our fictitious network. The siren song of the little black device appears to be irresistible. Already 20 smartphones and laptops are ours. If he wanted to, Slotboom could now completely ruin the lives of the people connected: He can retrieve their passwords, steal their identity, and plunder their bank accounts. Later today, he will show me how. I have given him permission to hack me in order to demonstrate what he is capable of, though it could be done to anyone with a smartphone in search of a network, or a laptop connecting to a WiFi network. Everything, with very few exceptions, can be cracked. The idea that public WiFi networks are not secure is not exactly news. It is, however, news that can\u2019t be repeated often enough. There are currently more than 1.43 billion smartphone users worldwide and more than 150 million smartphone owners in the U.S. More than 92 million American adults own a tablet and more than 155 million own a laptop. Each year the worldwide demand for more laptops and tablets increases. In 2013, an estimated 206 million tablets and 180 million laptops were sold worldwide. Probably everyone with a portable device has once been connected to a public WiFi network: while having a coffee, on the train, or at a hotel. The good news is that some networks are better protected than others; some email and social media services use encryption methods that are more secure than their competitors. But spend a day walking in the city with Wouter Slotboom, and you\u2019ll find that almost everything and everyone connected to a WiFi network can be hacked. A study from threat intelligence consultancy Risk Based Security estimates that more than 822 million records were exposed worldwide in 2013, including credit card numbers, birth dates, medical information, phone numbers, social security numbers, addresses, user names, emails, names, and passwords. Sixty-five percent of those records came from the U.S. According to IT security firm Kaspersky Lab, in 2013 an estimated 37.3 million users worldwide and 4.5 million Americans were the victim of phishing\u2014or pharming\u2014attempts, meaning payment details were stolen from hacked computers, smartphones, or website users. Report after report shows that digital identity fraud is an increasingly common problem. Hackers and cybercriminals currently have many different tricks at their disposal. But the prevalence of open, unprotected WiFi networks does make it extremely easy for them. The Netherlands National Cyber \u200b\u200bSecurity Center, a division of the Ministry of Security and Justice, did not issue the following advice in vain: \u201cIt is not advisable to use open WiFi networks in public places. If these networks are used, work or financial related activities should better be avoided.\u201d Slotboom calls himself an \u201cethical hacker,\u201d or one of the good guys; a technology buff who wants to reveal the potential dangers of the internet and technology. He advises individuals and companies on how to better protect themselves and their information. He does this, as he did today, usually by demonstrating how easy it is to inflict damage. Because really, it\u2019s child\u2019s play: The device is cheap, and the software for intercepting traffic is very easy to use and is readily available for download. \u201cAll you need is 70 Euros, an average IQ, and a little patience,\u201d he says. I will refrain from elaborating on some of the more technical aspects, such as equipment, software, and apps needed to go about hacking people. Armed with Slotboom\u2019s backpack, we move to a coffeehouse that is known for the beautiful flowers drawn in the foam of the lattes, and as a popular spot for freelancers working on laptops. This place is now packed with people concentrating on their screens. Slotboom switches on his equipment. He takes us through the same steps, and within a couple of minutes, 20 or so devices are connected to ours. Again we see their Mac-addresses and login history, and in some cases their owners\u2019 names. At my request, we now go a step further. Slotboom launches another program (also readily available for download), which allows him to extract even more information from the connected smartphones and laptops. We are able to see the specifications of the mobile phone models (Samsung Galaxy S4), the language settings for the different devices, and the version of the operating system used (iOS 7.0.5). If a device has an outdated operating system, for example, there are always known \u201cbugs,\u201d or holes in the security system that can be easily exploited. With this kind of information, you have what you need to break into the operating system and take over the device. A sampling of the coffeehouse customers reveals that none of the connected devices have the latest version of the operating system installed. For all these legacy systems, a known bug is listed online. We can now see some of the actual internet traffic of those around us. We see that someone with a MacBook is browsing the site Nu.nl. We can see that many devices are sending documents using WeTransfer, some are connecting to Dropbox, and some show activity on Tumblr. We see that someone has just logged on to FourSquare. The name of this person is also shown, and, after googling his name, we recognize him as the person sitting just a few feet away from us. Information comes flooding in, even from visitors who are not actively working or surfing. Many email programs and apps constantly make contact with their servers\u2014a necessary step for a device to retrieve new emails. For some devices and programs, we are able to see what information is being sent, and to which server. And now it\u2019s getting really personal. We see that one visitor has the gay dating app Grindr installed on his smartphone. We also see the name and type of the smartphone he\u2019s using (iPhone 5s). We stop here, but it would be a breeze to find out to who the phone belongs to. We also see that someone\u2019s phone is attempting to connect to a server in Russia, sending the password along with it, which we are able to intercept. Many apps, programs, websites, and types of software make use of encryption technologies. These are there to ensure that the information sent and received from a device is not accessible to unauthorized eyes. But once the user is connected to Slotboom\u2019s WiFi network, these security measures can be circumvented relatively easily, with the help of decryption software. To our shared surprise, we see an app sending personal information to a company that sells online advertising. Among other things, we see the location data, technical information of the phone, and information of the WiFi network. We can also see the name (first and last) of a woman using the social bookmarking website Delicious. Delicious allows users to share websites\u2014bookmarks\u2014they are interested in. In principle, the pages that users of Delicious share are available publicly, yet we can\u2019t help feeling like voyeurs when we realize just how much we are able to learn about this woman on the basis of this information. First we google her name, which immediately allows us to determine what she looks like and where in the coffeehouse she is sitting. We learn that she was born in a different European country and only recently moved to the Netherlands. Through Delicious we discover that she\u2019s been visiting the website of a Dutch language course and she has bookmarked a website with information on the Dutch integration course. In less than 20 minutes, here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned about the woman sitting 10 feet from us: where she was born, where she studied, that she has an interest in yoga, that she\u2019s bookmarked an online offer for a anti-snore mantras, recently visited Thailand and Laos, and shows a remarkable interest in sites that offer tips on how to save a relationship. Slotboom shows me some more hacker tricks. Using an app on his phone, he is able to change specific words on any website. For example, whenever the word \u201cOpstelten\u201d (the name of a Dutch politician) is mentioned, people see the word \u201cDutroux\u201d (the name of a convicted serial killer) rendered on the page instead. We tested it and it works. We try another trick: Anyone loading a website that includes pictures gets to see a picture selected by Slotboom. This all sounds funny if you\u2019re looking for some mischief, but it also makes it possible to load images of child pornography on someone\u2019s smartphone, the possession of which is a criminal offense. We visit yet another cafe. My last request to Slotboom is to show me what he would do if he wanted to really harm me. He asks me to go to Live.com (the Microsoft email site) and enter a random username and password. A few seconds later, the information I just typed appears on his screen. \u201cNow I have the login details of your email account,\u201d Slotboom says. \u201cThe first thing I would do is change the password of your account and indicate to other services you use that I have forgotten my password. Most people use the same email account for all services. And those new passwords will then be sent to your mailbox, which means I will have them at my disposal as well.\u201d We do the same for Facebook: Slotboom is able to intercept the login name and password I entered with relative ease. Another trick that Slotboom uses is to divert my internet traffic. For example, whenever I try to access the webpage of my bank, he has instructed his program to re-direct me to a page he owns: a cloned site that appears to be identical to the trusted site, but is in fact completely controlled by Slotboom. Hackers call this DNS spoofing. The information I entered on the site is stored on the server owned by Slotboom. Within 20 minutes he\u2019s obtained the login details, including passwords for my Live.com, SNS Bank, Facebook, and DigiD accounts. I will never again be connecting to an insecure public WiFi network without taking security measures. This article originally appeared in Dutch online journalism platform, De Correspondent. All names in this article are fictitious, except for Wouter Slotboom\u2019s. We handled the intercepted data with the utmost care and erased it immediately after our last meeting.

Following is this week\u2019s newsletter\u200a\u2014\u200asign up here to get future issues. \u201cSuccess consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aWinston Churchill This is the 87th edition of the For The Interested newsletter. I mentioned that to somebody today and it blew their mind, but I barely think about how many I\u2019ve written. Because the way to do something for 87 of 88 weeks in a row (I skipped my wedding week) is to not think about what it takes to do something for that long. I focus on each week\u2019s newsletter. Every week. And when you do that, the rest takes care of itself. Now, on to this week\u2019s ideas\u2026 \u201cRather than post content about a specific topic that at best appeals to 50% of your audience, post content that enables 100% of your audience to project their own personal favorites on to it.\u201d Most people think the secret to successful social media content is to focus your posts around popular topics related to your niche. But I\u2019ve found a different strategy often performs better. In this post I explain how to create a social media post 100% of your followers will like and break down how I learned to create posts that are flexible enough to appeal to your entire audience. \u201cAlways order one extra dish at a restaurant, an unfamiliar one. You might like it, which would be splendid. If you don\u2019t like it, all you lost was a couple of bucks.\u201d There\u2019s no shortage of people sharing life lessons online these days, but this one\u2019s got some suggestions that go beyond the typical stuff. Bloomberg columnist Megan McArdle\u2019s 12 Rules For Life include to go to the party even when you don\u2019t want to, give people living eulogies instead of just compliments, and give yourself permission to be bad at something because mastery is boredom. \u201cThe most successful people consistently get their most important work done first.\u201d Most people either under-schedule or over-schedule their day and their work suffers as a result. Fast Company spoke with several experts to compile a collection of advice on how to create a schedule that works for you. The tips include to create time bookends to your day, start the day with a full schedule, and set your availability to the minimum amount of time you can (hint: the default time for your meetings doesn\u2019t have to be 60 minutes). \u201cYou going to bed with a clear conscience is not going to stop college kids from getting assaulted. You thinking climate change is terrible is not going to stop climate change.\u201d This two-minute Guardian video is about a lot more than just racism. Marlon James offers a powerful take on the difference between being non-racist and anti-racist and urges people to take action on the issues they care about as opposed to thinking it\u2019s enough to just be against things. \u201cWhen you make a mistake you have two choices. One is you can accept that the final product is gonna be flawed, and maybe no one will ever see it but you will always see there\u2019s a little hole right there. The other alternative is to start over. And either of those options is totally fine.\u201d Eve L. Ewing is a poet, author, and sociologist who also happens to have some smart things to say about how to challenge your own ideas of failure as a writer or creative person. In this Creative Independent interview, she explains that sometimes creators are too quick to assume they\u2019re bad at something when the truth may be they\u2019re just not ready to do it yet. \u201cIf you find something that makes you really FEEL something\u200a\u2014\u200aguilty, afraid, or even excited\u200a\u2014\u200adon\u2019t let it sit buried in some skimmable paragraph. Take a step back and ask yourself, \u2018How can I go deeper here?\u2019\u201d If you sell something, you\u2019re going to want to read this Growth Lab article. It\u2019s a case study of exactly how a $100,000 sales page is made featuring a step-by-step breakdown of the recent creation of a sales page for an online course called \u201cTeach Yourself Anything.\u201d The process includes to talk to your potential customers before you write a single word, come up with more ideas than you need, and use the \u201cGuilt Trip Test\u201d to craft emotional copy. \u201cEach month I selected a new theme: something I would add or subtract to my life for the entire month. I invested each full month to explore and analyze the theme, and my relationship to it.\u201d I\u2019m a fan of trying different experiments to improve my life (see my Great List experiment I wrote about last week). I haven\u2019t tried Alex Abelin More & Less Challenge, but it seems like a simple way to make some positive changes in your life. In 2017, he decided to do more or less of one thing each month and tracked the impact those shifts had on his life. He details the results in this post, including what he learned from spending months doing more good deeds, more sweating, and more journaling, as well as months where he did less spending, social media, and alcohol. \u201cTo think of a business as a series of hacks and transactional relationships, you\u2019ll never amass the expertise that your future self and future businesses need to succeed.\u201d Our collective obsession with productivity hacks and passive income is leading many entrepreneurs, businesses and artists to miss a key point\u200a\u2014\u200acraftsmanship is more important. Daniel Tawfik makes the point that craftsmanship is the alternative to the four-hour work week mindset and suggests you optimize for the long term and focus on mastery of your craft. \u201cWe\u2019re used to a world where if you put something out there that\u2019s good, people see it and share it. But that\u2019s just not true in this world. Someone can make something really good, and just because of some weird algorithmic reasons, or if it\u2019s not designed specifically for Facebook, it doesn\u2019t do well. And then it becomes impossible to know what a good thing to make is anymore.\u201d While I don\u2019t 100% agree with everything that\u2019s in this one (it\u2019s not just Facebook\u2019s fault\u200a\u2014\u200athere are also issues with publishers/creators, advertising-based business models, and audiences), there\u2019s a lot of truth to it. Matt Klinman, a former Funny or Die employee, tells Splitsider why he believes Facebook is killing comedy and echoes concerns of other publishers about how Facebook\u2019s algorithm has essentially wiped out the opportunities the Internet once offered creators. It\u2019s an excellent read about how all creative industries (not just comedy) are being impacted by Facebook. \u201c\u2018There\u2019s nowhere else to learn about sex,\u2019 the suburban boy told me. \u2018And porn stars know what they are doing.\u2019 His words reflect a paradox about sex and pornography in this country. Even as smartphones have made it easier for teenagers to watch porn, sex education in the United States\u200a\u2014\u200awhere abstinence-based sex education remains the norm\u200a\u2014\u200ais meager.\u201d This one might blow your mind (no pun intended). The New York Times magazine spoke to adolescents, educators, and sex researchers for a break down of how online porn is impacting teenagers and they found it\u2019s essentially become the country\u2019s default sex education. Yikes. I discovered some of this week\u2019s ideas from the newsletters of Kyle Westaway, Dave Pell, and Ann Friedman\u200a\u2014\u200athey\u2019re all awesome and worth your time.

I was always a first in, last out kind of worker. As a natural early riser, it didn\u2019t take a lot of effort to get to the office early. I was often surprised to be the only one there but appreciated the quiet time to get my day started. As my colleagues filed out promptly at 5:00 p.m., I somehow always had something to finish up or wanted to prepare for the next day. It didn\u2019t seem like a big deal to me to stay a little late. I wondered why were they were all so quick to rush off. Lunch breaks were often very brief and spent at my desk. Sure I occasionally went out with colleagues or met up with a friend but that seemed to be the exception. No one told me I had to work 60+ hours each week. I just did it. It felt like the responsible thing to do. There was work to do. I wanted to do a good job. I wanted to be good at what I did. I wanted to be recognized as a hard worker. I didn\u2019t expect the burnout. I didn\u2019t expect the resentment. I didn\u2019t expect that no one really cared how many hours I worked each week. Not my boss. Not my friends. Not my family. It wasn\u2019t how they measured my success or worth. Being a workaholic wasn\u2019t healthy. The were few rewards but there were plenty of lessons. The most disheartening was that no one really cared how many hours I worked. That\u2019s when I realized that I had to re-calibrate my life. I\u2019m not proud of the hours I spent overworking but I am happy to be a recovering workaholic. Are you ready for something different? Let\u2019s connect.

I think most of you have been aware of \u201cthe odd notch\u201d of the iPhone X UI design. But what really bothers to the developer is that Apple made the announcements regarding the UI adaptation, it stressed that the developer can not hide the rounded corners of the device screen and also does not allow to design a black top status bar to hide the device sensor housing. So this policy has brought big trouble to the developers. Luckily, the team of Safari web browser engine\u200a\u2014\u200aWebKit will explain to us the details about how to optimize the UI design for iPhone X. WebKit team takes the Safari as an example. In a nutshell, the page contents have been moved to the middle of the device screen to avoid the device sensor housing area, but the rounded corners can\u2019t be blank and the page\u2019s content can\u2019t be obscured by the device sensor housing area, like the pictures shown below. Using the viewport to adopt the safe area, and then you can use the iPhone X for web design in the safe area. Here, the page\u2019s content will not be obscured by the device sensor housing or rounded corners. It\u2019s required to fill in the matching color on both sides of the blank area after finishing the design in the safe area, will just be like the pictures shown below: The final effect looks great after all, but this is the design instances of webpage. There are more APPs need to redesign, but we believe that many apps will be adapted after the iPhone X is officially on sale in November.

Culture is, in many ways, an accumulation of accidents, small gestures and stumbles that somehow end up sticking together like a giant snowball rolling down a hill. Every successful band has the moment when they almost gave up just before their breakthrough; every artistic movement has its rejections, arguments, and fistfights; every book has a graveyard of characters and scenes that were killed to make way for the story. The end result may look neat\u200a\u2014\u200alibraries of books ordered alphabetically, artworks organized into linear chronologies\u200a\u2014\u200abut the process of making culture is anything but. The same is true for how we measure the attention we give to culture. As we\u2019ve seen in earlier episodes of this series on the history of attention, the concepts we use to frame and organize attention are palimpsests, built through the same competitions, frustrations, and dead ends as culture itself. They are invented to solve an immediate problem but grow in value and importance until they end up an inextricable part of the culture they seek to measure. This is how the singles chart started\u200a\u2014\u200anot as an attempt to create the most influential concept in music of the past half-century, but as an attempt to sell more advertising in a fledgling music magazine. Its inventor, Percy Dickins, was a magazine advertising salesman, ex-merchant seaman, and keen amateur musician. Stuck at the Melody Maker, the stuffy trade magazine for professional musicians, Dickins jumped at the chance to join the team starting a new magazine\u200a\u2014\u200athe New Musical Express. Looking to find ways to increase its advertising income, he saw an opportunity to run lists of the bestselling singles, a relatively new format that was gaining popularity with young music fans: The first chart ran in the NME on November 14, 1952. At number one was the crooner Al Martino, with \u201cHere in My Heart.\u201d Vera Lynn, the \u201cForces\u2019 Sweetheart\u201d whose songs had helped Britain through World War II, had three out of the 12 songs on this first list. Like Britain itself in the 1950s, the first singles chart felt like an in-between moment. The explosions of World War II were just beginning to recede, and the explosions of rock and roll were yet to be heard. It was a calm, sweet, and soothing list, ideal for a postwar Britain, made up of Bing Crosby, Frankie Laine, and Rosemary Clooney. Almost exactly a decade later, in May 1963, the Beatles had their first number one, \u201cFrom Me to You,\u201d and the role of the singles chart in popular youth culture was firmly established. The charts were the focus of a new, rawly emotional explosion of youth culture, driven by the passionate behaviors of fans. It was a hotly contested battleground, obsessed over by fans and artists, the target of shady attempts at manipulation by record companies and promoters. Within just 10 years, the singles chart had grown from a simple list in a new magazine to the engine that drove a cultural revolution. But the singles chart wasn\u2019t invented to do this. Percy Dickins wasn\u2019t trying to start a revolution; he just wanted to sell more advertising space. There are millions of books about popular music\u200a\u2014\u200abiographies of rock legends, cultural criticism, academic studies, and cash-ins on the latest trends. But surprisingly, there are no books about the chart as a cultural concept itself. There are encyclopedias listing chart positions for every artist through chart history, but there are no books analyzing the chart as an idea, as something that made culture as well as just measuring it. The music chart is, at its most simple, just a list. In the UK, this list was made up by asking a small sample of shops to report on record sales. In the United States, the Billboard Hot 100 was created in 1955 by merging three previous lists measuring singles sales, radio airplay, and jukebox plays (jukebox plays were dropped within the first two years). There are similar lists in other areas of culture, like movies and books, but they haven\u2019t ended up defining their industries in the same way as the music charts. Within a decade of its invention, the music industry would be focused around achieving chart success, with entire teams spending millions of dollars to try to make sure their artists reach that coveted number one spot. What was it that made the chart, this simple list, so economically and culturally significant? Two things might explain its success. The first has to do with time\u200a\u2014\u200athe charts were updated on a relatively speedy weekly basis. This was not a deliberate strategy, but since weekly music magazines invented the charts in the United States and UK, the singles chart had to be updated every week. Having such a fast turnover meant that the charts reflected, and to a certain extent drove, the quickening pace of youth culture in the late 20th century. Every week, the chart created new stories\u200a\u2014\u200aacts that were making their debut, roaring up the charts, being replaced by hotter new acts, or reaching the glorious summit of number one. The charts were an ongoing soap opera for pop fans, a mythic world in which their gods fought each other for supremacy. But this weekly rhythm did something else, something more profound. It fixed music to a specific time. Particularly during the emotional maelstrom of our adolescence, music helped us fix memories in the growing stories of our lives. For the period when the charts were the way we discovered music, songs were inextricably linked to the weeks they spent in the charts. They became a shorthand for collective memory\u200a\u2014\u200aa cultural soundtrack of the late 20th century. After decades of the charts, this has made popular music a potent tool for provoking memory and nostalgia. Because our experience of music was so closely linked to a specific time, it can be used to evoke a deeply emotional, immersive recollection of what we were doing, feeling, and thinking at that moment. This has been regularly exploited by the TV and film industries, from Happy Days to Stranger Things. There seems to be a particularly potent link between archive news footage and chart music\u200a\u2014\u200athe BBC ran a hugely successful series in the 1980s called The Rock and Roll Years that consisted of just archive footage and current chart music, with no narrator or voiceover. The documentary filmmaker Adam Curtis has used this technique to create what he calls \u201cemotional stories\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200afilms that use popular music and archives to give an immersive impression of what it was like to live through a specific moment, rather than tell the story from an objective perspective: The second factor in the single chart\u2019s success was that it was equally important to both fans and industry\u200a\u2014\u200athe charts were public and popular. Percy Dickens went to work at the NME because he wanted to move away from the more staid, music industry\u2013oriented Melody Maker. As pop culture grew in the 1960s and 1970s, these weekly music magazines were voraciously consumed by the public and the industry alike. This made the charts the primary means of discovering new music, as well as a measure of success. Other media industries, like books and films, have had similar weekly charts, but they\u2019re not as influential as the pop charts are to music fans. Film distributors might be obsessed with box-office rankings, but film fans are as interested in reviews, ratings, and awards as they are charts. Book charts are important for classifying a book as a \u201cbestseller,\u201d but consumer buying is driven more by advertising, word of mouth, book clubs, placement/discounting in stores, and algorithmic recommendation on Amazon than by the weekly bestseller chart. More than any of these lists, the music chart was the beating heart of the culture that it measured. In the late 20th century, music became one of the primary means for teenagers to explore and experiment with identity. It was a tribal signal of belonging, of rebellion, a statement of who we thought we were to the outside world. The music chart was therefore not just an inert compilation of data, but the aggregation of millions of moments of identification and self-realization. It was emotion, passion, and identity, all wrapped up in a weekly list of 40 or so records. These two factors\u200a\u2014\u200aa regular rhythm of weekly publishing and passionate adoption by pop music fans\u200a\u2014\u200awere the reason the music chart was so central to the music industry. They were both the result of Percy Dicken\u2019s decisions back in 1952, when he was just trying to sell more advertising. By putting the singles chart at the heart of the New Musical Express, he accidentally helped make a simple list of data into something public, powerful, and passionate. Our obsession with the singles chart often dies away as we grow out of our youth. By the time we get to middle age, most of us lose track of the soap opera that is the charts. Music might still be an essential part of our cultural life, but it\u2019s less of a tribal part of our identity. The chart itself has had a midlife crisis, driven not by a dimming of teenage passions, but by a change in the way we buy music. In its prime, the chart was inextricably linked to radio and physical single sales. By the early 2000s, the rise of digital downloads had a major effect on the way we bought music and, as a result, to the charts. Data journalist Cath Sleeman has analyzed the amount of time songs spend in the UK Top 40 and found a remarkable shift as soon as downloaded tracks were included in the chart data. Before then, in the 1980s and 1990s, most singles spent about four weeks on the charts. By the end of 2014, this had doubled to eight weeks. This shift illustrates how the chart\u2019s importance has changed as our music listening moved from physical to digital sales. Record shops had limited space for inventory, so they focused on chart records. With the near-infinite inventory of digital stores, music fans bought songs over longer periods, leading to them staying on the chart longer. The chart has changed again with the rise of streaming music services like Spotify. In 2014, when those services were officially included in chart data, they accounted for around 40 percent of \u201csales\u201d (with 100 streamed plays equal to one \u201csale\u201d). By 2018, this had risen to 80 percent, even though the number of streams to equal one sale was increased to 150. Streaming albums also means that every track can be counted as a \u201csingle,\u201d leading to major albums dominating the charts in the week of their release. In March 2017, 16 out of the top 20 UK singles were tracks from Ed Sheeran\u2019s new album \u201cDivide,\u201d giving the chart a crisis of identity\u200a\u2014\u200ahad the way we consumed music changed so much that the chart was no longer an effective way of representing the industry? The chart, in its heyday, was both a metric for sales and the means to discover new music. It was both exhaust and fuel\u200a\u2014\u200aan engine that drove a revolution in pop music. Perhaps its demise has been caused by the separation of these two roles. The chart continues to adapt in order to track the changing way we listen to music, but the role of discovery has shifted from the chart itself to the Spotify playlist. In the late 20th century, the most influential figures in the music industry were the pluggers and promoters, the shadowy figures who knew which record stores were tracked for chart data or how to get radio stations to put a single on rotation. Payola\u200a\u2014\u200athe practice of paying promoters to get songs on radio playlists\u200a\u2014\u200awas widespread throughout the industry. In the 1980s, Dick Asher, president of CBS, tried an experiment by not paying promoters in Los Angeles to support the Pink Floyd single \u201cAnother Brick in the Wall.\u201d After a few weeks\u2019 standoff, with the song charting everywhere expect L.A., Asher relented and paid up. With the promoters now getting their cut, the song quickly leaped to number one. Record companies are now learning how to game Spotify playlists as they once did the charts. The biggest Spotify playlists have millions of followers, so getting a song on these playlists is almost a guarantee of success. Just as records used to be released in multiple versions to boost chart positions, songs are now being released in multiple versions to get on the most influential Spotify playlists: If the chart is dying, or is at least seeming less relevant, then there is a remarkable circularity in its journey. It started in 1952 with one artist\u200a\u2014\u200aVera Lynn\u200a\u2014\u200ahaving a quarter of the entries on the chart. Over the next 50 years, it became the focus of a huge explosion of pop culture and the engine driving a global billion-dollar industry. Now, as the role of the \u201cHot List\u201d passes from the charts to Spotify playlists, that moment is marked by another artist\u200a\u2014\u200aEd Sheeran\u200a\u2014\u200adominating the charts. From Vera Lynn to Ed Sheeran, the past 50 years of the music industry wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the singles chart. It was more than just a list; it was the beating heart of music culture in an era when the limitations of physical distribution meant that the chart could create a shared experience out of the passionate, tribal world of pop music. As the way we listen to music changes, from charts to playlists, we might be losing not just the chart, but this shared experience as well.

It\u2019s a city that I\u2019ll never forget. I was miserable, I was depressed. I couldn\u2019t speak a word of Chinese or understand its culture. The only reason why I stayed was because I wanted to support my ex. We had been together for 7 years since high school, and I knew China was going to be a stressful life, but how it ended up was nothing I could\u2019ve imagined. I did everything I could at the time to support my ex, anything to make his life easier and happier. I would cook him 2\u20133 meals a day.I would massage his back if he felt stressed.Anything he asked of me, I did it without question\u200a\u2014\u200ato the best of my abilities. But somewhere down the road, he began to change. He started becoming more impatient and demanding. He began telling me what I should change. He said I was no longer allowed to hang out with any of my guy friends. He told me I didn\u2019t look good enough, that I had to put on makeup and to find better-looking clothes. And more often than not, he\u2019d call me stupid. Which hurt, a lot. Despite all of that, I hid how I felt and took everything in because I knew work must\u2019ve been stressful for him, so I did what he asked. I wanted to prove to him that I could be better, that I could be someone he would be proud of. I did everything I could to change, yet he still wasn\u2019t satisfied. And then it happened. He suggested a 1 year dating plan where we\u2019d see other people anywhere for a few months up to a year. I remember him saying, I didn\u2019t agree at first, but he was relentless. He kept insisting that we try this dating plan over and over again, to the point where I felt like that was the only choice I had, because if I didn\u2019t agree\u2026 he would leave me. My heart sank. I was confused and hurt. Why would you have to date other people when you know who you really love? I didn\u2019t understand why this had to happen; it didn\u2019t even make sense to me. And even though I didn\u2019t want to go with his request, I told him I\u2019d give it a try. I just didn\u2019t want to lose him; the one who I\u2019d been with for a third of my life. But as soon as I agreed, he completely changed. He started drinking more. He started going out late at nights, ignoring my messages. He wouldn\u2019t be home most of the week and every message asking him if he\u2019d be home for dinner went unanswered. I was home, alone, in a country whose language I didn\u2019t speak a word of, in a relationship I wasn\u2019t sure would last. It was the saddest moment of my life, and I just felt like my entire world was falling apart. The moment when I thought things couldn\u2019t get any worse, he took it one step further. He started showing me pictures of the girls he had been flirting with, asking me if I thought they were pretty. I was shocked. It was rude and disrespectful; he had disregarded the full 7 years of our relationship and it hurt me to my core knowing that this is the person I had once loved. Was this still the same person I knew? Why did this happen? This continued on for weeks until one day, he told me that he had booked a ticket for me to return back to the states\u2026 all because I was an inconvenience to the girls he wanted to bring home. My heart broke into a million pieces. My mind fogged up. I couldn\u2019t breathe. I had a feeling this was eventually going to happen but it hurt me more than I\u2019d thought. At that point, I didn\u2019t know what to do with my life. I had nobody to talk to. Family and friends didn\u2019t understand; they only pitied me and said I\u2019d eventually find someone else. But that wasn\u2019t what I needed. What I needed was to find myself, to discover who I could be and what I was capable of. I had lived life giving my everything to someone who didn\u2019t appreciate me and in the end casted me away. I never gave myself the chance to discover what it was that I wanted and what my passions were. I started writing because I needed a way to channel out my thoughts and feelings, to vent my frustrations. It was the hardest thing to do coming out from a failed relationship, and scary because I wasn\u2019t good at writing. But I did it anyways. I told myself I had to at least try and that as long as I set my mind on it, I could do anything. So day after day, I wrote\u200a\u2014\u200aeven when I was sick, even when I was tired, even when I was crying and wasn\u2019t in the mood. I kept writing anyways. Eventually, I started gaining traction on Medium. I started getting some side money. Publishers even began asking me to write for them, an honor I\u2019ll never forget and remain thankful for. Writing has helped me realize that I\u2019m a lot more capable than I had initially thought. It has helped me voice my thoughts, express my feelings and allowed me to discover a part of myself that I never knew existed. And while it has changed my entire life, it wasn\u2019t enough. I decided to travel because it was something I had always wanted to do but never had a chance to do so. So I packed my bags, booked a one-way ticket to Southeast Asia and never looked back since. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s next or what I\u2019m going to do, but I\u2019m going to keep rebuilding my life. I\u2019m going to discover who I am and figure out what it is that I want to do, while writing in Southeast Asia. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

Prior to that, I could not sustain my motivation and discipline long enough to get anywhere, sometimes not even for a day. When I was 21, before I discovered how to create and sustain this staying power, I quit college after a series of miserable false-start semesters. I just could not handle the work and stress of a job and school. I\u2019d be sure I was ready do what was necessary to succeed, but then, things would fall apart. However, at age 38, with a new firm grasp on staying power, I started again, got the degree, then a graduate degree, and then a Department of Health license to practice Mental Health Counseling. At one time, when I was younger, I could not muster the stick-to-it-ness to follow through on so many dreams that one has, hundreds, the energy fading when the difficulty became apparent. Today, among other things, I\u2019ve built a successful private practice that has grown in good will over the years, created a nationwide organization of therapists who teach my successful weight loss methods, and I\u2019ve written and published a book that has helped people around the world solve their weight problem. It took a lot of starts and stops and lots of study to understand why my motivation and discipline would come and go, most of the time not staying long enough to create anything good. But eventually, I got it. You can too. There is a phenomenon that we all need to know about so that we can overcome it. I call it \u201cThe Vanishing Power\u201d. You have probably experienced it many times. An example is when you may hear a great sermon or powerful speech and are filled with hope and enthusiasm. You walk away ready to conquer the world, confident in your coming success, filled with energy, ideas and dreams of success. And you gain traction and start getting somewhere! But, by the end of the week, the power fades, evaporates, and you wonder what happened. When you go again to hear the preacher, the great teacher or great coach, you hear the message again, and are recharged. You set out again with that regained power and start getting somewhere again. You wonder, \u201cHow did that happen? Why did it poop out before?\u201d Was the power real? Was the short-term success you experienced real? Yes, of course. You felt it. You lived it. But then the power vanished. The power faded because the power of the teacher, the empowering words, evaporated, vanished, and got replaced. They were in the brain for a while, and while they were, they created a reality of their making. But when they were forgotten, literally erased and replaced, they no longer exerted their power.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We tend to think that learning is a matter of reading or hearing something, and then we know it, it is ours. But that\u2019s not how our brains work. Rarely do we hear something once and retain it and make use of it, especially if we skipped it, discounted it, disagreed with it, or weren\u2019t paying attention. In those cases, it doesn\u2019t even get recorded.\u00a0\u00a0Even if we think it is wonderful, get enthused and find we are empowered to do what we had been unable to do, the power often fades over time, and we wonder what happened. I\u2019ve seen this happen with more than a few of my clients. When I check, it\u2019s like they have forgotten what was taught. The knowledge, the words, have been erased! Evaporated! Replaced!\u00a0\u00a0I am reminded of the parable of the sower, wisdom from a source beyond our understanding.\u00a0\u00a0What I teach has power when it is believed and retained, when it has taken root in the mind so that it works even when we are not. That certainly does not occur when it is not heard. But even when it is heard and understood, where a person has the surprising empowerment, the \u201cah-ha\u201d revelations, the power often fades over time as the knowledge evaporates, the ideas becoming forgotten and unused.\u00a0I experienced this phenomenon of the vanishing power many times, always stupefied and frustrated by it until I learned about it and learned how to overcome it, how to create and sustain that power.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps some can hear an important lesson once, and then make it part of themselves, never to be forgotten, impacting their life on an unconscious basis from that day forward. It often happens with trauma, like touching a hot stove.\u00a0However, I had to overcome the phenomenon of vanishing power by doing the work to make sure those empowering words took root, hearing them over and over so that my recorder got it, like rote, taking root and becoming a permanent part of me. I also needed to root myself in something greater than myself, their source, with belief that this power to create was a part of me and that I was irreversibly connected to it, as a wellspring is connected to the earth. We need to keep working, keep thinking the thoughts that keep us whole and well and make us able to create and succeed. We need to keep connecting with those words and their source. I had to keep reading them and hearing them and thinking them every day until they eventually became mine, became me. I imagine you will need to also. Every one of my clients has experienced this phenomenon of vanishing power. Every successful person has. It doesn\u2019t stop us or keep us from the success we deserve unless we don\u2019t do what needs to be done to overcome it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Keep working, keep learning. Keep growing.

From conversational interfaces, biometrics, design sprints, to augmented reality and iBeacons\u2026 It\u2019s meant to be an exciting 2018! 2018 is set to be the year of voice interface devices. The Echo Dot was Amazon\u2019s best selling item over the holiday season, selling millions of units. Google also reports that they sell more than one Google Home device every second, with the total already in the tens of millions. Similarly to smartphones at that time, the third-party app scene for digital assistants is very much in its infancy. Browsing the list of available apps for Google Assistant results in some very amateurish attempts. Clearly, the platform is ripe for companies to make their mark. In the past, people\u2019s first port of call when looking to interact with a business was telephone. Then it became through their desktop PC and now it\u2019s through their mobile phone. It won\u2019t be long before people expect a service to be available on their digital assistant. This could go from purchasing a product, interacting with customer care or accessing content. Currently, the functionality of these devices is very much focused on home automation. There is no doubt that as their capabilities grow so will users\u2019 expectations. This year I am excited about Design Sprints. Last year we spent some time training with Jake Knapp. He\u2019s the New York Times best-selling author of \u201cSprint\u201d. He is also the inventor of the Design Sprint process. At the end of the process you have a realistic prototype, tested with real customers. This lets you learn if your idea is desirable. If it is, you can move forward with confidence. If it doesn\u2019t resonate with your customers you know what needs to change. This removes a lot of risk from your project. We have been testing the process with some of our clients and on some of our internal projects. The results have been great so we are now offering a dedicated Design Sprint Package. It includes everything you need to go from big idea to customer tested prototype. It works for companies or organisations of any size. There have been huge advancements in the field of Machine Learning in the past 5 years\u200a\u2014\u200aand more than a little hype! We\u2019re hoping that 2018 will be the year we begin to see commercially available fully-autonomous vehicles on our roads. Other industries are also due to be significantly disrupted, such as medical imaging. Advances in Machine Learning could significantly cut waiting times to analyse test results. In 2018 we\u2019re likely to see an upswing in AI in consumer devices as dedicated AI processors integrate into devices. GPUs have been great for the advancement of Machine Learning. Dedicated chips will see faster, more efficient training and execution of Machine Learning models, in the cloud and on our devices. AR is rapidly growing in popularity. You might have used it and\u00a0not have even been aware. It goes from social media filters or visualising how that sofa will look into your living room to surgical procedures. ARKit is Apple\u2019s big bet on bringing AR to mainstream consumers by introducing it directly into iOS. It already has millions of people using the technology in closer ways to what we experienced with Pok\u00e9mon Go. This release will help blend the virtual and the real more seamlessly than ever before. Android recently announced their long-awaited contribution to Augmented Reality with ARCore. This has also heralded the death of the heavily device-confined project Tango. ARcore has now become their primary focus in the AR field. The current preview is not without its own limitations as only Google Pixel and Galaxy S8 devices are currently supported. Although Google have promised they will add hundreds of millions more devices to the support matrix later in the year. The quickstart guides provide a great starting point. You can download your own 3D assets to replace the 3D Andy icon that is provided by default. Or better yet, model your own with a 3D software package such as Blender or Google\u2019s newly announced Blocks. For non-Android devs, the SDK is also available on Unity, Unreal, C (via Android NDK) and Web. Whether a project of value in the real world emerges from the formative framework in the coming year is yet to be seen. Creating your own 3D model and projecting into the real world is enough fun to justify time spent experimenting with the samples. We will continue to see a shift towards conversational interfaces and chatbots this year. Chatbots will be a key factor for brands to enhance their customer experience and become more approachable. Chatbots provide instant gratification offering answers to your customers, right where they are. While improving your customer service, they are helping brands saving on operational costs. Messaging apps have now surpassed social networks for monthly active users. We can see brands are interacting with their customers in this space more and more. They are increasingly using chatbots to instantly solve customers\u2019 issues and answer queries. while gaining a deeper understanding of their needs. Not only that but they are also helping customers to perform tasks on their own. Purchasing flights, getting a mobile phone upgrade or booking a doctor\u2019s appointment has never been easier! Chatbot popularity is also growing in an e-commerce context, becoming more of a personal shopping assistant. They can learn from customers\u2019 style and tastes and provide ideas to pick up a new outfit or holiday gifts. They are already driving and facilitating purchases. We got started designing chatbots at Marino and can\u2019t wait to see what exciting projects 2018 will bring! iBeacons have continued to rise in prominence in the past year. Even though their adoption has been slow, the iBeacon market is being projected to continue its astounding rise. It\u2019s estimated to reach greater than 91% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2017 to 2025. Their versatility means that we can use them for countless different industries and use cases. So far we\u2019ve seen iBeacons put to use in shopping centres, offices, factories, museums, schools, hospitals and many other places. A well thought-out pairing of iBeacons and software can have far reaching benefits for companies in 2018 and the years to come. We\u2019ve already got started researching and experimenting with iBeacons in 2017 when designing a wayfinding app. If you have an idea about how you\u2019d like to apply them in some way then we\u2019d love to hear from you. Security is in a bad place as we enter 2018. We have seen some of the worst security exploits ever come to light with Meltdown and Spectre in the last few months of 2017. These exploits are so harmful that users can only hope that industry-wide, operating system vendors will resolve the problem as quickly as possible. It\u2019s inevitable though that millions of users will be left behind. We can see signs of this shift happening. For instance, Google recently announced that it will set a minimum allowed API level for new Android apps starting August 2018. Forcing use of a recent OS also ensures the users are getting the latest security updates. Likewise, as an industry, we\u2019ve spent 20 years teaching people to come up with the weakest password they can to get around the password requirements. Everyone is using the exact same substitutions. Recently on a client\u2019s site, while searching for a lost account password, I tried a few guesses\u2026 answer was P@ssw0rd123. The natural answer to this is Biometrics. In 2018 we should reach the point where every mobile phone sold will have some form of Biometric sensor such as a fingerprint, face or iris scanner. Biometric sensors also provide greatly enhanced security over common SMS based two-factor systems. Now that the sensors are wide spread there are fewer reasons not to use them. Personal assistants have come a long way, with a significant increase in quality and interest seen in 2017. Google Assistant is the widest reaching personal assistant on the mobile market today. It\u2019s supported on over 55% of Android phones, and over 98% of iPhones. Asking questions about products or services via the Google Assistant is the closest to being physically in the store. It even allows customers to complete their orders digitally. From clothes shopping to bedtime stories, we will be able to build for one of the widest-reaching voice assistants on the market this year. We will be able to build conversational-driven applications using Actions. These will greatly extend Google\u2019s existing Assistant. As more people start using the Assistant, demand for voice and chat-based solutions will rise. It will be a great opportunity for businesses to be present on mobile and other devices such as Google Home or Alexa. Assistant SDK is set be released later this year. It will allow developers to fully integrate the existing Assistant into other projects and products. Over 400 million devices will be able to access the assistant, including the new range of TVs and headphones announced by Google at CES 2018. Its true potential for fully voice-controlled mobile and home devices is yet to be seen. 2018 will be a huge year for Privacy. In May the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will kick in. While this is an EU initiative it applies to any company handling the data of EU citizens and even the data of non-EU citizens while they are in Europe. The big concern for the EU has been that citizens data would leak to the US via companies such as Google and Facebook, but they will now have to comply with the GDPR if they want to continue to do business in the EU. This will also put it up to other jurisdictions to protect their citizens data to a similar extent. Another interesting set of developments for privacy are the changes in attitude to social media privacy. The multiple problems here such as fake news in feeds, harvesting of user data for no clear reason and cyberbullying have been trumped by the ongoing investigations into nation state interference in social platforms Mark Zuckerberg seems to have woken up to the problem and early this year has has said his 2018 goal is fixing Facebook. He has specifically mentioned problems with \u201cabuse and hate, defending against interference by nation states, or making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent.\u201d If resolved this can only lead to improvements for users and how their data is handled. It\u2019s easier said than done though, any change to the feed algorithm has knock-on effects on advertisers and Facebook\u2019s stock fell 4% on the announcement. One of the technologies we research at Marino is \u201cthe blockchain\u201d. This year we can expect to see interest in blockchain projects further increase, buoyed by financial speculation in Bitcoin. Simply put, blockchain is a way to share access to information with people you don\u2019t completely trust. The first blockchain implementation was Bitcoin, a secure digital currency.

Work run by algorithms, platforms that make people something like neo-servants\u200a\u2014\u200achauffeurs, cooks, butlers\u200a\u2014\u200aperforming instant-gratification on-demand two-hour deliveries, jobs that devolve to \u201cgigs\u201d, the spiralling anxiety, rage, and despair, that it all creates. A world where the future of work, life, and play, is a program controlled by Amazon, Uber, WeWork, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and their offspring. What does that world look like? Is it one we should want? Have we thought about it much at all? Let me begin with what technofeudalism means for work and play. In technofeudalism, the algorithm is the boss. Workers at Amazon warehouses are managed, checked, and monitored by algorithms, who demand ever greater speed and accuracy and diligence. Now, you might say, \u201cSo?! What\u2019s the difference?\u201d Ah, make no mistake. Work managed by algorithms, not managers, is a tidal shift in human history. See how you chase likes and favorites in your free time, addicted to dopamine hits? The algorithm is your boss\u200a\u2014\u200aeven when you think are at leisure, you are really at work, something like a servant, earning profits that reward you nothing. And we are not considering any of this nearly carefully enough. Algorithms aren\u2019t human beings. They don\u2019t mistakes. They don\u2019t care. You can\u2019t give them feedback or insight or even a \u201cno\u201d. They are the definition of cruel. They leave no room for our emotions, do they? You don\u2019t feel \u201chappy\u201d on Facebook\u200a\u2014\u200ayou feel relieved, maybe. The worker at the Amazon warehouse feels exactly the same way, too. So it isn\u2019t just that algorithmic work and play turn whatever they touch into menial labour, even \u201chaving fun\u201d or \u201cmaking friends\u201d\u2014formulaic, routine, no room for imagination or innovation\u200a\u2014\u200ait is that algorithimic life is hyper-alienating. It sets a vanishingly low but iron-clad bar on what we can really give to one another\u2014 happiness, empathy, beauty, truth, wisdom, courage, grace\u200a\u2014\u200athat we can never really reach past. In that way, algorithmic work and play does not humanize and nurture us\u200a\u2014\u200ait dehumanizes and deprives us. Of the best in one another. We need all those things to have life-changing breakthroughs, remain sane, and go on being citizens of democracy. So an economy whose effort and leisure is \u201cmanaged\u201d by algorithms is likely to trade efficiency and productivity for humanity and creativity\u200a\u2014\u200aand likely to lose trust in democracy, too. Does that sound like a good trade to you? Perhaps you will still minimize this, so ask yourself: would you like to be managed by an algorithm? How would it make you feel? Would you ever be able to please it? Wouldn\u2019t you feel constantly enraged as a result? Don\u2019t you already if you spend too long on social media? If you had to work that way too, wouldn\u2019t you feel like giving up on life, society, and the point of it all? Be honest. There\u2019s no one else listening. Now. Algorithmic work destroys the idea of a \u201cjob\u201d. It just needs people to perform immediate tasks\u200a\u2014\u200aand they are interchangeable. Whether they are warehouse workers or therapists or doctors. Some professions might have to be licensed, but after that, when the manager is an omnisicient algorithm, not a boss, the worker does not have a job\u200a\u2014\u200aonly a set of tasks, sliced and diced for maximal efficiency. The result is what we\u2019ve come to call \u201cgigs\u201d\u2014 but I think that understates the issues. No one is going to have any kind of stability, safety, or security whatsoever\u200a\u2014\u200anot even yesterday\u2019s most highly prized professions. People will simply be at the whim and mercy of what the algorithm demands, today, tomorrow, this hour, this minute\u200a\u2014\u200aand they will be powerless to change it. Enter the techno-serf. The result is that today\u2019s sense of despair, fury, and confusion is only likely to grow. But do you see what that means? One is not even a cog in the machine anymore when the boss is the algorithm\u200a\u2014\u200aa cog can break it down, jam it up, feel something for fellow cogs\u200a\u2014\u200athe techno-serf must be one with the machine. So technofeudalism is also kind of transcendental, quasi-religious capitalism. Let me make that a little clearer. Technofeudalism doesn\u2019t just want our hand and our minds. It wants our souls. That is what it means even for its \u201cwinners\u201d. Do you see how mindfulness and meditation are becoming \u201cwork requirements\u201d at companies most adept in the practice of technofeudalism? Have you ever wondered why that it is? It is a way to manage the tremendous emotional tensions in people who are becoming overlords to serfs. You might think that being a master of serfs would be a pleasant thing, but you would be wrong. Humans are born naturally empathic and caring\u200a\u2014\u200aI know, if you\u2019re American you probably don\u2019t believe that, but that is only because you have been educated badly. Those things must be constantly sucked out of us for us to lose them. To perform the work of overlordship is a much more difficult task, emotionally, than being a manager. One must surrender the last shreds of one\u2019s own empathy, grace, compassion\u200a\u2014\u200afor example, for the alienated warehouse workers being exploited by the algorithm, or the people abused on the network. The \u201cmanagers\u201d in technofeudalism are algorithms, and the people managing them are the overlords. But they must be something like Vulcans\u200a\u2014\u200aperfectly detached, uncaring, human calculators without souls. This is the culmination of emotional labour\u200a\u2014\u200ato become emotionless, because that is the only way one can be a master of an algorithm whose goal is shredding people into their most profitable parts, sucking the most out of them, slicing and dicing their lives apart. Enter mindfulness, or any number of voguish \u201cleadership techniques\u201d, like \u201ccharisma training\u201d. One can calm down and detach one\u2019s self from the consequences of one\u2019s actions. It\u2019s cheaper than a pill, and yields far greater benefits. The point is to pry away a person\u2019s sense of caring, so a manager can become a lord. A tiny example\u200a\u2014\u200abut a telling one nonetheless. What, then, is technofeudalism \u201cmaximizing\u201d? Capitalism, even the neoliberal variety, maximized profits, and suggested, like a religion, they\u2019d rain down on the pious masses (they didn\u2019t). Technofeudalism goes further. It maximizes power differentials. Technofeudalists aren\u2019t interested in profit, per se\u200a\u2014\u200abut in warping power structures. This is the ideological hard end of technology\u200a\u2014\u200aUber, Amazon, and so on. They are companies not so much with financial goals\u200a\u2014\u200abut something more like crusades, missions, with destinies to convert societies. That is why we are beginning to see the resurgence of all kinds of archaic institutional forms. Company towns. Debtors prisons. Strange ideological academies. Tribe and clan. When some people are overlords, and some are techno-serfs, then these forms emerge, just like they did in previous eras. Why not send powerless serfs to prison for not paying off debts? How else to house an army of peasants who cannot afford housing and live in their cars but to build a town for them? The social effect of all this is that class is becoming something more like caste. That is what technofeudalism means for society. If you are a worker at an Amazon warehouse today, what are the chances you will one day be an owner of much of anything? Vanishingly low. Just like in previous eras of human history, where one is born dictates where one stays. Social mobility has fallen, opportunity has gone down the tubes, and dynastism shapes every aspect of our lives now, political, cultural, and economic, as technofeudalism has risen, because technofeudalism maximizes differences in power, not just profit, making some people lords, and others powerless serfs. But not just workers\u200a\u2014\u200aconsumers, too. In technofeudalism, people aren\u2019t consumers and producers anymore\u200a\u2014\u200athey\u2019re more like peasants or serfs. That is what it means for life. People don\u2019t own things\u200a\u2014\u200athey lease services. You can think of the proverbial smart door company that goes out of business and bricks your home. What is the effect on the person once known as a \u201cconsumer\u201d? There are many. He has possessions that have no real value. He is locked into sets of transactions, with no recourse, really to change them. He must constantly pay to \u201cuse\u201d things that he \u201cowns\u201d, which means he cannot really \u201cown\u201d much at all. Let me give you an example to make this point clear. I\u2019ve ordered maybe a dozen things from Amazon over the last few months. Half of them\u200a\u2014\u200aat least\u200a\u2014\u200awere defective, broken, junk. Amazon doesn\u2019t blink an eye. The algorithm knows it\u2019s cheaper to refund me than ship it back. But the effect is that I never know what I\u2019ll get from Amazon exactly\u200a\u2014\u200ajunk, or something that works? So I am bearing all the risks and costs the seller should bear. The cheap price is merely an illusion. But Amazon is a monopoly. So what am I? I am a tributary. I am paying, in a small way, maybe right now even an invisible one, a little bit of tribute upwards. I am performing labour and expending effort to see if what I have got works, whether the parts fit, sending the email that it doesn\u2019t, and so on. I am paying the costs of frustration, exasperation, time, and energy for stuff\u200a\u2014\u200aor reading reviews about how to avoid it. Basically, from an economic point of view, either way, I\u2019m paying tribute to Amazon\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s a landlord, who says, well, this one might work, and if it doesn\u2019t, try another, and another, we\u2019ve got infinity of them\u200a\u2014\u200awe don\u2019t care, it\u2019s your problem, you figure it out, first you pay. Now. Expand that tiny example way, way out. Aren\u2019t Americans basically beginning to pay tribute by any other name in many ways? There is tribute that must be paid to have internet, there to have a bank account, there to have non-functoning healthcare. I don\u2019t just mean \u201cbuying stuff\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aI mean the extra hidden fees and unfair charges on top that are more like taxes. Life under neofeudalism becomes an act of paying tribute. In a modern economy, value descends from top to bottom. The rich invest their fortunes. But a feudal economy works in reverse\u200a\u2014\u200atribute goes from bottom to top\u200a\u2014\u200aand it stays there. Yesterday, that tribute was gold, silver, iron. Today, it is time, energy, freedom, power, cash\u200a\u2014\u200abut it is tribute all the same: a price that must be paid when the lion\u2019s share of resource costs are borne by the serf, precisely because he does not \u201cown\u201d what he \u201cuses\u201d, and so he can ever be \u201ccharged\u201d for it. Yesterday, that was land, water, air. Today, it is information, money, democracy, his very own mind, self, relationships, and emotions\u200a\u2014\u200abut the principle is the same. That is what technofeudalism means for the economy. Tribute flowing upwards, where it gathers, making kings\u200a\u2014\u200ainstead of value downwards, where it makes prosperous, free, and wise middle classes. And for all those reasons, I think, technofeudalism should worry us all. UmairFebruary 2018 By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out. vampire.

Feedback on any written piece is key to honing the craft of writing and becoming a better writer. Yet, one has to be careful on the kind of feedback they seek or receive. One could ask the people closest to them for feedback. However, the chances are that the feedback you get back will be unhelpful in helping you better your piece (and ultimately, your craft). Why?

The nature of books has evolved. Society and technology have changed. Forcibly, our approach to reading has taken on new forms to accommodate a different way of life. The question is: For better or worse? Although books give us new ideas, spark discussions, and explore topics in detail, the same information can be delivered in a variety of formats. When it comes to exactly how we should absorbing books, the debate rages on. Let\u2019s take a look. Since the 1950s, speed reading has been touted as an effective way to get through reading material quickly. Scientists, psychologists, and teachers have come up with methods to increase reading speed, whether through manual tools or visual movements. At the World Championship Speed Reading Competition, top contestants can reach 1,000 to 2,000 words per minute. Six-time champion Anne Jones reached 4,200 words per minute at one point. Those rates seem phenomenal compared to the average adult\u2019s 300 words per minute. So then, what types of strategies are speed readers using? Here are four common methods: 1. Skimming involves quickly going through passages to find the main points. Instead of combing each word carefully, you go over first and last paragraphs, headings, and similar cues to find key ideas. Scanning, a similar method, involves running your eyes down the text to find certain words and phrases. 2. Meta guiding uses a pointer, such as your index finger or a pen, to guide your eyes along the lines of text. A pointer helps your eyes move horizontally, focusing on the word that you should be reading. 3. Vision span method uses the span of human eyesight to read words in batches. Readers focus their eyesight on one central word, and then use their peripheral vision to see adjacent words. By relying on our peripherals, it\u2019s believed that we can read about five words at once. 4. Rapid serial visual representation (RSVP) is a more recent technique where an electronic reading system displays words one at a time. You can choose the speed at which the words show up on the screen. While many readers stand by these methods, they\u2019re not without controversies. Skimming means that you lose out on the details of a piece. On the other hand, preliminary skimming and scanning can help you to quickly hone in on certain topics, and then read those passages in greater detail. In the comprehensive book Psychology of Reading, Keith Rayner dismisses speed reading techniques. He explains that we\u2019re constrained by the anatomy of our eyes and the ability of our brains to process information. While some techniques aim to eliminate the process of sounding words in our head to save time (otherwise known as subvocalization), Rayner states that our memory and comprehension levels decrease dramatically. As for the top speed reading contestants at the world championships, their comprehension rates tend to hover around 50 percent. While Anne Jones\u2019s 4,200 words per minute rate is impressive, her comprehension was at 67 percent, and she had been exposed to the material before. Regardless of which reading method you use, the evidence points towards the fact that speed comes at the sacrifice of understanding. Depending on what you\u2019re reading, this might not necessarily be a bad thing. If you\u2019re trying to get through a dry piece to capture a few key points, skimming makes sense. The RSVP method can work if you\u2019re going through a short piece that\u2019s easy to understand. Personally, I like using a pen to guide my eyes along the text. But if you\u2019re going through a difficult book or one that you want to savor and reflect on, it probably doesn\u2019t make sense to use methods that involve skipping or plowing through the material as fast as possible. A long time ago, there was only one option available: the traditional paper book. Nowadays, we can choose to read, watch, or listen to books. While there\u2019s the luxury of options, new questions arise, such as: How should we read a book? Is one format superior to the other? We\u2019ll look first at traditional books, then e-books, and finally, audiobooks. According to research, paper books have certain advantages over other formats. For one, readers have a better sense of progression when they can physically flip through pages. This progression also contributes to greater memory retention. Also, paper books act as effective sleeping aids, since they don\u2019t emit the blue light that electronic devices do. The other advantage to traditional books is a more personal preference. Some people like the feeling of paper. The pulpy smell, the weighty feeling, and the ability to flip through the pages enhance the reading experience. The drawback behind paper books, though, is that they\u2019re often heavier and more inconvenient to carry around than other types of reading formats. The greatest advantage e-books offer is convenience. Whether you carry one book or a hundred makes no difference in weight. This is useful for traveling, especially if you want more reading options. E-books also provide a sense familiarity, as we become accustomed to electronic devices such as smartphones and tablets. The big issue around e-readers, however, is the blue light effect. In one study, researchers found that people who read light emitting e-readers took longer to fall asleep than those who read paper books. Readers who used devices such as tablets, laptops, smartphones, and backlit readers reduced their levels of melatonin, a hormone that increases in the evenings and induces sleepiness. As a result, they experienced low-quality sleep and were tired the next morning. The good news is that e-ink readers are an exception. These devices emit light towards the screen to cast a glow, rather than directly shining a light towards the reader\u2019s eyes. The resulting effect is similar to a lamp shining onto a paper book. There is some skepticism behind audio, as some people feel that it doesn\u2019t provide the same level of immersion as reading. A study notes that you can absorb information almost as well through audio as reading (whether they\u2019re fully equal is another topic of debate). In some cases, the narrator\u2019s tone can even help listeners to better understand the meaning behind texts. The issue with audio, though, is that humans are prone to multi-tasking. If you\u2019re typing up an email or cooking a meal while listening to the narrator, the message can become lost. Personally, I like using audiobooks when I\u2019m less likely to be distracted, such as when waiting around or going for a walk. Lately, speeding through audiobooks has become popular. Some people zip through a book at 2x, or sometimes even 3x the regular speed. While they claim that no information is lost, should we be approaching material this way? A book is not simply an open box waiting to be checked off. Going through a book is an experience\u200a\u2014\u200aone that requires absorbing the material, reflecting on it, and coming out having learned something new. Similar to how creative moments happen during quiet periods, our insights from books happen during periodic pauses. Given the boom in e-readers, smartphones, and electronic devices in general, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that people are resorting to reading in different ways. As information goes digital, books have become easier to access. However, over things can be accessed easily as well. Videos are available on-demand. People can chat with friends across the world. Considering the countless options available at our fingertips, are books really more enticing than before? According to one survey in Japan, the longer people spent on their smartphones, the less time they spent reading books. Overall, 53 percent of respondents did not read a single book in the last month, consistent with rates in the previous five years. On a positive note, research has found an increase in reading from 17 to 21 percent after a holiday season where tablets and e-readers were popular gift choices. Around 43 percent of American adults have consumed long-form content in the past year, whether it\u2019s books, journals, or articles. The average e-reader, specifically, has read 24 books in the past 12 months, while a non-e-book reader has read 15 books. The places where people read books have changed as well. People are squeezing in bits of reading whenever they have a moment to spare, such as on the daily commute or in between tasks. Increasingly, people are reading while watching television or surfing the computer. Although people are increasingly reading in short spurts, the benefits from \u201cdeep reading\u201d are lost in the process. Reading in long periods helps the reader to enter a state similar to a hypnotic trance, in which the experience is most enjoyable. Interestingly, the reading rate actually slows down. In this state, the reader quickly decodes words while keeping a gradual pace, heightening the understanding and relationship between author and reader. Ideally, we would be able to read uninterrupted for hours at a time, under soft lighting, and free of all distractions. Unfortunately, most of us don\u2019t have that luxury on a daily basis. So how can we make the most out of what we read? Here are four solutions: Reading only when you have long, empty periods to spare can be difficult. We squeeze in books whenever we can, between work and relaxation. These factors make it hard to fully immerse ourselves. It makes sense, then, to categorize reading material according to your place and time. For instance, articles and light reads can be reserved for short periods. Books that require less focus can be listened to in audio format. Heavy reading material can be saved for those moments when you have long stretches of free time. Since I started making reading books a daily habit, I\u2019ve been able to: Optimal reading times include early in the morning, or right before sleep. Of course, you can fit in reading whenever, but I find these two times perfect for starting and ending the day. An easy way to begin this habit is by putting a book on your bedside table so that it\u2019s one of the first things you see after waking up and before going to sleep. If you\u2019re rusty on the reading, choosing a light, fun read can is an effective way to ease yourself into picking up a book. After watching the latest episode of your favorite show, have you felt the need to share your thoughts and opinions with fellow watchers? If so, why should books be any different? If you just finished reading a book you enjoyed, share it with someone who might like it as well. And if someone with similar tastes recommends a book to you, why not check it out? Going through similar experiences and bonding through books helps you become closer with others, creating a similar feeling to traveling together or watching the same film. A shared discussion can also help you to better understand and appreciate what you read. As I mentioned earlier, I don\u2019t like to simply zip through a book, check it off, and move onto the next one. When I do that, I find that I lose out on the implications behind the work. Instead, I use a few methods to absorb the material, including: Although some still resort to old-fashioned paper books, the traditional format is making way for a different style of reading. We\u2019re carrying hundreds of books electronically. We\u2019re listening to stories. We\u2019re watching events unfold on screen. Not only is the form changing, but so is our approach. We\u2019re increasingly cutting our activities into small segments, rushing to finish what we do, or trying to do everything at once. While it\u2019s almost impossible to push back against the tides of time, it\u2019s up to us to find methods to adapt and thrive in periods of change, both in reading and other facets of life.

Japan\u2019s reverence for kawaii, and its close association with femininity, demands that women speak in a high, singsong voice, that they use childlike gestures and expressions, and that they never, ever challenge a man. Those who go against the grain by exhibiting ambition, brains or strong opinions are disparaged for being too \u201caggressive.\u201d So, Obokata\u2019s apron deflected attention from her scientific prowess, and thanks to the media\u2019s efforts, became a woman who just happened to be a scientist: a Barbie with a pipette. To be kawaii is to be vulnerable, weak and powerless. \u201cCute\u201d is the opposite of capable. Sure, it\u2019s easy to like\u200a\u2014\u200aseeing cute things ignite our protective instincts and trigger the release of endorphins, which is why we spend so many hours watching furry baby animals rolling around helplessly on YouTube. But cute is hard to respect. As a result, Japan treats its women abysmally. Ranked 105 out of 136 countries for gender equality by the World Economic Forum, the country is constantly reminded by economists and foreign commentators like the IMF\u2019s Christine Lagarde that the low proportion of women in the workforce, specifically executive positions, has contributed to its two-decade economic malaise. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is optimistic that his \u201cWomenomics\u201d project will spur more women to join the workforce and rise to more senior positions. But merely building more nurseries and forcing companies to report on their number of female directors won\u2019t unravel the deeply sexist attitudes about how women should act and what social roles they are capable of playing. As the strongest wave of feminism in decades sweeps through the West, Japan is well overdue a movement of its own. But worryingly, many Japanese women don\u2019t seem to want to be empowered. Like Obokata, many embrace kawaii, playing dumb, clumsy and clueless to gain approval. A third of women aspire to be housewives. Over 70 percent quit their jobs when they have children. Who can blame them, when they\u2019re only trusted with making tea or answering the phone? In corporate Japan most women are treated like decorative robots. No wonder their ambitions atrophy. Obokata hung up her apron in April: It turned out her research was disproven, and her papers were retracted. Her supervisor even, tragically, committed suicide to \u201ctake responsibility.\u201d But while her fall from grace caused outrage and sadness in the wider scientific world, in Japan, it was easy to comprehend: Pretty girls shouldn\u2019t mess with science.

Let\u2019s travel back to the period between 1452 and 1519, to be more specific. Back to the time of the creative genius of Leonardo da Vinci. Let\u2019s get even more specific. Let\u2019s travel back to a regular morning for Leonardo during his most creative years. If you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ve seen a plethora of morning routine articles on Medium. Hell, I\u2019ve written one myself. Such is the significance of the manner in which you start your day. You know the next question already. How did Leonardo da Vinci start his mornings? After spending some (thoroughly enjoyed) hours on scrounging through the infinite lessons of gold to be found in his life story, I did manage to find exactly how Leonardo started his mornings, and how that went on to add more fire to his explosively creative mind. Starting with a list The moments leading to my discovery of this beautifully simple yet tremendously effective life-hack were very much like opening a box of blinding light while sitting in a pitch black room for me. I say that because of the profound disproportion of the impact this habit can potentially have, and how easy and simple it is to pick up and maintain. If you\u2019re obsessed with finding new ways to enhance yourself, you\u2019ll be blown away by the results of this habit just like I was. Ready? Here we go. Make a curiosity list every day. Yes. That\u2019s all you need to start. Make a list of things which arouse your curiosity. Things you want to explore. Things you want to learn more about. And it could be anything at all. From the color of the sky to the workings of a bicycle. From the internal structure of an atom to the shape of human teeth. From the beautiful cold winds by the beach to volcanoes spluttering out lava. Keep in mind that Leonardo had stuff like \u201chmm I wonder what a woodpecker\u2019s tongue looks like\u201d in his lists, so don\u2019t write off any curiosity as trivial. Anything at all. Just make a list. And then go explore. Go do, experiment, measure, feel, smell, wonder. Whatever brings to life that curiosity you have buried deep inside you. That same curiosity which was out in the open, breathing with passion when we were kids, before it got entombed under piles of \u201cworldly wisdom\u201d, practicality, responsibilities, and norms. Walter Isaacson, the prominent biographer credited with beautifully breaking down personalities as complex and impactful as Steve Jobs, Ben Franklin, and Leonardo himself, deems the curiosity of these figures as one of the biggest reasons why they were able to see the world as they did, and create what they created. This practice of making lists of fields we want to explore is like digging down to our lost curiosity, and bringing it to light once again. The golden connection Obviously, a person who is more curious about more things will end up exploring more and learning more. Take for example Ben Franklin. His Wikipedia page goes on to add more pillars to my first statement. Quite a handful, isn\u2019t it? Now, the people who have learned more, gain expertise in a lot of fields. But how does this connect to creativity? Let\u2019s take a lesson from Steve Jobs. Jobs took calligraphy in college; a course with no practical application to his life. It all came back later with Macintosh, the first computer with beautiful typeface, fonts, and calligraphy. He emphasized, as Walter Isaacson claims, the importance of having the knowledge of different fields to harness the full power of creativity. When you come to think about it, it really is obvious. Ideas emanate from the intersection of different blocks of knowledge: truths, beliefs, thoughts, and experiences. The more the variety and quantity of blocks you have, the more and better the ideas that you\u2019ll come up with. And, as Steve Jobs put it, the more you\u2019ll be able to harness the power of creativity. Voila! That is how being feeding and nurturing your curiosity helps you harness the power of creativity in a much fuller, better, and effective way. A summary To sum up this narrative from Leonardo wanting to check out some bird\u2019s tongue to Steve Jobs envisioning some of the most exciting products and technologies of our time, here\u2019s a simple and actionable list of steps: Keep in mind that Leonardo Da Vinci wasn\u2019t really considered to be \u201cgod-gifted\u201d. Many experts, including biographer Walter Isaacson claim that his creativity was a result of a conscious pursuit of new ideas and a never-ending curiosity. It\u2019s not beyond our reach, and the only limits we have are our own habits, beliefs and thoughts. It\u2019s time to break through them, and this list is a good start.

The professional avoids them as much as possible. The amateur gives into these distractions multiple times a day. The amateur craves dopamine like a junkie craves heroin. The professional recognizes that sources of distraction are toxic rocket fuel for resistance. The amateur engages trolls and argues with critics. The professional gets back to work. The amateur stops doing what got him there in the first place. The professional understands that momentum is the lifeblood of any creative endeavor. The amateur gets too high on his own bullshit. The professional focuses on the process over the prize. The amateur is overdependent on inspiration and hokey new age bullshit. The professional depends on habits. The amateur tries to change everything at once. The professional changes one habit at a time. The amateur shows up on occasion. The professional shows up every day. The amateur treats the deal he made with himself a negotiable contract. The professional abides by the terms of the contract. He honors his commitments. The amateur assumes the war of art is over, lets his guard down and gets his ass kicked. The professional realizes that we fight a daily battle in the war of art. Amateurs live by default. Professionals are deliberate, eliminate decision fatigue and spend the bulk of their time on deep work. There\u2019s a constant dance that occurs between being an amateur and a professional when you\u2019re a creator of any kind. On the worst of days, I check email way too many times. I give in to distractions. I consume more than I create. I get nothing done. I get to the end of the day and feel like I\u2019ve wasted precious hours of my one and only life. I play like an amateur. On the best of days, I block distractions. My life is optimized for deep work. I get tons of things done. I look back at the day and feel satisfied. I\u2019ve created more than I\u2019ve consumed. I play like a professional. Even the best of us give into the temptations of the amateur. It\u2019s not a one-time thing, some moment of enlightenment or movie scene where trumpets play when we turn pro. It\u2019s something we have to do every single day. Our moments of turning pro are mundane, ordinary and without fanfare of any sort. They are simply moments when as Steven Pressfield says \u201cstop running from our fears, turn around and face them head on.\u201d We sit down, put brush to canvas, fingers to keyboard, pen to paper and start to do our work. Rinse, wash repeat. And once you\u2019ve had a taste of turning pro, you\u2019ll realize how fulfilling it is. You\u2019ll want to experience more of it. It\u2019s addictive, kind of like dopamine, except the fulfillment you get from it lasts. Just because you played like an amateur yesterday, it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t play like a pro today. Turning pro isn\u2019t a one-time decision. It\u2019s a choice we have to make every single day. Join my newsletter to receive a weekly article like this one.

Given how long we\u2019re slated to live these days, you could definitively call this guy an early bloomer. All told, this guy didn\u2019t really have it all that bad. Sure, his wife left him six months earlier. And yeah, he only had a couple grand in the bank and was living on his friend\u2019s couch. Then there was that part about barely making $28k/yr working a dead-end job that was slowly sucking his soul. No doubt, that all sucks, but hey\u2026it could be worse. At least he had a friend with a couch. At least he had some money. At least he had a job. His problems didn\u2019t really have anything to do with his circumstances. Those were merely the symptom. The illness was something much different. The illness was something much worse. The thing that was really turning this guy around was this: For a long time he convinced himself he was happy. He settled for living in a state of quasi-contentment in his relationship with life, love, and work. He\u2019s not the only one. This is a pervasive problem, and it\u2019s not one isolated to a particular geography, age, gender, or socioeconomic status. So many of us simply don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going. How can this be? Well, it all stems from the fact that so many of simply don\u2019t know where we want to go. We\u2019re riding the carousel of life, mindlessly taking the next step put in front of us with little to no thought for: A) Where it\u2019s taking us, and B) If that is somewhere we really want to go. Never-mind the fact that it\u2019s a friggin\u2019 carousel and we\u2019re actually just spinning in circles. You need a degree to amount to anything in life, right? So you trudge your way into a crater of student debt, pursuing a degree that\u2019ll hopefully pay itself off sometime before you kick the bucket in 60 some odd years. But now answer this: How many people do you know who are actually using their college degrees in their current profession? I\u2019m not a big math guy, but let me drop a statistic bomb on you. A study conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2013 showed that only 26% of college graduates are using their degree in their chosen career. Think hard on that. 3 out of 4 people aren\u2019t using their degree. No doubt there\u2019s a conflux of contributing factors leading to that particular stat, but it can\u2019t be overstated that a great number of those individuals are not using their degree simply because they never bothered to map out their life. So here we are\u2026officially talking about Life Maps. Most of us are on society\u2019s version of the airport sliding-sidewalk. Go to college, get a degree. Get a job, any job. Start a family, squirt out a kid. Buy a house, live the American dream. Retire in bliss. I don\u2019t mean to denigrate that particular life-map. Remember the guy from earlier in this article? This was his life-map. He was well on his way. Until he wasn\u2019t. And when he finally got ejected from his trajectory, he was forced to reflect on where his life had taken him. That\u2019s a hard question to ask, because most of us only bother asking it once the wheels have come off. Too few of us proactively ask: How do I get where I want to go? As a result, we are not the drivers of our destiny. We are fate\u2019s play thing. So do yourself a favor (not the you you are now, by the way, but rather, the you you will be in 10, 20, 50 years from now), and take an hour tonight before bed to follow the four steps I\u2019ve outlined below. Reflect on your answers and dig deep until you discover the kernel of truth hiding at the center of your being. Remember: Plotting a life-map can be daunting. There\u2019s just so much terrain to cover. Many of us are simply so overwhelmed at the prospect of plotting a course across the ocean that we never set sail. But it doesn\u2019t have to be so stressful. You don\u2019t have to have every step along the path plotted. You do not need to prepare for every contingency. That would be impossible. And yet, that doesn\u2019t stop many of us from thinking that it must be so. So what are we to do? Where do we begin? Well, this might seem painfully obvious, but you begin with the end. That is, what\u2019s your final destination? What is the end-state you wish to achieve? Project yourself forward 50 years and imagine what a life well-lived means to you? Does it mean having built a Fortune 500 company? Does it mean being surrounded by a herd of grandchildren? Your end-state is unique to you. And therefore only you can do the requisite soul searching. I can not give you the answer. Nobody can. You must do the heavy lifting here and I won\u2019t lie, it\u2019s not easy. But it\u2019s necessary if you want to skid across life\u2019s home-plate with a big ol\u2019 smile on your face. So, step one is to decide this: What does a life well-lived mean to me? Now you have your what, but you\u2019re going to need a strong why if you want to maintain motivation through life\u2019s inevitable ups-and-downs. Did you decide that a life well-lived means being wealthy beyond measure? That\u2019s fine. Financial freedom is important. Now you have to understand why it\u2019s important to you. Is it because you like the social recognition? Do you like flaunting it over others? Well, that\u2019s a fairly shallow why because it\u2019s done from a place of personal ego that\u2019s dependent on the opinions of others. This has been proven by countless psychological studies to be a shallow well from which to pull. To sustain the sort of effort required to traverse your life-map, you must pull from a deeper place. Perhaps wealth, for you, is a merely a vehicle for empowering the lives of those around you. (Philanthropy is a much stronger starting point, sociologically speaking, than ego, by the way.) So the next step in creating a genuine life-map lies in your ability to cut through all the crap, and answer the question of why do I want this. Here\u2019s the hard truth: Most of us haven\u2019t spent enough time reflecting on this question to really answer it in a meaningful way. The first thing that pops into your head will probably sound good, by the way, but more often than not, I find people\u2019s first answer is not actually the true answer. That\u2019s okay. Finding your why means first finding a whole slew of things that are not your why. It\u2019s an iterative process. Don\u2019t be deterred. Keep searching. The why you choose will dictate the depth of motivation you are able to muster towards a task. If you want to learn the piano because it was your late-mother\u2019s favorite instrument, and you want to learn her favorite song because it makes you feel nearer to her whenever you play it, well\u2026 That\u2019s a pretty strong why. That\u2019s the sort of why with the power to motivate even on those days when you\u2019re tired, or burned out. That\u2019s the sort of why that\u2019ll see you through to the completion of your goal. Someday is not good enough. Stupid goals are no good. They must be SMART. We\u2019ll dive deep into goal setting in a future article, but for now let it suffice to say that SMART goals are the only types of goals you should bother setting. Anything else is not actually a goal. It\u2019s just a dream. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong. Deams can be good, but dreams alone won\u2019t get you to where you want to go. So for now, while pondering your life-map, I want you to consider when you want to achieve the thing you\u2019ve set for yourself. Do you want to go back to grad school to pursue a career that\u2019ll offer more financial freedom, or the ability to travel more extensively? Great. Set a date. It might be a date for when you want to have completed the goal. It might be a date for when you want to have started certain parts of the goal. It doesn\u2019t really matter when the goal is set for. What matters is that the when exists and that you hold yourself accountable to it. It\u2019s not enough to just say what you want to accomplish. You have to create an attack plan. For instance: I want to learn the piano is the what. I am going to buy a piano and practice one hour every day, is the how. Without the how, everything else is just meaningless fluff. After spending an evening determining your what, why, when, and how, put it all together into a personal statement. A challenge of sorts. The script goes as follows: By When, I will achieve What, by How, because Why. Final example for the evening, my friend, then you\u2019re on your own: It\u2019s a simple sentence. Zero fluff. But it contains everything you need to start setting goals, both in the near- and long-term. It contains everything you need to start setting landmarks for your life-map. Don\u2019t waste another day not knowing where you\u2019re going, how you\u2019re gonna get there, or why you\u2019re even bothering going in the first place. Spend one hour this evening before bed reflecting on your life up to this point. Consider all the steps you\u2019ve taken merely because it was the thing expected of you. Get off life\u2019s carousel and hit the road. And hey, don\u2019t forget to take your map. Thanks for reading!

I opened my laptop and posted to my new blog. This, though, was the first time in six years. And it nearly broke my heart. A few weeks earlier, I\u2019d been abruptly pardoned and freed from Evin prison in northern Tehran. I had been expecting to spend most of my life in those cells: In November 2008, I\u2019d been sentenced to nearly 20 years in jail, mostly for things I\u2019d written on my blog. But the moment, when it came, was unexpected. I smoked a cigarette in the kitchen with one of my fellow inmates, and came back to the room I shared with a dozen other men. We were sharing a cup of tea when the voice of the floor announcer\u200a\u2014\u200aanother prisoner\u200a\u2014\u200afilled all the rooms and corridors. In his flat voice, he announced in Persian: \u201cDear fellow inmates, the bird of luck has once again sat on one fellow inmate\u2019s shoulders. Mr. Hossein Derakhshan, as of this moment, you are free.\u201d That evening was the first time that I went out of those doors as a free man. Everything felt new: The chill autumn breeze, the traffic noise from a nearby bridge, the smell, the colors of the city I had lived in for most of my life. Around me, I noticed a very different Tehran from the one I\u2019d been used to. An influx of new, shamelessly luxurious condos had replaced the charming little houses I was familiar with. New roads, new highways, hordes of invasive SUVs. Large billboards with advertisements for Swiss-made watches and Korean flat screen TVs. Women in colorful scarves and manteaus, men with dyed hair and beards, and hundreds of charming cafes with hip western music and female staff. They were the kinds of changes that creep up on people; the kind you only really notice once normal life gets taken away from you. Two weeks later, I began writing again. Some friends agreed to let me start a blog as part of their arts magazine. I called it Ketabkhan\u200a\u2014\u200ait means book-reader in Persian. Six years was a long time to be in jail, but it\u2019s an entire era online. Writing on the internet itself had not changed, but reading\u200a\u2014\u200aor, at least, getting things read\u200a\u2014\u200ahad altered dramatically. I\u2019d been told how essential social networks had become while I\u2019d been gone, and so I knew one thing: If I wanted to lure people to see my writing, I had to use social media now. So I tried to post a link to one of my stories on Facebook. Turns out Facebook didn\u2019t care much. It ended up looking like a boring classified ad. No description. No image. Nothing. It got three likes. Three! That was it. It became clear to me, right there, that things had changed. I was not equipped to play on this new turf\u200a\u2014\u200aall my investment and effort had burned up. I was devastated. Blogs were gold and bloggers were rock stars back in 2008 when I was arrested. At that point, and despite the fact the state was blocking access to my blog from inside Iran, I had an audience of around 20,000 people every day. Everybody I linked to would face a sudden and serious jump in traffic: I could empower or embarrass anyone I wanted. People used to carefully read my posts and leave lots of relevant comments, and even many of those who strongly disagreed with me still came to read. Other blogs linked to mine to discuss what I was saying. I felt like a king. The iPhone was a little over a year old by then, but smartphones were still mostly used to make phone calls and send short messages, handle emails, and surf the web. There were no real apps, certainly not how we think of them today. There was no Instagram, no SnapChat, no Viber, no WhatsApp. Instead, there was the web, and on the web, there were blogs: the best place to find alternative thoughts, news and analysis. They were my life. It had all started with 9/11. I was in Toronto, and my father had just arrived from Tehran for a visit. We were having breakfast when the second plane hit the World Trade Center. I was puzzled and confused and, looking for insights and explanations, I came across blogs. Once I read a few, I thought: This is it, I should start one, and encourage all Iranians to start blogging as well. So, using Notepad on Windows, I started experimenting. Soon I ended up writing on hoder.com, using Blogger\u2019s publishing platform before Google bought it. Then, on November 5, 2001, I published a step-to-step guide on how to start a blog. That sparked something that was later called a blogging revolution: Soon, hundreds and thousands of Iranians made it one of the top 5 nations by the number of blogs, and I was proud to have a role in this unprecedented democratization of writing. Those days, I used to keep a list of all blogs in Persian and, for a while, I was the first person any new blogger in Iran would contact, so they could get on the list. That\u2019s why they called me \u201cthe blogfather\u201d in my mid-twenties\u200a\u2014\u200ait was a silly nickname, but at least it hinted at how much I cared. Every morning, from my small apartment in downtown Toronto, I opened my computer and took care of the new blogs, helping them gain exposure and audience. It was a diverse crowd\u200a\u2014\u200afrom exiled authors and journalists, female diarists, and technology experts, to local journalists, politicians, clerics, and war veterans\u200a\u2014\u200aand I always encouraged even more. I invited more religious, and pro-Islamic Republic men and women, people who lived inside Iran, to join and start writing. The breadth of what was available those days amazed us all. It was partly why I promoted blogging so seriously. I\u2019d left Iran in late 2000 to experience living in the West, and was scared that I was missing all the rapidly emerging trends at home. But reading Iranian blogs in Toronto was the closest experience I could have to sitting in a shared taxi in Tehran and listening to collective conversations between the talkative driver and random passengers. There\u2019s a story in the Quran that I thought about a lot during my first eight months in solitary confinement. In it, a group of persecuted Christians find refuge in a cave. They, and a dog they have with them, fall into a deep sleep. They wake up under the impression that they\u2019ve taken a nap: In fact, it\u2019s 300 years later. One version of the story tells of how one of them goes out to buy food\u200a\u2014\u200aand I can only imagine how hungry they must\u2019ve been after 300 years\u200a\u2014\u200aand discovers that his money is obsolete now, a museum item. That\u2019s when he realizes how long they have actually been absent. The hyperlink was my currency six years ago. Stemming from the idea of the hypertext, the hyperlink provided a diversity and decentralisation that the real world lacked. The hyperlink represented the open, interconnected spirit of the world wide web\u200a\u2014\u200aa vision that started with its inventor, Tim Berners-Lee. The hyperlink was a way to abandon centralization\u200a\u2014\u200aall the links, lines and hierarchies\u200a\u2014\u200aand replace them with something more distributed, a system of nodes and networks. Blogs gave form to that spirit of decentralization: They were windows into lives you\u2019d rarely know much about; bridges that connected different lives to each other and thereby changed them. Blogs were cafes where people exchanged diverse ideas on any and every topic you could possibly be interested in. They were Tehran\u2019s taxicabs writ large. Since I got out of jail, though, I\u2019ve realized how much the hyperlink has been devalued, almost made obsolete. Nearly every social network now treats a link as just the same as it treats any other object\u200a\u2014\u200athe same as a photo, or a piece of text\u200a\u2014\u200ainstead of seeing it as a way to make that text richer. You\u2019re encouraged to post one single hyperlink and expose it to a quasi-democratic process of liking and plussing and hearting: Adding several links to a piece of text is usually not allowed. Hyperlinks are objectivized, isolated, stripped of their powers. At the same time, these social networks tend to treat native text and pictures\u200a\u2014\u200athings that are directly posted to them\u200a\u2014\u200awith a lot more respect than those that reside on outside web pages. One photographer friend explained to me how the images he uploads directly to Facebook receive a large number of likes, which in turn means they appear more on other people\u2019s news feeds. On the other hand, when he posts a link to the same picture somewhere outside Facebook\u200a\u2014\u200ahis now-dusty blog, for instance\u200a\u2014\u200athe images are much less visible to Facebook itself, and therefore get far fewer likes. The cycle reinforces itself. Some networks, like Twitter, treat hyperlinks a little better. Others, insecure social services, are far more paranoid. Instagram\u200a\u2014\u200aowned by Facebook\u200a\u2014\u200adoesn\u2019t allow its audiences to leave whatsoever. You can put up a web address alongside your photos, but it won\u2019t go anywhere. Lots of people start their daily online routine in these cul de sacs of social media, and their journeys end there. Many don\u2019t even realize that they\u2019re using the Internet\u2019s infrastructure when they like an Instagram photograph or leave a comment on a friend\u2019s Facebook video. It\u2019s just an app. But hyperlinks aren\u2019t just the skeleton of the web: They are its eyes, a path to its soul. And a blind webpage, one without hyperlinks, can\u2019t look or gaze at another webpage\u200a\u2014\u200aand this has serious consequences for the dynamics of power on the web. More or less, all theorists have thought of gaze in relation to power, and mostly in a negative sense: the gazer strips the gazed and turns her into a powerless object, devoid of intelligence or agency. But in the world of webpages, gaze functions differently: It is more empowering. When a powerful website\u200a\u2014\u200asay Google or Facebook\u200a\u2014\u200agazes at, or links to, another webpage, it doesn\u2019t just connect it\u200a\u2014\u200ait brings it into existence; gives it life. Metaphorically, without this empowering gaze, your web page doesn\u2019t breathe. No matter how many links you have placed in a webpage, unless somebody is looking at it, it is actually both dead and blind; and therefore incapable of transferring power to any outside web page. On the other hand, the most powerful web pages are those that have many eyes upon them. Just like celebrities who draw a kind of power from the millions of human eyes gazing at them any given time, web pages can capture and distribute their power through hyperlinks. But apps like Instagram are blind\u200a\u2014\u200aor almost blind. Their gaze goes nowhere except inwards, reluctant to transfer any of their vast powers to others, leading them into quiet deaths. The consequence is that web pages outside social media are dying. Even before I went to jail, though, the power of hyperlinks was being curbed. Its biggest enemy was a philosophy that combined two of the most dominant, and most overrated, values of our times: novelty and popularity, reflected by the real world dominance of young celebrities. That philosophy is the Stream. The Stream now dominates the way people receive information on the web. Fewer users are directly checking dedicated webpages, instead getting fed by a never-ending flow of information that\u2019s picked for them by complex \u2013and secretive\u200a\u2014\u200aalgorithms. The Stream means you don\u2019t need to open so many websites any more. You don\u2019t need numerous tabs. You don\u2019t even need a web browser. You open Twitter or Facebook on your smartphone and dive deep in. The mountain has come to you. Algorithms have picked everything for you. According to what you or your friends have read or seen before, they predict what you might like to see. It feels great not to waste time in finding interesting things on so many websites. But are we missing something here? What are we exchanging for efficiency? In many apps, the votes we cast\u200a\u2014\u200athe likes, the plusses, the stars, the hearts\u200a\u2014\u200aare actually more related to cute avatars and celebrity status than to the substance of what\u2019s posted. A most brilliant paragraph by some ordinary-looking person can be left outside the Stream, while the silly ramblings of a celebrity gain instant Internet presence. And not only do the algorithms behind the Stream equate newness and popularity with importance, they also tend to show us more of what we\u2019ve already liked. These services carefully scan our behaviour and delicately tailor our news feeds with posts, pictures and videos that they think we would most likely want to see. Popularity is not wrong in and of itself, but it has its own perils. In a free-market economy, low-quality goods with the wrong prices are doomed to failure. Nobody gets upset when a quiet Brooklyn cafe with bad lattes and rude servers goes out of business. But opinions are not the same as material goods or services. They won\u2019t disappear if they are unpopular or even bad. In fact, history has proven that most big ideas (and many bad ones) have been quite unpopular for a long time, and their marginal status has only strengthened them. Minority views are radicalized when they can\u2019t be expressed and recognized. Today the Stream is digital media\u2019s dominant form of organizing information. It\u2019s in every social network and mobile application. Since I gained my freedom, everywhere I turn I see the Stream. I guess it won\u2019t be too long before we see news websites organize their entire content based on the same principles. The prominence of the Stream today doesn\u2019t just make vast chunks of the Internet biased against quality\u200a\u2014\u200ait also means a deep betrayal to the diversity that the world wide web had originally envisioned. There\u2019s no question to me that the diversity of themes and opinions is less online today than it was in the past. New, different, and challenging ideas get suppressed by today\u2019s social networks because their ranking strategies prioritize the popular and habitual. (No wonder why Apple is hiring human editors for its news app.) But diversity is being reduced in other ways, and for other purposes. Some of it is visual. Yes, it is true that all my posts on Twitter and Facebook look something similar to a personal blog: They are collected in reverse-chronological order, on a specific webpage, with direct web addresses to each post. But I have very little control over how it looks like; I can\u2019t personalize it much. My page must follow a uniform look which the designers of the social network decide for me. The centralization of information also worries me because it makes it easier for things to disappear. After my arrest, my hosting service closed my account, because I wasn\u2019t able to pay its monthly fee. But at least I had a backup of all my posts in a database on my own web server. (Most blogging platforms used to enable you to transfer your posts and archives to your own web space, whereas now most platforms don\u2019t let you so.) Even if I didn\u2019t, the Internet archive might keep a copy. But what if my account on Facebook or Twitter is shut down for any reason? Those services themselves may not die any time soon, but it would be not too difficult to imagine a day many American services shut down accounts of anyone who is from Iran, as a result of the current regime of sanctions. If that happened, I might be able to download my posts in some of them, and let\u2019s assume the backup can be easily imported into another platform. But what about the unique web address for my social network profile? Would I be able to claim it back later, after somebody else has possessed it? Domain names switch hands, too, but managing the process is easier and more clear\u2014 especially since there is a financial relationship between you and the seller which makes it less prone to sudden and untransparent decisions. But the scariest outcome of the centralization of information in the age of social networks is something else: It is making us all much less powerful in relation to governments and corporations. Surveillance is increasingly imposed on civilized lives, and it just gets worse as time goes by. The only way to stay outside of this vast apparatus of surveillance might be to go into a cave and sleep, even if you can\u2019t make it 300 years. Being watched is something we all eventually have to get used to and live with and, sadly, it has nothing to do with the country of our residence. Ironically enough, states that cooperate with Facebook and Twitter know much more about their citizens than those, like Iran, where the state has a tight grip on the Internet but does not have legal access to social media companies. What is more frightening than being merely watched, though, is being controlled. When Facebook can know us better than our parents with only 150 likes, and better than our spouses with 300 likes, the world appears quite predictable, both for governments and for businesses. And predictability means control. Middle-class Iranians, like most people in the world, are obsessed with new trends. Utility or quality of things usually comes second to their trendiness. In early 2000s writing blogs made you cool and trendy, then around 2008 Facebook came in and then Twitter. Since 2014 the hype is all about Instagram, and no one knows what is next. But the more I think about these changes, the more I realize that even all my concerns might have been misdirected. Perhaps I am worried about the wrong thing. Maybe it\u2019s not the death of the hyperlink, or the centralization, exactly. Maybe it\u2019s that text itself is disappearing. After all, the first visitors to the web spent their time online reading web magazines. Then came blogs, then Facebook, then Twitter. Now it\u2019s Facebook videos and Instagram and SnapChat that most people spend their time on. There\u2019s less and less text to read on social networks, and more and more video to watch, more and more images to look at. Are we witnessing a decline of reading on the web in favor of watching and listening? Is this trend driven by people\u2019s changing cultural habits, or is it that people are following the new laws of social networking? I don\u2019t know\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s for researchers to find out\u200a\u2014\u200abut it feels like it\u2019s reviving old cultural wars. After all, the web started out by imitating books and for many years, it was heavily dominated by text, by hypertext. Search engines put huge value on these things, and entire companies\u200a\u2014\u200aentire monopolies\u200a\u2014\u200awere built off the back of them. But as the number of image scanners and digital photos and video cameras grows exponentially, this seems to be changing. Search tools are starting to add advanced image recognition algorithms; advertising money is flowing there. But the Stream, mobile applications, and moving images: They all show a departure from a books-internet toward a television-internet. We seem to have gone from a non-linear mode of communication\u200a\u2014\u200anodes and networks and links\u200a\u2014\u200atoward a linear one, with centralization and hierarchies. The web was not envisioned as a form of television when it was invented. But, like it or not, it is rapidly resembling TV: linear, passive, programmed and inward-looking. When I log on to Facebook, my personal television starts. All I need to do is to scroll: New profile pictures by friends, short bits of opinion on current affairs, links to new stories with short captions, advertising, and of course self-playing videos. I occasionally click on like or share button, read peoples\u2019 comments or leave one, or open an article. But I remain inside Facebook, and it continues to broadcast what I might like. This is not the web I knew when I went to jail. This is not the future of the web. This future is television. Sometimes I think maybe I\u2019m becoming too strict as I age. Maybe this is all a natural evolution of a technology. But I can\u2019t close my eyes to what\u2019s happening: A loss of intellectual power and diversity, and on the great potentials it could have for our troubled time. In the past, the web was powerful and serious enough to land me in jail. Today it feels like little more than entertainment. So much that even Iran doesn\u2019t take some\u200a\u2014\u200aInstagram, for instance\u200a\u2014\u200aserious enough to block. I miss when people took time to be exposed to different opinions, and bothered to read more than a paragraph or 140 characters. I miss the days when I could write something on my own blog, publish on my own domain, without taking an equal time to promote it on numerous social networks; when nobody cared about likes and reshares. That\u2019s the web I remember before jail. That\u2019s the web we have to save.

He is also, as you may have learned over the past few days, a racist. The fire was stoked by LePage\u2019s racialized and sexualized gibberish\u2014in which he came up just short from declaring that Maine\u2019s heroin epidemic is not only leading to tragedies like overpopulated prisons and fatal overdoses, but to a phenomenon he seemed to find equally disquieting: interracial procreation. And it was fanned by just about every major news outlet, as well as Hillary Clinton, who condemned his \u201cracist rants.\u201d But the conflagration has already been reduced to embers. So it goes in America\u2019s news cycle: We reprimand the bigot, professing shock at comments that never actually shocked so much as reinforced our preconceptions about such figures. LePage, after all, is a Tea Party Republican with a history of imbecilic outbursts; when he offered a quasi-apology as twisted as his original offense, it gave us one last opportunity to roll our eyes in moral superiority before moving on. And so, in just 72 hours both LePage\u2019s remarks and the ensuing scolding have eclipsed the very story they should be illuminating: namely, the stubborn and sustained refusal of the hard right to understand the failure of the War on Drugs. Back in 2014, I spent months reporting for Rolling Stone on the heroin crisis in neighboring Vermont. The situation there is more or less identical to Maine\u2019s: both states present\u2014from a dealer\u2019s point of view\u2014 uniquely enticing opportunities. Throughout the 2000s there was a nationwide rash of abuse of pharmaceutical opiates, notably OxyContin, which was especially pronounced in rural areas where overworked doctors serving Medicare-reliant populations took to prescribing opiates as a quick-fix panacea. State and federal governments responded by enforcing more strident prescription guidelines, and pressuring the drug\u2019s makers to reformulate it so it couldn\u2019t be snorted or injected. The trouble was that this didn\u2019t account for the void it created: opiate addicts deprived of their fix, who represented a new market for heroin sales. Given New England\u2019s proximity to New York, the Northeast\u2019s main distribution hub for heroin, it was no surprise that dealers from the city began traveling north, where they can charge up to three times the price and conduct their business in places where law enforcement is scant. Heroin use has been on the rise just about everywhere in the United States, but in states like Maine and Vermont\u200a\u2014\u200awhere homogenous populations are spread throughout pastoral towns\u200a\u2014\u200ayou see its effects in stark, undiluted focus. While I was interviewing a recovering addict inside a Burlington Starbucks, for instance, he casually pointed out that the two people sitting next to us who were conducting a deal. Spending an evening with undercover cops driving through seemingly bucolic streets, they described the open air drug market the neighborhood had become. I may as well have been in an episode of The Wire. Given that some $2 million of heroin was being trafficked into Vermont each week, it shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise to see rehab clinics getting more foot traffic than farmers\u2019 markets. Where Vermont and Maine differ, though, is in their approach to the issue. Vermont\u2019s governor, Peter Shumlin, is a progressive Democrat who has become the national face of a more compassionate and nuanced outlook, treating drug addiction as a medical, rather than criminal, problem. Instead of shuffling petty users into the unforgiving claws of the criminal justice system, Shumlin has been expanding Vermont\u2019s treatment facilities while using law enforcement to focus on disrupting the major suppliers. \u201cThe theory has been that if we just arrest users and put them away, then we\u2019re going to make progress,\u201d Shumlin told me. \u201cPublic policymakers have refused to say not only that this has failed, but that it\u2019s failing miserably.\u201d It will take years to be able to gauge the results\u200a\u2014\u200aVermont, like the nation at large, continued to experience a rise in deaths from overdoses in 2015\u200a\u2014\u200abut the effort to change the culture has been applauded. Eric Holder, as attorney general, deemed heroin an \u201curgent public health crisis\u201d when he called for reducing mandatory minimums for minor drug charges in 2014. Last fall, Hillary Clinton used her current Presidential bid to introduce a plan for that would direct funds currently used for mass incarceration toward treating addiction. \u201cPlain and simple, drug and alcohol addiction is a disease, not a moral failing\u200a\u2014\u200aand we must treat it as such,\u201d she wrote in an op-ed for the New Hampshire Union Leader. On the other end of the spectrum you have an entrenched stalwart like LePage, who seems to not have gotten the memo that the War on Drugs, now in its fourth decade, has been a steady history of repeated defeat at staggering costs. When Shumlin was introducing his approach in 2014, LePage asked for increasing law enforcement presence to \u201chunt down dealers and get them off the street.\u201d And although 200 people died from overdoses in Maine in 2015, LePage recently threatened to veto a prospective drug fighting bill that he believed showed \u201cfavoritism\u201d to rehab. Spend time among heroin users and you quickly realize the absurdity of this. In Vermont, I sat inside a chain restaurant with a longtime addict who hadn\u2019t shot up in a few hours. He was poised, polite, and funny\u200a\u2014\u200ahardly the stereotype of the nodding-off junkie. He sat there, voicing what was taking place inside his body. \u201cGetting antsy,\u201d he said. \u201cGetting tense. A kind of sick feeling. Like, I\u2019ll start throwing up if I don\u2019t get some.\u201d This is how heroin users talk. They turn to the drug not to \u201cget high\u201d but to \u201cget well,\u201d the long term dangers masked by a quest for short term relief. At the time, he wanted to quit, but couldn\u2019t get a bed in a rehab center; he has since been accepted into one of Vermont\u2019s new facilities, and remains sober. So, as we condemn LePage for his racially-tinged idiocy, it\u2019s worth remembering that his comments are a reflection of an equally antiquated and unfortunate drug policy. LePage, oddly, even admitted this himself in recent days. While trying to extricate himself from the mess he created, he noted that when he cracked down on the over-prescribing of pharmaceutical opiates he didn\u2019t foresee that he was priming many of his most vulnerable constituents for heroin use. Rather than point fingers at the D-Moneys and Shifties of this world, in other words, he may want to take a look in the mirror. Photographs by Cheryl Senter.

She didn\u2019t have an answer, but she did share an anecdote. After Amy and her friend Max met me at a book party in SoHo, she received an email from a friend expressing his surprise that we had become friends. \u201cYou and Max are like Statler and Waldorf, heckling from the audience,\u201d Amy\u2019s friend wrote to her. \u201cTyler Coates is like Miss Piggy, preening on the stage.\u201d It was not the first time I had been accused of oversharing. I have been writing about myself online in some form since graduating from high school in 2001. My first attempts at blogging were on OpenDiary.com and Diaryland.com, two sites that focused more on journaling than writing for an audience, although there were clear social aspects to both. Then there was LiveJournal in college (my friends were the only people who read that one) and, post-graduation, Blogger. After joining Tumblr at the beginning of 2008, I used it as more of a scrapbook, casually posting and reblogging pictures and songs. But a year in, I changed my pseudonymous username to my own. Suddenly, because I was writing under my own name\u200a\u2014\u200amy first byline, really\u200a\u2014\u200athe criticisms changed. Even though I was hardly anonymous on my earlier blogs, my Tumblr had some deliberate accountability because my name was attached. Mixed in with the Liz Phair MP3s and pre-selfie-era selfies were brief posts about my feelings and emotions\u200a\u2014\u200atwo things that are never supposed to be put on the internet, I learned. I wrote about a lot of things in those early days on Tumblr: My dad had died of cancer, I was working in a miserable temp job that I hated, and I had been dumped just before Christmas. The communal nature of Tumblr offered some solace and support. I made a lot of friends based on the mutual pop-culture interests we were writing about, and a lot of those people crossed the email boundary and offered me emotional support. At the first Tumblr meetup I had ever attended, in Chicago in 2009, organized by a group of users who barely new each other offline, strangers told me how they found it inspiring that I would write about things they would never share on the internet. Oversharing never felt like the appropriate word for what I did\u2014it really is such an overused and misunderstood phrase. To overshare means simply to share anything the reader might not share him or herself. Our personal boundaries are subjective, so the term serves to attack a writer for doing what the accuser wouldn\u2019t: revealing something personal, something that makes the reader vulnerable. It carries with it the resentment that the person doing the revealing isn\u2019t embarrassed, even though the reader thinks the writer should be. Somehow we don\u2019t feel the same way about someone on stage: Performers are usually rewarded for their bravery, applauded for making themselves vulnerable. Bloggers, on the other hand, are seemingly hobbyists and amateurs, even if they\u2019re getting paid for their work. They are attention seekers trolling for personal kicks and pleasure. There\u2019s a fine line for any performer: Who they are on the stage and who they are in the wings. That invisible barrier between the footlights and the front row of the audience is nonexistent for people who perform on the internet. But I felt like I\u2019ve been playing a character all this time\u200a\u2014\u200aor at least a heightened version of myself. I have what I call my 80/20 Rule, a theory based entirely on presumption and not at all mathematical. (If I were good at math, I\u2019d be in a different business.) The premise is essentially this: Everything you know about someone based on what they put on the internet represents about 20 percent of who he or she really is, while the other 80 percent is not actually present in that online persona. On the other hand, the 20 percent you put out there can be perceived as 80 percent of your inner life, maybe even more. Years ago, my boyfriend bemoaned the bravado I used on the internet. He still points it out sometimes, suggesting that the person I am on the internet is not always the person I am in my relationship with him. When I recently asked what bothered him about it, he replied, \u201cIt seemed like you were using personal experiences to gain approval from \u2018the internet\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200athis wider audience\u200a\u2014\u200aand I wondered why the approval of your friends and family wasn\u2019t enough. It felt like a distorted version of you.\u201d When I co-starred in a web series called Disappointing Gay Best Friend with Mikala Bierma, we unintentionally played on this very notion. Mikala was the moronic girl who wanted a gay of her own. I was the boring, dull gay guy who didn\u2019t want to go clubbing with her. Most of the mean comments were directed Mikala\u2019s way, but a few described me as \u201cstraight-acting\u201d and \u201cself-loathing.\u201d My IRL friends know that I won\u2019t shut up about musical theater, so to call me straight-acting is absurd. But I realized that we don\u2019t always get to pick the identities others prescribe us. We do, however, have to find comfort in understanding that how we see ourselves is not how we present to other people. About two years ago, after a big, bad breakup, I deleted my Tumblr account for good. An online platform to express my roller coaster of emotions only opened me up to criticism from the same people who enjoyed taking advantage of my pain. Instead of using the internet as my therapist, I went to a real one. Instead of letting anonymous commenters tell me what I should do with myself, I listened to one professional with whom I was able to share all sides of the situation\u200a\u2014\u200anot just the parts I wanted her to hear. As I learned to manage my emotions simply through the fundamental process of understanding them, I cared less and less about documenting the process on the internet. I don\u2019t need to write to know what I\u2019m feeling anymore, which has given me something I didn\u2019t have on Tumblr: a vantage point that offered more of a complete perspective. I can find old blog posts today and barely recognize the 20-something who wrote them. Maybe in a few years I\u2019ll feel the same way about this essay. The 80/20 Rule can be applied to ourselves, too, and maybe that\u2019s the most important part: To benefit from self-reflection, we also need to see ourselves as others do.

Esalen is the perfect place for a Digital Detox. You soak naked in natural hot springs atop the cliffs of Big Sur, overlooking the Pacific Ocean, feeling the kiss of the sun on your skin. At night, you can see every star in the sky. Each morning, dozens of Monarch butterflies say hi on your way to a delicious breakfast of yogurt, morning miso, and freshly picked greens from the Esalen garden, as you sip your coffee watching the whales pass by. Our Digital Detox Retreat included daily meditations, journaling, reflections about our relationship to technology, and interactive playshops like vulnerability through body painting, creative writing on typewriters, nutrition, reclaiming your whole self, improv, and a puzzle-filled team-building scavenger hunt. Participants said the experience of taking two days off their devices helped them, \u201cfind my power again,\u201d \u201cremember the power of human connection,\u201d \u201cbegin the journey of reconnecting with myself,\u201d \u201cclear my thoughts,\u201d \u201crealize that tech has greatly contributed to my anxiety,\u201d \u201cremember how good it was to really feel things,\u201d \u201cand remember how important it is to simply ask a stranger how their day is going.\u201d One couple who had met at Esalen a year ago even got engaged during the retreat! Even though I\u2019ve been to Camp Grounded thirteen times over the past five years, the struggle to maintain a healthy relationship with technology is real. Last month, I found myself falling into familiar bad habits: sleeping with my iPhone in my bedroom, checking my phone first thing in the morning (which means I\u2019m scrolling through Instagram and Bumble before I\u2019ve even brushed my teeth!), and watching Netflix in bed after 11pm. Tech addiction has become an epidemic, and finally the tech giants are starting to sound the alarm. 61 percent of people admit to being addicted to the internet and their devices, heavy internet users are 2.5 times more likely to be depressed, 67 percent of cellphone owners find themselves checking their device even when it\u2019s not ringing or vibrating, and 33 percent of people admit to hiding from friends and family to check social media. The average employee checks 40 websites a day, switching activities 37 times an hour, changing tasks every two minutes. Perhaps most alarming is new research on skyrocketing teen suicide rates, which link a 33 percent increase in U.S teens ages 13 to 18 who feel useless and joyless (classic symptoms of depression) to the prevalence of the smartphone. In our closing circle, one participant shared that he thought of his tech use like the waves of the ocean. Sometimes life requires you to be crashing into the shore, and using your devices a lot. But you also need time drift back out to sea, and take time offline. There needs to be an ebb and flow. It\u2019s amazing what can happen when we take even just a short rest from our devices. Time offscreen can contribute to reduced anxiety, stress, depression, and fatigue. Other results can include an increase in creativity and efficiency, enhanced teamwork, gratitude, personal growth, and even better sleep. You don\u2019t need to pay for an expensive retreat to have a Digital Detox. Here are a few ways to bring balance back to your everyday life, adapted from the Digital Detox Field Guide by Levi Felix, Brooke Dean, and Zev Felix. If you need support incorporating a few of these habits into your routine, trying finding an accountability buddy to text you (or check-in with you IRL!) on your progress. Don\u2019t wake up to your phone, buy a $10 alarm clock. Give yourself time in the morning to wake up and start the day on your terms before getting distracted by email, Facebook, and media notifications. Exercise, meditate, have coffee or tea, eat breakfast with a loved one, before you go online. Carry a journal with you. Write down your thoughts, ideas, visions, and things you want to look up later. Instead of taking photos, draw or write about what you see. Studies show you\u2019re more likely to retain the moment by working your memory than by posting a pic. Try not to use your devices in the bathroom. Time on the toilet is a good time to think or read a magazine, not to swipe right. One of six phones has traces of E. coli fecal matter on their screen\u2026 is shexting really worth it? At least 1/10 of people admit to checking their phone during sex. Keep an intimate moment intimate. When you bring a cellphone into bed, you\u2019re bringing the whole world with you. Charge your phone outside of the bedroom. Turn off push notifications you get from email, social media, and apps. Be intentional about when you want to check your messages and alerts. Don\u2019t let the beeps and buzzes of the online world pull you from the moment you are enjoying. Set certain times of the day for doing different tasks like using Facebook, reading online articles, and checking non-critical email. Keep these websites closed during other parts of the day. If someone sends you a link to a cool article or funny video, check it during your scheduled media time, not as soon as you get the link. Avoid \u201cblack-hole tech loops\u201d and \u201cworking out of your Inbox\u201d by managing your time. Unoccupied and unplanned moments are where the magic happens. Serendipity can lead to incredible opportunity, meeting someone special, or creative insight. Explore your city or neighborhood. Take a hike in the woods. Watch the sunrise or sunset. Go for walks during the workday. Take a nap or a coffee break. Studies show taking frequent breaks from work increases focus, creativity, and well-being, and that being outside in nature increases memory and retention. The average American spends 1/3 of their leisure time online. Instead, do more things you want to do, learn and explore. Time offline is a great way to break creative blocks and write your book, make art, finish that book you\u2019re reading, or launch a new project. Set meal times as an opportunity to connect with your food, the people around you and yourself. Appreciate where your food came from and the people who planted, harvested, transported and prepared it. Be grateful for the company you\u2019re sharing a meal with and leave your phones off the table. Take one day a week with no digital technology, devices, or screens. If that\u2019s too much, start with taking an afternoon or an evening off, or even an hour. It\u2019s been proven that even taking 10 minute breaks between work and screens, can improve productivity dramatically. Glowing screens decrease the release of sleep hormone melatonin by up to 22 percent, resulting in less deep sleep, lowered REM cycles, and more restlessness at night. According to Harvard University, sleeping less than six hours a night is the leading case of burnout. 95 percent of people bring their phone to bed. Let\u2019s break that trend by setting a tech curfew an hour or two before bed every night. Give someone a hug with consent. A 9\u201320 second hug can give you a mega dose of oxytocin\u200a\u2014\u200aand lower stress levels. Balance the dopamine and oxytocin that we\u2019re getting from Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and push notifications, with real human interaction. Say thank you more often. Practicing gratitude regularly can lead to more energy in life, resulting from higher levels of activity in the hypothalamus and release of feel-good hormones like norepinephrine and neurotransmitters like dopamine. As Levi Felix, the founder of Digital Detox, would say, \u201cLet\u2019s make and take the time to look up from our screens, celebrate humanity in the present, and give ourselves time the chance to take big deep breaths. We\u2019re flying through space at 66,000 mph on a huge island-dotted-swimming pool called Earth\u200a\u2014\u200aand that alone is amazing.\u201d To learn more about Digital Detox and Camp Grounded, and find out when the next retreat is happening, sign-up for updates at campgrounded.org.

We had spent nearly all of 2016 revamping a core feature and we were excited about what we\u2019d built. But shortly after the release, our design director found a discussion thread on Designer News. The top commenter quoted the first two lines of our About page (which says the company was founded in 2006), then wrote: Ouch. After 12 years in business, I\u2019ve developed a fairly thick skin. I know how the internet works. Some people are kind, some are mean, and others are just blunt\u200a\u2014\u200alike that top post. Still, the comment bothered me. Our company predates all the competition, and we have 3.2 million users. I also know that we\u2019re not exactly popular in the startup world. JotForm is bootstrapped, and we\u2019ve never taken any outside investments. We don\u2019t hang with the cool kids. And chances are you\u2019ll never see us on the top of TechCrunch, announcing our latest funding round. But, if people thought the competition was better, could we change that perception? Our competitors are more popular in the startup world, but did that mean we should follow their lead? Because we launched in 2006, our users work in a diverse range of industries, including more \u201ctraditional\u201d fields such as non-profits, law, finance, accounting, and big corporations. If we indulged our FOMO and imitated the competition, our product might not work for those users. But, we operate in a hyper-competitive industry where even Google has stepped into the ring. That can be daunting. While it was tempting to panic and chase the trends, we ultimately decided to stay in our lane. We would take our time and innovate\u200a\u2014\u200aideally without alienating our customers in the process. It worked. Innovating on our own terms brought us over a million new signups throughout the last year. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned from listening to your customers instead of chasing the competition. Criticism can be good for business. It can inspire you to stretch and innovate. But once you come up with something new, you can\u2019t just impose it on current users out of the blue (even if all the \u201ccool kids\u201d are doing it). If you make sudden, un-requested changes, you risk losing customer trust and loyalty. That\u2019s a big deal. Instead of forcing change, it\u2019s important to: 1. Release new versions or major feature changes to a small test group. 2. Establish a clear way to measure user reactions. This could be a number, a behavior, or another metric that shows how customers really feel about the change. The team and I thought a lot about that discussion thread. After deciding not to mimic our rivals, we had a new mission: We started with three hack weeks. These are five-day sprints where designers, developers and other product groups focus exclusively on a single idea or problem. Our cross-functional product teams were told to unleash their creativity. To think big and broad and wild. After a fourth hack week, we had a promising new design. That prototype eventually became JotForm Cards, which we released today. But first, we started testing. When people signed up for a new account, 50% received the new forms and 50% got the old design. If these new users logged into their account or worked on forms within a month after signing up, we considered them an \u201cactive user.\u201d That was our success criteria. People who received the new card-style forms were 30% less likely to become active users. We were disappointed. We tried changing the colors, the default background, and key parts of the form design. We tried everything. The results were still dismal. We ran email surveys and gathered feedback from our site. Most people still preferred our traditional approach. We talked about it and came up with a new testing strategy: Apparently, showing 50% of our new users the new forms and the other 50% the old design didn\u2019t work. But instead of forcing change, what if we created one more user group and gave them the ability to choose? So we decided to split our new users into three categories: We ran this test for a month and expected the old design to win again. People who could choose their form style were 20% more likely to become active users. We dug into the data. A large percentage wanted our traditional forms, a smaller group wanted the new ones, and most people were even happier to have the choice. It was a big lesson for us\u200a\u2014\u200aand one that I\u2019ve had to re-learn several times in 12 years of running this company: As I mentioned earlier, many of our customers work in fields like law, non-profit, education, finance, and accounting\u200a\u2014\u200aand these users overwhelmingly preferred the classic design. If we\u2019d simply released our new design and forced it on users, it would have been a huge disaster. We would have lost customers and maybe even damaged our brand. We realized that flexibility matters. Our users need the ability to choose. Now, we have some customers who use both the classic and the new form styles, depending what they\u2019re working on. That makes the product better for them. And we wouldn\u2019t have realized this if we had blatantly copied our competitor\u2019s one-question-at-a-time style. Focusing on the customer, not the competition, also means taking a closer look at how you run your customer support division. Many companies think support teams exist solely to resolve tickets and answer tedious questions. Instead, customer support is a critical function, because it lives at the centre of product innovation. Your support team should be empowered to speak up, contribute to the innovation pipeline, and take the initiative to investigate customer issues, rather than robotically resolving one ticket after another. Lots of people have criticized Slack, for example, because they have five times more support reps than salespeople. But it took Slack just over a year to move from launch to a $1 billion valuation. It\u2019s now bigger than comparable startups with massive sales teams. We\u2019ve taken a similar approach. JotForm has no sales reps, but we have 35 customer support staff who work all over the world. They\u2019re available 24/7, 365 days a year, and the average response time is 1.5 hours. This is what it means to serve the customer, instead of chasing the competition. Here\u2019s another example. Technically advanced users often ask to edit our CSS. We\u2019ve empowered our support team to help improve the product, so they began to independently investigate these requests. We learned which customizations were helpful and updated the product accordingly. Without the support team\u2019s insights, we would have launched a big and unnecessarily complicated CSS editor. When you empower your customer support team, there\u2019s no limit to what you can learn from your customers. Together you can make the product so much better. A year after I read that comment thread, here\u2019s what we know: most people don\u2019t actually prefer our competitors or their product style. We know this because we have the data to support it. It\u2019s true that some people haven\u2019t heard of us, but we had almost a million new signups in 2017 alone, and our growth shows no signs of slowing. Our customer retention rate is strong. There are certainly haters and people who don\u2019t like our approach, and that\u2019s fine. We\u2019ve learned how to serve our loyal users. And for those who prize a fresh, design-savvy style, now we have a solution for them. We\u2019re trying. We\u2019re listening and learning\u200a\u2014\u200aall the time. Most importantly, our competition motivates us to be better. They inspire our team to work harder. Without opposing players and dissenting voices, we might not have stretched ourselves to innovate. The bottom line? There\u2019s room for everyone to raise the bar in this online world. As 2018 ramps up, here\u2019s something else I know: // Thanks for reading. .

It was a lovely Sunday morning, enjoying my morning espresso with sun shining over my shoulders. I pressed send. I was sitting on my couch at home, with my wife still asleep upstairs. I\u2019d finally completed my sneaker design for my new book, Brand Intervention: 33 Steps to Transform the Brand You Have into the Brand You Need. Very simply, Gary had inspired me with his new sneakers coming, I thought, \u201cDamn, if Gary is coming out with a sneaker, my book\u2019s gonna get a sneaker.\u201d Less than 15 minutes later, Gary replied with three words, \u201cI want it.\u201d I was stunned. So I replied asking Gary Vee his shoe size. I never heard back. Now, get this: this was a prototype. The color choices for the sneakers were deliberately in your face and consistent with the cover I\u2019d designed for the book. Early feedback on the book cover outstanding, and impossible to confuse with any other book. Plus it looked great when displayed small when shown on Amazon and online uses. (Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, you\u2019ve already seen it, but just in case, here it is at right.) The above Gary Vee quote inspired my next steps. Gary opened the door, and I was going to step in. So, after investigating the cost to produce a prototype of sneakers, I chose a plan B. The plan B had a number of steps: So, the real question is, is Gary going to invite me over to his NYC office to hangout together, shoot the shit, and share this hustle with the world? Gary, I\u2019m ready when you are.

I\u2019ve published more than twenty custom skills on the Amazon Alexa platform, and last year published my first Facebook Messenger chatbot named Chuck. I measure success by how much users are educated or entertained by the bot. The best KPI\u2019s for this are retention, and depth of the dialog. Here is my latest insight in how this applies to applications written for Facebook Messenger. The NLU and orchestration layer is written using AWS Lex, as well as AWS Lambda functions written in NodeJS. The ideal chatbot is what we saw with the HAL 9000 in A Space Odyssey. Just a blinking cursor or microphone that we can ask any question. No constraints, just answers. In applying this to software tools around Facebook Messenger, here is what that architecture looks like. Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models are good at deciphering user requests, and few scale issues. What limits applications is how many features can be written to support the thousands of different requests users make. Once those features proliferate, the challenge becomes discovery of the features\u200a\u2014\u200awhat the bot \u201cknows\u201d. A blinking cursor has limitless options, but a cold conversation starter. Users will have expectations based on the branding of the bot, but little else. Traditional visual applications handle feature discovery by providing menus and widgets on a device screen that provides options. An effective chatbot needs an approach for this as well. A good approach is to provide context with each response to the user, providing hints at what is possible. Building discovery into the responses encourages dialog, and actively engages the user. Back in December, I began adding buttons to my Facebook Messenger bot in an effort to improve the usability. This was in response to a lack of growth in usage. My bot was growing in features, as it ingested more data and algorithms to manipulate it. Without users knowing of it\u2019s newfound capabilities, it was stuck. I tried different ways of advertising the features on the Facebook Page, but none were effective. For example, I saw trivial gains through posting video demonstrations of the bot demonstrating new features. Similar results were achieved when writing articles in the news feed. Adding buttons into the bot responses did provide the lift I was looking for. Buttons augment responses by providing clear direction to the user on what\u2019s possible. Let\u2019s start by the initial response the bot has when the user initiates a conversation with \u201cHello\u201d or an introduction. Scripting clear language in the response is important, including providing a sample phrase (i.e. \u201cHow many calories in a Chicken Sandwich\u201d.) Adding buttons takes this a step further, and proves far more effective. All a user needs to do is click one, and another response is coming their way. It also saves the user time for typing the potential requests. Mobile devices are tricky to navigate spelling and users tend to abbreviate sentances. Buttons simplify the user experience. Now for seeing the progress. I use the analytics tools within Facebook to track detailed usage. It is essential for measuring feedback for changes made within the app. Here\u2019s an example dashboard that is provided if you haven\u2019t used before. The first success metric is around depth of the dialog. I want users to be educated with my bot. This can be quantified by tracking how many times a given user replies back and forth with the bot before exiting. Here is the chart tracking the amazing growth after I added buttons. More than double the activity per user. The next success metric is around retention. If a user believes they received useful information, they will be back. The easiest view on this is around weekly retention, and daily statistics shows similar success. The first week retention numbers are almost double since I added buttons. Less successful has been the second week retention which is slightly down. Sample size for week 2+ isn\u2019t significant with these cohorts, but will be a trend to monitor in the next month as this grows. The biggest limitation is the amount of screen space that buttons take up. The chat dialog becomes overwhelmed with the space being consumed, and with Messenger, there is no font size to shrink this. History of the session gets lost from immediate viewing, but the user can scroll back. Messenger renders up to three buttons at once, so there is the potential that users limit their thinking to only what they can click. Here is an actual dialog talking about pizza. These buttons can constrain users thinking, and skew results towards what is presented. For example, the bot knows about Domino\u2019s, but is not picked at the same frequency as those rendered as buttons. I attempt to phrase the label above the buttons to highlight this\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cClick button below or type response.\u201d Buttons are an essential part of designing a chatbot. It introduces some visual constraints, but worth a doubling of retention and transaction depth.

At their big, gushy heart, however, they\u2019re about one thing: female wish fulfillment. There\u2019s the wish that the girl and (usually) the boy will overcome the adorable obstacles and fall in love, of course. But there\u2019s also the wish that everyone will look and feel fantastic doing it. In real life, these levels of fantasticness usually cost a lot of money. So how does money function in romantic comedy? Over the years, rom-coms have evolved; by design, they reflect the gender politics and social concerns of the day, even when they\u2019re attempting to provide an antidote to them. The screwball comedies of the \u201930s gave way to musicals of the \u201960s leading eventually to the high-concept Meg Ryan-y blockbusters of the \u201990s. In 2014, the traditional romcom hasn\u2019t exactly died, but it\u2019s mostly moved, to television and independent film. And while TV\u2019s crop looks a whole lot like the \u201990s-era ones with upwardly mobile attractive people, the indie rom-coms reflect an indie sensibility: namely, that broke-ass people can fall in love, too. Here\u2019s a look at the evolution of the rom-com, via your wallet: For Love: Wealthy Irene Bullock (Carole Lombard) comes across a \u201cforgotten man\u201d named Godfrey (William Powell) and hires him to be her spendthrift family\u2019s butler, promptly falling in love with him.Or Money: Thanks to secretly highborn Godfrey\u2019s crafty investments, the Bullock family is saved from their reckless spending. Godfrey\u2019s windfall is so great that it even allows him to open a swinging nightclub called The Dump, on the spot where he lived when he was homeless. This is where, in the last scene, Irene marries him against his will. For Love: Flighty socialite Susan (Katharine Hepburn) falls for paleontologist David (Cary Grant) and schemes to keep him from his imminent wedding by involving him in the care and then the search for her brother\u2019s leopard, Baby.Or Money: David goes along with Susan\u2019s hijinks only because he wants her old-moneyed aunt to donate $1 million dollars to keep his museum open. In the end, the aunt gives the money to Susan, who in turn gives it to David as they declare their love for each other. Fun fact: Today that $1 million would be equal to about $17 million. For Love: As Tracy Lord (Katharine Hepburn), Philadelphia society girl, prepares for her wedding to George Kitteridge, her ex-husband C. K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant) and newspaperman Macaulay \u201cMike\u201d Connor (James Stewart) show up to complicate matters.Or Money: On the eve of her wedding, Tracy is torn between her self-made fianc\u00e9, her social-equal ex-husband, and a wealth-despising tabloid reporter whom she has only just met. In the end, even the poor newspaperman admits that Tracy\u2019s ex-husband is a pretty great guy, while her jealous fianc\u00e9 condemns Tracy, Dexter, and their \u201cwhole rotten class.\u201d During a time (the Great Depression) when money was a devastating problem for pretty much everyone, all three of these films feature heiresses who don\u2019t have to give it a second thought. Who knows how much Tracy Lord\u200a\u2014\u200abased on real-life Philadelphia railroad heiress Helen Hope Montgomery Scott\u200a\u2014\u200awas really worth. But it\u2019s a decent guess her father probably hit the $1 million tax bracket. In both Baby and Godfrey, beautiful, wealthy women are repeatedly rejected by the men they pursue. Sure, okay, these guys just aren\u2019t that into them. But, no matter, because wealth has also given them the ability to be deeply silly women with no regard for social rules, and thanks to their entitlement and lack of common sense, they persist. While it may seem retrograde (because, you know, it is) that these women are often unfathomably stupid and subservient (Katharine Hepburn, acting a fool!), it is actually only through their wealth and corresponding power\u2014even if that power comes from willful daftness\u2014that they\u2019re able to manipulate their less well-off men. Wish fulfilled! In The Philadelphia Story, social order is restored when a high society woman nearly weds a self-made man, but by breaking down the social(ist) defenses of a muckraking reporter, she realizes it is her alcoholic, good old boy ex-husband she truly loves. And honestly, it is super romantic. I mean, Cary Grant! Still, not only wealth but class is the topic of this movie, and how much of it the truly already-rich have. So, while absolutely everyone is in love with the heiress\u2014despite politics, despite divorce\u2014in the end she is able to reject the safe, stable choice and even the romantic, impoverished choice and run off with the handsome, super rich mistake she\u2019s already made, back to the yacht they both loved so much. For Love: Journalist Annie (Meg Ryan) hears architect Sam (Tom Hanks) on a radio call-in show talking about his deceased wife, realizes her upcoming wedding to allergic, awkward Walter (Bill Pullman) is lacking a certain \u201cmagic,\u201d and writes the stranger a letter proposing they meet at the Empire State Building on Valentine\u2019s Day.Or Money: Sam is able to impulsively quit his job in Chicago at the start of the movie and move to Seattle, while Annie uses the cover of her job to pay for stalking Sam. For Love: When destiny-obsessed Faith (Marisa Tomei\u2014she\u2019s no Meg Ryan but she might as well be) is just a little girl, she asks a Ouija board for the name of her soulmate, and it answers: Damon Bradley. Decades later, as her wedding to her mild podiatrist fianc\u00e9 approaches, a Damon Bradley calls out of the blue. On impulse, she takes her best friend and sister-in-law Kate (Bonnie Hunt, the perpetually underrated best friend and Judy Greer of the \u201990s) to Italy to track him down. Or Money: Faith, a teacher, and Kate, who is in school, take a last minute flight to Venice, rent a car to drive to Rome, and stay in a series of lavish hotels (including one Joan Collins stayed in) on Kate\u2019s husband\u2019s credit card. At one point Faith suggests renting a truck with a loudspeaker. For Love: Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) and Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) are pen pals who met in an AOL chat room.Or Money: Unbeknownst to either, Kathleen and Joe are business rivals\u2014his Barnes & Noble-esque megastore is opening around the corner from the small children\u2019s bookshop she owns. In Sleepless, Meg plays a journalist; one who uses her position at the Baltimore Sun Times to finance the full-scale stalking of Tom Hanks\u2019s Sam. She puts a background check, a private eye, and a flight from Maryland to Washington state on the paper. (Good to know: A journalist in Baltimore in 1992 made about $31, 297, which today is approximately $53,098.05.) How does her editor (Rosie O\u2019Donnell) not yell at her for that? She doesn\u2019t even interview him, she just stares at him from the middle of the street and then flies home. Meanwhile, Sam is able to pick up his young son and move to a houseboat in an entirely new city. Very reasonable choice! The film\u2019s attitude toward money could probably be summed up by one scene: Tom Hanks needs to steal a stranger\u2019s cab to chase his son, Jonah, to the Empire State Building. To get the cab, he yells, \u201cMoney, all right? Money, money, money!\u201d while throwing bills in the air. Money: People want it and this can be annoying, but it\u2019s plentiful, never a problem to come by. Only You, a forgotten classic that I will hype forever even though Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s fast-talking charmer is named Mr. Wright, is awash in pricey grand gestures. Faith\u2019s expenditures include a spur-of-the-moment flight to Venice, a rental car, multiple gorgeous hotel rooms in different cities, and a handful of dinners in lovely, expensive restaurants. Also, on her teacher\u2019s salary\u2014$35, 813 in 1992, about $57,520.95 today\u2014she apparently already had a wardrobe full of stunning, often-backless gowns. Her Mr. Wright is a lower-level shoe salesman who: gifts a woman who already rejected him a pair of fancy shoes (not knockoffs); hires an actor at the last minute in a country he\u2019s never been to; outfits said actor with a wig and gold medallion; and rents hotel rooms for them both\u2014in a hotel Joan Collins stayed in, no less. The phone calls alone must have cost him a fortune. The planning, the scheming, the cost! Money is just water in these films. It\u2019s everywhere and therefore not particularly notable, and this functions most strangely in You\u2019ve Got Mail. In the film, which is a flawless and charming example of the parallel reality of rom-coms, Kathleen Kelly is being run out of business by Fox Books. Of course, of course, this is their central conflict. But never are finances mentioned. A small business owner was making about $47,064.78 in 1998 (about $68K today), but this impending closure is a tragedy for sentimental reasons only: the loss of Kathleen\u2019s store is equated to the loss of her late mother\u2014who founded it\u2014and the loss of her beloved, oddball employees. But unemployment, financial ruin: these things are never on the table. She\u2019s not in danger of losing the apartment she used to share with her now-ex-boyfriend (double rent and no income, no problem!) or any of her sweater sets. It\u2019s also worth mentioning, that in this film it is Tom Hanks\u2019s father\u2014 not Tom Hanks\u2014who owns the houseboat. But of course, there is a houseboat. For Love: After a devastating breakup, comedian Donna Stein (Jenny Slate) has a one-night stand with finance guy Max (Jake Lacy), resulting in an unwanted pregnancy. As Donna struggles with her upcoming abortion, Max tries to prove himself to be a real candidate for her affections.Or Money: Besides her breakup, Donna is also reeling from the closing of the bookstore where she works. Although she is attempting to make it as a commercial actress, she occasionally borrows money from her mother and has outstanding student loan debt. A struggling comic like Donna pulls in about $500 a year from standup, and about $20,000 from a part-time job. As such, her abortion is a financial hardship as well as an emotional one, although the particulars are not discussed. For Love: Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) meets Albert (James Gandolfini) at a party where she also meets Marianne (Catherine Keener)\u2014a new client, a new friend, and Albert\u2019s ex-wife.Or Money: Eva works as a massage therapist after her divorce, and makes frequent comments on the fabulousness of other people\u2019s homes, clothes, and lives. Meanwhile her best friend Sarah (Toni Collette) struggles with such issues as how to fire her maid. For Love: Wallace (Daniel Radcliffe) meets Chantry (Zoe Kazan) at a party and falls for her, before discovering she has a boyfriend. When she asks him to be her friend, he says yes, determined to keep this fantastic woman in his life, convinced they can be \u201cjust friends.\u201dOr Money: Wallace dropped out of medical school after a bad breakup, works a menial job, and lives with his sister. Chantry is a well-regarded designer, but resists a promotion thanks to a fear of change and success. In What If, Daniel Radcliffe\u2019s Wallace lives with his sister and Chantry relies on her lawyer-boyfriend to fund their standard-issue gorgeous, rom-com apartment. Neither have the high-powered careers of rom-coms past. In Enough Said, Eva falls in middle-aged love with television historian Albertt, whose ex-wife calls him a loser. That ex-wife is also Eva\u2019s client and new friend, Marianne, a wildly successful poet with a gorgeous house and impeccable style and Catherine Keener\u2019s face, hair, and cool-lady voice. Meanwhile, Eva carries her massage table up steep staircases and deals with her clients\u2019 bad breath. She doesn\u2019t want to be a loser, no matter how much she might feel like one, so she finds herself picking at Albert\u2019s flaws and hiding her connection to him and Marianne. Donna Stein (Jenny Slate), from this summer\u2019s Obvious Child, is younger than Eva and still working on a dream, but is nonetheless, a bit of a \u201closer,\u201d in standard movie terms. She\u2019s unemployed (when the bookstore she works in closes down, it\u2019s bad for the employees\u2014for more than purely sentimental reasons), saddled with student loan debt, and in need of $500 for an abortion. She wears her roommate\u2019s clothes and her mother\u2019s shoes and borrows money from her parents. Like the \u201990s movies, Donna\u2019s financial situation is just the water, but now the water is boiling. Getting the money for her abortion isn\u2019t a plot point (does she borrow it from her best friend, Sleepless in Seattle\u2019s Gabby Hoffman? Her parents? Who knows.), but we are made to understand that it\u2019s part of a growing financial burden. So. Are we less ambitious today, less interested in money and privilege? Not if the ambitions and interests of these characters are any indication\u2014Eva never passes up an opportunity to covet and Donna plugs away at her stand-up career, even during times when nothing seems funny. In the end, even What If\u2019s Chantry takes the promotion she was so afraid of. These women don\u2019t already have it all; they are still trying, they are still on their way. It\u2019s not that women want less, we just want our fantasies to meet us halfway. The wish being fulfilled in these movies isn\u2019t rebooting entirely as a flighty, irresponsible heiress or even determined small business owner, but experiencing the thrill of the accidental run-in, the pain of that first misunderstanding, and the joy of the big, corny \u201cI love you\u201d speech all alongside our credit card debt and career struggles and pull-out futons. The wish is being good enough already. Follow Matter on Twitter | Like us on Facebook | Subscribe to our newsletter By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

But is that time well spent? News is by definition something that doesn\u2019t last. And as news has become easier to distribute and cheaper to produce, the quality has decreased. Rarely do we stop to ask ourselves questions about what we consume: Is this important? Is this going to stand the test of time\u200a\u2014\u200asay, in a week or in a year? Is the person writing this someone who is well informed on the issue? \u2014 Nicolas Carr There are several problems with the way we consume news today: First, the speed of news delivery has increased. We used to have to wait to get a newspaper or gossip with people in our town to get our news, but not anymore. Thanks to alerts, texts, and other interruptions, news find us almost the minute it\u2019s published. Second, the costs to produce news have dropped significantly. Some people write 10 or more blog posts a day for major newspapers. It\u2019s nearly impossible to write something thoughtful on one topic, let alone 10. Over the course of a year, this works out to writing 2400 articles (assuming four weeks of vacation). The fluency of the person you\u2019re getting your news from in the subject they\u2019re covering is near zero. As a result, you\u2019re filling your head with surface opinions on isolated topics. Because the costs have dropped to near zero, there is a lot of competition. Third, producers of news attempt to hijack our brains. News producers perpetuate a culture of \u201ctune in, don\u2019t miss out, follow this or you\u2019ll be misinformed, oh wait, look at this!\u201d As you consume more and more of that kind of news, you have less and less time for what matters. Fourth, the incentives are misaligned. In part, because there is a lot of competition, most news outlets feel compelled to offer free news. After all, everyone else is doing it. However, when the news is free, you still need to pay people, so you move away from a subscription model that was selling static ads to a captive audience to a model that\u2019s selling the audience to advertisers. Page views become the name of the game, and the more, the better. For a lot of people who create news (I won\u2019t use the term \u201cjournalists\u201d here because I hold them in high regard), the more page views they get, the more they are compensated. A lot of these ads aren\u2019t just impressions; they\u2019re also giving information about you to the advertisers, but that\u2019s another story. I could go on, but I think you\u2019re starting to see the picture now. \u2014 Herbert Simon The point is, most of what you read online today is pointless. It\u2019s not important to your life. It\u2019s not going to help you make better decisions. It\u2019s not going to help you understand the world. It\u2019s not going to help you develop deep and meaningful connections with the people around you. The only thing it\u2019s really doing is altering your mood and perhaps your behavior. The hotels, transportation, and ticketing systems in Disney World are all designed to keep you within the theme park rather than sightseeing elsewhere in Orlando. Similarly, once you\u2019re on Facebook, it does everything possible, short of taking over your computer, to prevent you from leaving. But while platforms like Facebook play a role in our excessive media consumption, we are not innocent. Far from it. We want to be well informed. (More accurately, we want to appear to be well informed.) And this is the very weakness that gets manipulated. \u2014 Nassim Taleb I have a friend who reads The New Yorker, The New York Times, The Economist, The Wall Street Journal, her local newspaper, and several other publications. She\u2019s addicted. She wants to know everything that\u2019s going on everywhere and to have an informed opinion. She\u2019s just like the rest of us\u200a\u2014\u200awe all want to know what\u2019s going on and have a well-informed opinion. If we\u2019re not well informed, then what are we? I don\u2019t want to be ignorant, and that\u2019s just how I\u2019m made to feel if I\u2019m not keeping up. Despite that, I\u2019ve stopped consuming news. At first, it was really difficult. When my friends would start talking about something topical and emotionally charged and ask me what I thought, I\u2019d have to say I don\u2019t know. This was followed by a \u201cWhat!?\u201d and \u201cYou have to read this\u201d as they took out their phones to text me a link to an article I would never read. One hilarious aspect of this situation is that they often expected me to stop the conversation with them and read the article so I could share in their outrage. No thanks. Being well informed isn\u2019t regurgitating the opinion of some twenty-two-year-old with no life experience telling me what to think or how outraged to be. Your first thought on something is usually not yours but someone else\u2019s. When all you do is consume, you are not only letting someone else hijack and direct your attention; you are also letting them think for you. Avoid the noise because it messes with the signal. Your attention is valuable, it\u2019s the most valuable thing you control. So why spend so much time on stuff that will be irrelevant in a few days? Learn to read the right way, this will help you remember what you read. Read what stands the test of time. Read from publications that respect and value your time, the ones that add more value than they consume. Read what prompts you to think for yourself. Read fewer articles and more books. Read books that have stood the test of time, those that are still in print after 20 years or so. And\u00a0, learn the big ideas from multiple disciplines. We\u2019re afraid of silence, afraid to be alone with our thoughts. That\u2019s why we pull out our phones when we\u2019re waiting in line at a coffee shop or the grocery store. We\u2019re afraid to ask ourselves deep and meaningful questions. We\u2019re afraid to be bored. We\u2019re so afraid that to avoid it, we\u2019ll literally drive ourselves crazy consuming pointless information. Let\u2019s close with this quote by Winifred Gallagher: \u201cFew things are as important to your quality of life as your choices about how to spend the precious resource of your free time.\u201d This article originally appeared on Farnam Street, a website dedicated to mastering the best of what other people have already figured out.

One question I often get asked is, \u2018how do I write a good opening?\u2019 Of course, this isn\u2019t just a question asked by high school students\u200a\u2014\u200aI see many aspiring authors ask the exact same question on writing forums! Before I share my thoughts on this, let\u2019s take a look at the opening lines from a few of my favourite books\u2026 You\u2019re just lucky I stopped with three, as I could easily have included the beginnings of hundreds of books I love. However, I do believe they all have similar qualities. Every single one of these opening paragraphs makes the reader ask questions. Why is that important? So that they keep reading in order to figure out the answers, of course! In the opening chapters of The Girl with all the Gifts, we wonder why the children\u2019s names are selected from a list. This isn\u2019t normal, is it some sort of boarding house perhaps? We also wonder who Miss Justineau is, and why Melanie likes the name Pandora. Of course, if you\u2019ve read the book, you find that the allusions to Pandora\u2019s box are numerous (even the title is the literal translation of Pandora) and incredibly significant to the little girl. Similarly, in that intriguing opening to The Hunger Games, we are left with the foreboding image of \u2018the reaping.\u2019 We know that her sister has crawled into bed with her mother because of some sort of event which happens a) regularly and b) causes bad dreams. However, we are no closer to understanding what this event might be. In fact, by the time we work out that they are selecting children to fight to the death, we are already a few chapters in and well-and-truly hooked. Clever. Sea of Rust is also a fascinating book. I am slightly ashamed to admit that I was first drawn in by the cover, but it is pretty outstanding (the cover, and the story). See, isn\u2019t it divine! Anyway, in the opening paragraph we wonder who \u2018she\u2019 is, that the narrator keeps referring to. We also question why there is a flash of green on the horizon. The description of the setting is similarly bleak, which raises more questions than answers as well. I often proofread a story and discover that the introductory paragraphs seem to have no real significance to the overall plot. What I really like about the three opening paragraphs above are that they all hint at events and ideas which are incredibly important to the characters and often drive the narrative. I\u2019ve already talked about how the allusion to Pandora\u2019s Box is a repeated motif throughout The Girl with all the Gifts. And if you\u2019ve read The Hunger Games, you will know that the reaping is the catalyst for Katniss being a participant in the games and changing her life trajectory forever. Then there\u2019s Sea of Rust, where the magic in the sunset is described and analysed several times, and the book even ends with the narrator hoping to see the flash one last time. Now this one is really important. First your reader looks at the cover. If it\u2019s interesting enough, they pick the book up, turn it over and read the blurb. Sound alright? Now they open your book and start reading the opening lines. Is the voice captivating? If not, that book will be put right back on the shelf where it came from. Should we judge books by covers and blurbs? Possibly not, even if we do. Should we judge a book by the opening paragraph? Hell, yes! If the narrative voice isn\u2019t captivating at the beginning, why would we bother reading more? Out of the excerpts above, I particularly like the way that Melanie\u2019s younger perspective is communicated by the sentence structure and language choices. Read over it again and notice the narrative voice. Now consider your own character\u200a\u2014\u200awhat sort of perspective are you wanting to impart? The opening paragraphs of your story are incredibly important. Make it intriguing for your reader. Include significant elements which will be investigated further in the body of your story. And make sure the narrative voice is strong and communicates the perspective you want to impart. You can read more advice about making your writing flow here.

His spirit is unwavering. As he begins to talk, he comes across as one of the few sages of sport. He\u2019s learned the lessons of success and failure the hard way. Andre\u2019s intelligence doesn\u2019t appear to be of an intellectual kind but more of an emotional kind. Having read his book, it\u2019s clear that Andre has had his fair share of adversity. What I loved though was that Andre said, \u201cAdversity builds character.\u201d This sentence became clear because as Andre spoke, his exceptional character shone through brightly. The scoreboard of Andre\u2019s life seems to have gone in his favor the more he has chosen to live the right way. When he was making poor choices, the scoreboard in tennis went against him. The deeper the conversation became with Andre on stage, the more apparent it became that he believed that success was about how you went about life. The part of Andre\u2019s interview that most resonated with the audience was when he said that, \u201cwe all live different experiences but our lives are the same.\u201d Andre\u2019s life could easily be perceived as the ultimate experience. As it turns out, he suffered the same challenges as normal people do. In fact, it could be argued that his problems were even worse than the average person\u2019s. The final mantra that Andre described, which hit me in the face like a cold shower, was that \u201cInstead of surviving, we should learn to thrive.\u201d Why settle for mediocre? Everything we go through in life is our choice, and we can achieve whatever we want as long as we make fabulous choices. Seeing Andre live seemed like a strange coincidence because I had only just finished reading his book \u201cOpen\u201d a few weeks prior. Everything happens for a reason I guess. Life is not about winning against other people; it\u2019s about winning against yourself. How do you do that? By trying to be just 1% better than you were the day before. The small steps are where the seemingly big steps of growth come from. Your mind plays a big part in your life, and it can often be your invisible opponent until you see its importance. Use your minds weaknesses to leverage your strengths. We all feel a vast variety of emotions each day. The people that act on the negative one\u2019s too often become the criminals and the people that can control the negative one\u2019s become the champions like Andre. Feeling and thinking mean nothing. It\u2019s what you do with your thoughts and feelings that determine your success. The best way to live life at the highest level is to take more action in the direction you want to go. If your dream is to be phenomenal at sport, then take action towards achieving this goal. While everyone else is out drinking, you need to be working towards your goal. When feelings arise, and they will, use them to your advantage and manipulate them towards your advantage. The worlds counting on you to do something courageous, extraordinary, and brave. That\u2019s how champions like Andre are born. Throughout Andre\u2019s book, he describes many times his hate for the sport of tennis. It\u2019s clear by the end that he is able to deal with his hatred of tennis because he has learned to love it for the meaning it gives him, the income he earns which helps him do more good, and the sport\u2019s ability for him to help others with their own struggles and injustices. While I don\u2019t think doing something you hate is to be advised, I do see through Andre\u2019s eyes that any struggle can help construct your mindset. Without adversity, you won\u2019t have the building blocks for success. You need a varied experience, with plenty of challenges, to have any chance of achieving the extraordinary. Sitting at home thinking about what you want to do and talking about it will never make your dream come true. Go out there and pursue it despite what others tell you! In the book, Andre describes what it\u2019s like to win and lose a major tennis game. While I would have thought that winning is something that he would focus on, Andre describes winning as very anti-climatic. He explains that losing is the hardest part because it lasts ten times longer than the winning feeling. We\u2019ve all experienced this in our lives where we reach a significant milestone and then think to ourselves, \u201cIs this all there is?\u201d We expect the good feeling of winning and achieving to last a long time, but it never does. This fact always seems to surprise us every time like we didn\u2019t already know it to be true. Remember that everything we do in life is typically to chase some positive feeling. One of Andre\u2019s career challenges was that he was trying to hit a winning ball every time. Towards the end of his career, he learned that not winning every ball, and remaining steady and consistent was far more crucial to him winning. In life, being perfect at everything you do is the same. Rather than win at every task you do, try to remain consistent and concentrate on getting just that little bit better with a solid routine of habits. The odd lesson we get from Andre\u2019s book is just how little becoming number one in the world at something changes your reality. When Andre describes becoming number one, he says that he feels nothing. Even when he wins some important games, he describes the feeling as only lasting a short time. You can\u2019t rely on winning to be your day-to-day motivation. You have to be able to live a fantastic day every day even if you haven\u2019t won or achieved anything significant. If you become addicted to feeling that winning feeling, then you are certain to fail and fall off a cliff at some point. Andre\u2019s trainer Gil in the book becomes very sick, and he learns a life-changing lesson. The lesson he learns is that fighting our pain and relieving other people\u2019s pain is why we\u2019re here. We\u2019re put on this planet to help people with their struggles rather than just focusing on our own. When we help people through their struggles, it helps us with our own. Fighting through the pain is the only thing we can do. If we surrender to it, then our progress goes backwards, and we run the risk of terminating our existence. Once you discover how to end people\u2019s pain you, unlock the infinite wisdom that Andre himself has tapped into. It\u2019s not about you; it\u2019s about others. Fear never goes way, and it\u2019s part of our genetic makeup. Without fear, we would lose the fire to succeed at our dream. When we become fearless, we become unmotivated and on the brink of failure. Let fear motivate you rather than stop you from getting where you want to go. There\u2019s nothing interesting about constant success. We all get excited when we see someone struggle and then get to experience their comeback. We\u2019ve all fallen from grace at some stage in our life, and the journey back to the top is where all the growth and positive feelings lie. We can all identify with struggle and it\u2019s what glues us all together as one. We can all see a part of ourself in Andre\u2019s comeback and struggles. As usual, the book finishes with some wise words from a woman (Andre\u2019s wife, Stefanie). She explains that when we think too much, we block ourselves from achieving our goal. We have to learn to use our intuition and feel our way through challenges. Over-thinking is the symptom for most of the time\u2019s I\u2019ve failed at something, and I\u2019m sure you can relate. There\u2019s a time for thinking, and there is a time for feeling.

I opened my laptop and posted to my new blog. This, though, was the first time in six years. And it nearly broke my heart. A few weeks earlier, I\u2019d been abruptly pardoned and freed from Evin prison in northern Tehran. I had been expecting to spend most of my life in those cells: In November 2008, I\u2019d been sentenced to nearly 20 years in jail, mostly for things I\u2019d written on my blog. But the moment, when it came, was unexpected. I smoked a cigarette in the kitchen with one of my fellow inmates, and came back to the room I shared with a dozen other men. We were sharing a cup of tea when the voice of the floor announcer\u200a\u2014\u200aanother prisoner\u200a\u2014\u200afilled all the rooms and corridors. In his flat voice, he announced in Persian: \u201cDear fellow inmates, the bird of luck has once again sat on one fellow inmate\u2019s shoulders. Mr. Hossein Derakhshan, as of this moment, you are free.\u201d That evening was the first time that I went out of those doors as a free man. Everything felt new: The chill autumn breeze, the traffic noise from a nearby bridge, the smell, the colors of the city I had lived in for most of my life. Around me, I noticed a very different Tehran from the one I\u2019d been used to. An influx of new, shamelessly luxurious condos had replaced the charming little houses I was familiar with. New roads, new highways, hordes of invasive SUVs. Large billboards with advertisements for Swiss-made watches and Korean flat screen TVs. Women in colorful scarves and manteaus, men with dyed hair and beards, and hundreds of charming cafes with hip western music and female staff. They were the kinds of changes that creep up on people; the kind you only really notice once normal life gets taken away from you. Two weeks later, I began writing again. Some friends agreed to let me start a blog as part of their arts magazine. I called it Ketabkhan\u200a\u2014\u200ait means book-reader in Persian. Six years was a long time to be in jail, but it\u2019s an entire era online. Writing on the internet itself had not changed, but reading\u200a\u2014\u200aor, at least, getting things read\u200a\u2014\u200ahad altered dramatically. I\u2019d been told how essential social networks had become while I\u2019d been gone, and so I knew one thing: If I wanted to lure people to see my writing, I had to use social media now. So I tried to post a link to one of my stories on Facebook. Turns out Facebook didn\u2019t care much. It ended up looking like a boring classified ad. No description. No image. Nothing. It got three likes. Three! That was it. It became clear to me, right there, that things had changed. I was not equipped to play on this new turf\u200a\u2014\u200aall my investment and effort had burned up. I was devastated. Blogs were gold and bloggers were rock stars back in 2008 when I was arrested. At that point, and despite the fact the state was blocking access to my blog from inside Iran, I had an audience of around 20,000 people every day. Everybody I linked to would face a sudden and serious jump in traffic: I could empower or embarrass anyone I wanted. People used to carefully read my posts and leave lots of relevant comments, and even many of those who strongly disagreed with me still came to read. Other blogs linked to mine to discuss what I was saying. I felt like a king. The iPhone was a little over a year old by then, but smartphones were still mostly used to make phone calls and send short messages, handle emails, and surf the web. There were no real apps, certainly not how we think of them today. There was no Instagram, no SnapChat, no Viber, no WhatsApp. Instead, there was the web, and on the web, there were blogs: the best place to find alternative thoughts, news and analysis. They were my life. It had all started with 9/11. I was in Toronto, and my father had just arrived from Tehran for a visit. We were having breakfast when the second plane hit the World Trade Center. I was puzzled and confused and, looking for insights and explanations, I came across blogs. Once I read a few, I thought: This is it, I should start one, and encourage all Iranians to start blogging as well. So, using Notepad on Windows, I started experimenting. Soon I ended up writing on hoder.com, using Blogger\u2019s publishing platform before Google bought it. Then, on November 5, 2001, I published a step-to-step guide on how to start a blog. That sparked something that was later called a blogging revolution: Soon, hundreds and thousands of Iranians made it one of the top 5 nations by the number of blogs, and I was proud to have a role in this unprecedented democratization of writing. Those days, I used to keep a list of all blogs in Persian and, for a while, I was the first person any new blogger in Iran would contact, so they could get on the list. That\u2019s why they called me \u201cthe blogfather\u201d in my mid-twenties\u200a\u2014\u200ait was a silly nickname, but at least it hinted at how much I cared. Every morning, from my small apartment in downtown Toronto, I opened my computer and took care of the new blogs, helping them gain exposure and audience. It was a diverse crowd\u200a\u2014\u200afrom exiled authors and journalists, female diarists, and technology experts, to local journalists, politicians, clerics, and war veterans\u200a\u2014\u200aand I always encouraged even more. I invited more religious, and pro-Islamic Republic men and women, people who lived inside Iran, to join and start writing. The breadth of what was available those days amazed us all. It was partly why I promoted blogging so seriously. I\u2019d left Iran in late 2000 to experience living in the West, and was scared that I was missing all the rapidly emerging trends at home. But reading Iranian blogs in Toronto was the closest experience I could have to sitting in a shared taxi in Tehran and listening to collective conversations between the talkative driver and random passengers. There\u2019s a story in the Quran that I thought about a lot during my first eight months in solitary confinement. In it, a group of persecuted Christians find refuge in a cave. They, and a dog they have with them, fall into a deep sleep. They wake up under the impression that they\u2019ve taken a nap: In fact, it\u2019s 300 years later. One version of the story tells of how one of them goes out to buy food\u200a\u2014\u200aand I can only imagine how hungry they must\u2019ve been after 300 years\u200a\u2014\u200aand discovers that his money is obsolete now, a museum item. That\u2019s when he realizes how long they have actually been absent. The hyperlink was my currency six years ago. Stemming from the idea of the hypertext, the hyperlink provided a diversity and decentralisation that the real world lacked. The hyperlink represented the open, interconnected spirit of the world wide web\u200a\u2014\u200aa vision that started with its inventor, Tim Berners-Lee. The hyperlink was a way to abandon centralization\u200a\u2014\u200aall the links, lines and hierarchies\u200a\u2014\u200aand replace them with something more distributed, a system of nodes and networks. Blogs gave form to that spirit of decentralization: They were windows into lives you\u2019d rarely know much about; bridges that connected different lives to each other and thereby changed them. Blogs were cafes where people exchanged diverse ideas on any and every topic you could possibly be interested in. They were Tehran\u2019s taxicabs writ large. Since I got out of jail, though, I\u2019ve realized how much the hyperlink has been devalued, almost made obsolete. Nearly every social network now treats a link as just the same as it treats any other object\u200a\u2014\u200athe same as a photo, or a piece of text\u200a\u2014\u200ainstead of seeing it as a way to make that text richer. You\u2019re encouraged to post one single hyperlink and expose it to a quasi-democratic process of liking and plussing and hearting: Adding several links to a piece of text is usually not allowed. Hyperlinks are objectivized, isolated, stripped of their powers. At the same time, these social networks tend to treat native text and pictures\u200a\u2014\u200athings that are directly posted to them\u200a\u2014\u200awith a lot more respect than those that reside on outside web pages. One photographer friend explained to me how the images he uploads directly to Facebook receive a large number of likes, which in turn means they appear more on other people\u2019s news feeds. On the other hand, when he posts a link to the same picture somewhere outside Facebook\u200a\u2014\u200ahis now-dusty blog, for instance\u200a\u2014\u200athe images are much less visible to Facebook itself, and therefore get far fewer likes. The cycle reinforces itself. Some networks, like Twitter, treat hyperlinks a little better. Others, insecure social services, are far more paranoid. Instagram\u200a\u2014\u200aowned by Facebook\u200a\u2014\u200adoesn\u2019t allow its audiences to leave whatsoever. You can put up a web address alongside your photos, but it won\u2019t go anywhere. Lots of people start their daily online routine in these cul de sacs of social media, and their journeys end there. Many don\u2019t even realize that they\u2019re using the Internet\u2019s infrastructure when they like an Instagram photograph or leave a comment on a friend\u2019s Facebook video. It\u2019s just an app. But hyperlinks aren\u2019t just the skeleton of the web: They are its eyes, a path to its soul. And a blind webpage, one without hyperlinks, can\u2019t look or gaze at another webpage\u200a\u2014\u200aand this has serious consequences for the dynamics of power on the web. More or less, all theorists have thought of gaze in relation to power, and mostly in a negative sense: the gazer strips the gazed and turns her into a powerless object, devoid of intelligence or agency. But in the world of webpages, gaze functions differently: It is more empowering. When a powerful website\u200a\u2014\u200asay Google or Facebook\u200a\u2014\u200agazes at, or links to, another webpage, it doesn\u2019t just connect it\u200a\u2014\u200ait brings it into existence; gives it life. Metaphorically, without this empowering gaze, your web page doesn\u2019t breathe. No matter how many links you have placed in a webpage, unless somebody is looking at it, it is actually both dead and blind; and therefore incapable of transferring power to any outside web page. On the other hand, the most powerful web pages are those that have many eyes upon them. Just like celebrities who draw a kind of power from the millions of human eyes gazing at them any given time, web pages can capture and distribute their power through hyperlinks. But apps like Instagram are blind\u200a\u2014\u200aor almost blind. Their gaze goes nowhere except inwards, reluctant to transfer any of their vast powers to others, leading them into quiet deaths. The consequence is that web pages outside social media are dying. Even before I went to jail, though, the power of hyperlinks was being curbed. Its biggest enemy was a philosophy that combined two of the most dominant, and most overrated, values of our times: novelty and popularity, reflected by the real world dominance of young celebrities. That philosophy is the Stream. The Stream now dominates the way people receive information on the web. Fewer users are directly checking dedicated webpages, instead getting fed by a never-ending flow of information that\u2019s picked for them by complex \u2013and secretive\u200a\u2014\u200aalgorithms. The Stream means you don\u2019t need to open so many websites any more. You don\u2019t need numerous tabs. You don\u2019t even need a web browser. You open Twitter or Facebook on your smartphone and dive deep in. The mountain has come to you. Algorithms have picked everything for you. According to what you or your friends have read or seen before, they predict what you might like to see. It feels great not to waste time in finding interesting things on so many websites. But are we missing something here? What are we exchanging for efficiency? In many apps, the votes we cast\u200a\u2014\u200athe likes, the plusses, the stars, the hearts\u200a\u2014\u200aare actually more related to cute avatars and celebrity status than to the substance of what\u2019s posted. A most brilliant paragraph by some ordinary-looking person can be left outside the Stream, while the silly ramblings of a celebrity gain instant Internet presence. And not only do the algorithms behind the Stream equate newness and popularity with importance, they also tend to show us more of what we\u2019ve already liked. These services carefully scan our behaviour and delicately tailor our news feeds with posts, pictures and videos that they think we would most likely want to see. Popularity is not wrong in and of itself, but it has its own perils. In a free-market economy, low-quality goods with the wrong prices are doomed to failure. Nobody gets upset when a quiet Brooklyn cafe with bad lattes and rude servers goes out of business. But opinions are not the same as material goods or services. They won\u2019t disappear if they are unpopular or even bad. In fact, history has proven that most big ideas (and many bad ones) have been quite unpopular for a long time, and their marginal status has only strengthened them. Minority views are radicalized when they can\u2019t be expressed and recognized. Today the Stream is digital media\u2019s dominant form of organizing information. It\u2019s in every social network and mobile application. Since I gained my freedom, everywhere I turn I see the Stream. I guess it won\u2019t be too long before we see news websites organize their entire content based on the same principles. The prominence of the Stream today doesn\u2019t just make vast chunks of the Internet biased against quality\u200a\u2014\u200ait also means a deep betrayal to the diversity that the world wide web had originally envisioned. There\u2019s no question to me that the diversity of themes and opinions is less online today than it was in the past. New, different, and challenging ideas get suppressed by today\u2019s social networks because their ranking strategies prioritize the popular and habitual. (No wonder why Apple is hiring human editors for its news app.) But diversity is being reduced in other ways, and for other purposes. Some of it is visual. Yes, it is true that all my posts on Twitter and Facebook look something similar to a personal blog: They are collected in reverse-chronological order, on a specific webpage, with direct web addresses to each post. But I have very little control over how it looks like; I can\u2019t personalize it much. My page must follow a uniform look which the designers of the social network decide for me. The centralization of information also worries me because it makes it easier for things to disappear. After my arrest, my hosting service closed my account, because I wasn\u2019t able to pay its monthly fee. But at least I had a backup of all my posts in a database on my own web server. (Most blogging platforms used to enable you to transfer your posts and archives to your own web space, whereas now most platforms don\u2019t let you so.) Even if I didn\u2019t, the Internet archive might keep a copy. But what if my account on Facebook or Twitter is shut down for any reason? Those services themselves may not die any time soon, but it would be not too difficult to imagine a day many American services shut down accounts of anyone who is from Iran, as a result of the current regime of sanctions. If that happened, I might be able to download my posts in some of them, and let\u2019s assume the backup can be easily imported into another platform. But what about the unique web address for my social network profile? Would I be able to claim it back later, after somebody else has possessed it? Domain names switch hands, too, but managing the process is easier and more clear\u2014 especially since there is a financial relationship between you and the seller which makes it less prone to sudden and untransparent decisions. But the scariest outcome of the centralization of information in the age of social networks is something else: It is making us all much less powerful in relation to governments and corporations. Surveillance is increasingly imposed on civilized lives, and it just gets worse as time goes by. The only way to stay outside of this vast apparatus of surveillance might be to go into a cave and sleep, even if you can\u2019t make it 300 years. Being watched is something we all eventually have to get used to and live with and, sadly, it has nothing to do with the country of our residence. Ironically enough, states that cooperate with Facebook and Twitter know much more about their citizens than those, like Iran, where the state has a tight grip on the Internet but does not have legal access to social media companies. What is more frightening than being merely watched, though, is being controlled. When Facebook can know us better than our parents with only 150 likes, and better than our spouses with 300 likes, the world appears quite predictable, both for governments and for businesses. And predictability means control. Middle-class Iranians, like most people in the world, are obsessed with new trends. Utility or quality of things usually comes second to their trendiness. In early 2000s writing blogs made you cool and trendy, then around 2008 Facebook came in and then Twitter. Since 2014 the hype is all about Instagram, and no one knows what is next. But the more I think about these changes, the more I realize that even all my concerns might have been misdirected. Perhaps I am worried about the wrong thing. Maybe it\u2019s not the death of the hyperlink, or the centralization, exactly. Maybe it\u2019s that text itself is disappearing. After all, the first visitors to the web spent their time online reading web magazines. Then came blogs, then Facebook, then Twitter. Now it\u2019s Facebook videos and Instagram and SnapChat that most people spend their time on. There\u2019s less and less text to read on social networks, and more and more video to watch, more and more images to look at. Are we witnessing a decline of reading on the web in favor of watching and listening? Is this trend driven by people\u2019s changing cultural habits, or is it that people are following the new laws of social networking? I don\u2019t know\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s for researchers to find out\u200a\u2014\u200abut it feels like it\u2019s reviving old cultural wars. After all, the web started out by imitating books and for many years, it was heavily dominated by text, by hypertext. Search engines put huge value on these things, and entire companies\u200a\u2014\u200aentire monopolies\u200a\u2014\u200awere built off the back of them. But as the number of image scanners and digital photos and video cameras grows exponentially, this seems to be changing. Search tools are starting to add advanced image recognition algorithms; advertising money is flowing there. But the Stream, mobile applications, and moving images: They all show a departure from a books-internet toward a television-internet. We seem to have gone from a non-linear mode of communication\u200a\u2014\u200anodes and networks and links\u200a\u2014\u200atoward a linear one, with centralization and hierarchies. The web was not envisioned as a form of television when it was invented. But, like it or not, it is rapidly resembling TV: linear, passive, programmed and inward-looking. When I log on to Facebook, my personal television starts. All I need to do is to scroll: New profile pictures by friends, short bits of opinion on current affairs, links to new stories with short captions, advertising, and of course self-playing videos. I occasionally click on like or share button, read peoples\u2019 comments or leave one, or open an article. But I remain inside Facebook, and it continues to broadcast what I might like. This is not the web I knew when I went to jail. This is not the future of the web. This future is television. Sometimes I think maybe I\u2019m becoming too strict as I age. Maybe this is all a natural evolution of a technology. But I can\u2019t close my eyes to what\u2019s happening: A loss of intellectual power and diversity, and on the great potentials it could have for our troubled time. In the past, the web was powerful and serious enough to land me in jail. Today it feels like little more than entertainment. So much that even Iran doesn\u2019t take some\u200a\u2014\u200aInstagram, for instance\u200a\u2014\u200aserious enough to block. I miss when people took time to be exposed to different opinions, and bothered to read more than a paragraph or 140 characters. I miss the days when I could write something on my own blog, publish on my own domain, without taking an equal time to promote it on numerous social networks; when nobody cared about likes and reshares. That\u2019s the web I remember before jail. That\u2019s the web we have to save.

I jumped into a quick shower, thinking of everything that was going to happen today. \u201cThomas, this is your coffee.\u201d She put the mug on my outdoor desk while I finished to get ready. I went outside, enjoyed the warmth of the sun, already high in the sky. People love to say it\u2019s often cloudy in Ubud, but for now, it\u2019s as blue as the ocean. 27\u00b0C, not bad for a February. Before I can start writing for 30 minutes as I do every morning (even before writing an article on Medium), it seems like I have some things to solve with the villa. I greet my temporary housemate, Florian Tep, who will stay in the Hustlers Villa for the next month. We have a new housemate coming in this afternoon, a Lithuanian girl who needs to focus 1 month in the relaxing environment of Ubud to focus on creating and growing her business. I spend some time with my assistant to fix a few little things with the organisation inside the villa:- make a specific scheduled task list for our cleaning staff- preparation of the first Hustlers Meeting for the next Saturday- other little boring tasks related to handling a villa properly Those are things I am learning by doing. No one ever taught me how to handle a villa for people who will live with you from 1 week to 1 month (that\u2019s the concept of the Hustlers Villa), managing the staff, the cleaning of the garden, the trash collecting, etc. It\u2019s Bali here, and I mostly try to deal with everything using my current skills in Indonesian language. When those skills are not enough, or when what I have to manage is too specific, my assistant handle it. Anyway, the room for our new housemate is ready, what needed to be fixed is fixed, and I finally have time to sit down and write, drinking my coffee. I sit down by the pool, and spend a good 15 min day dreaming (one of my favourite activity). As I\u2019m letting my thoughts coming, going and mixing togethers, one of the most important lessons I have learned in the past years suddenly come back in my mind. I often question myself and what I do. The past 2 years taught me how to silence my ego and focus on what matters, in order to make the right decisions. I became very OK with making mistakes or going in the wrong direction. It\u2019s actually the best way to know where NOT to go or what NOT to do. That\u2019s why I often take time to rethink my choices and adjust the shot when it\u2019s required. And as great as I feel with what I do and all of my choices, I sometimes tend to forget how there is something even more important that what I do. It\u2019s who I become while I do it. I think I am a decent human being. By this I mean that my presence on Earth is bringing at least slightly more good than bad outcomes. And if I were to die tomorrow, I think I could say that even if I could have done way better, I contributed at a very small scale to spread something positive to the rest of the World. This is who I became while building my own way from nothing to something. From traveling on a bicycle without money to reaching 6 figures savings, the main thing people can see is the financial outcome. But here what matters is what people can\u2019t see. Did I achieve it by taking advantage of other people, or did I achieve it by trying to give back 10x to the community? Do I use my money to party and get laid every week-end, or do I use it to learn more and invest in myself? Of course, it\u2019s not black or white.\u00a0Those are examples. But asking yourself the question of who you become while doing what you are doing right now is a very powerful tool to show you what matters. Focusing on who you become is a long shot. And there is no one clapping their hands to congratulate you, as it\u2019s a 99% invisible process. However, when you realise that you are doing you, and that you become yourself a bit more every single day, the gratification and joy you feel are some of the most intense there is.

The name of the publication\u2014a good and smart website I generally enjoy\u2014doesn\u2019t matter for our purposes here, because the interaction I intend to describe is not unique to this specific outlet, nor is it uncommon in the broader world of media. I was asked, via email, to write about a small news story out of New Hampshire that had begun making waves nationally. A police commissioner in Wolfeboro, a tiny town of about 6,000 people, was overheard in a restaurant calling President Obama a \u201cfucking nigger.\u201d Despite townspeople demanding his resignation, the commissioner remained steadfast, writing in an email to his colleagues, \u201cI believe I did use the \u2018N\u2019 word in reference to the current occupant of the Whitehouse [sic]. For this, I do not apologize\u2014he meets and exceeds my criteria for such.\u201d I read the short Associated Press rundown and thought about how the handful of black residents in Wolfeboro must feel knowing that one of their elected officials casually\u2014proudly, even\u2014throws around the word \u201cnigger.\u201d I felt bad for those people and the other people in Wolfeboro, some of whom probably didn\u2019t know they were voting an unrepentant bigot into office when they cast their ballots for the police commissioner\u2019s board in March. I guess I\u2019d also begun to feel bad for America as a whole. Then I closed the AP site\u2019s tab and declined to write about the bureaucrat in New Hampshire who had called the president a racial slur. When beginning any career, it\u2019s important to highlight the experiences and skills you bring to the table that others can\u2019t. For some marginalized writers, that means being direct about the fact that your personal perspective as a woman or homosexual or African American\u2014or all three\u2014will occasionally be perceived as refreshing in an industry so dominated by straight white men. Some of these writers will set up shop at publications specifically tailored to women or gays or blacks or Jews, as I have done in the past. Others might work at generalist publications while making sure to give special attention to issues pertaining to their minority group, as I have also done. In traditional news terms, this is a \u201cbeat.\u201d For several years, I made my unofficial beat the stories, struggles, and politics of blacks in America. I wrote about other things, also, but never with the same frequency or interest. I was pretty good at it, and, more than that, I enjoyed it. Eventually, people began to assume that I\u2019d comment when a particular kind of news story bubbled up\u2014generally one about something bad happening to a black person\u2014and I often times would. I wasn\u2019t surprised when a website I liked asked me to write about the case of a white man of little note in New Hampshire calling a hugely powerful black man a \u201cnigger.\u201d But then I realized I didn\u2019t have anything to say. Or maybe it wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t have anything to say. Maybe it was the realization that writing anything would be to listlessly participate in the carousel ride: an inciting incident, 1,000 angry thinkpieces, 1,000 tweeted links, and back to where we started, until next time. Perhaps it was a feeling that writing anything would finally be too redundant to bear, a pursuit of too many sad and obvious words to heap onto so many other nearly identical words written down before, by me, by thousands of others. What\u2019s a person to say when a Wolfeboro police commissioner outs himself as a proud racist? The same thing everyone wrote when, soon after Obama was first inaugurated, another small-time politician sent out a picture of the White House lawn planted with a watermelon patch? The same thing they wrote when Ted Nugent, a Republican guest to last year\u2019s State of the Union address, called President Obama a \u201csubhuman mongrel\u201d? Or the same thing they wrote when a California woman took to her Facebook page in 2012 to call Obama a \u201cnigger\u201d and wish for his assassination. We can go on like this, of course, because in America the racist traumas are widespread. How about the next time a black person is stopped and patted down without cause? How do you write about that humiliation in a way that\u2019s different from what you wrote when Forest Whitaker received the same treatment last year, and a New York City police chief before him, and thousands of other innocent black and Latino men before them? What new column shall the writer write when an unarmed black person is killed for doing nothing but frightening an armed white person? The same thing he wrote when Trayvon Martin was killed? And that\u2019s to say nothing of when Oscar Grant was killed. Or when Ramarley Graham was killed. Or when Timothy Stansbury Jr. was killed. Or when Amadou Diallo was killed. Or when Jordan Davis was killed. Or when Ousmane Zongo was killed. Or when Jonathan Ferrell was killed. Or when Renisha McBride was killed. A defense attorney once told me that the hardest part of his job was that he only saw people at their worst. People came to him only when they were in serious trouble. And when the case was over, he\u2019d usually never hear from them again. He said it made him feel bad about the world, like he presided over a revolving door of misery. I thought about that conversation the day I texted a black writer friend of mine, who writes a significant amount about blacks in America, to compliment him on a piece and chat about the potential deleterious effects of writing a lot about race. \u201cIt\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d he replied. And though it kept him busy \u201cI\u2019d actually love it if people started not being the worst every day.\u201d I used to think that maybe I\u2019d let my anger serve as an engine. But I\u2019ve since discovered that my anger over each new racist incident is now rivaled and augmented by the anger I feel when asked to explain, once more, why black people shouldn\u2019t be brutalized, insulted, and killed. If you\u2019re a person of color, the racism beat is also a professional commitment to defending your right and the right of people like you to be treated with consideration to an audience filled with readers champing at the bit to call you nothing but a nigger playing the race card. The hostility directed at writers who cover minority beats in America is solid proof that those people are doing important work. But that work can be exhausting. It\u2019s exhausting to always be writing and thinking about a new person being racist or sexist or otherwise awful. It\u2019s exhausting to feel compelled on a consistent basis to defend your claim to dignity. It\u2019s exhausting to then watch those defenses drift beyond the reaches of the internet\u2019s short memory, or to coffee tables in dentists\u2019 offices, to be forgotten about until you link to them the next time you need to say essentially the same thing. After a while you may want to respond to every request for a take on the day\u2019s newest racist incident with nothing but a list of corresponding, pre-drafted truths, like a call-center script for talking to bigots. Having written thousands of words about white people who have slurred the president over the past six years, you begin to feel as if the only appropriate way to respond to new cases\u2014the only way you can do it without losing your mind\u2014is with a single line of text reading, \u201cBlack people are normal people deserving of the same respect afforded to anyone else, but they often aren\u2019t given that respect due to the machinations of white supremacy.\u201d Imagine an editor asking a writer to passionately articulate why a drunk driver hitting and killing a boy on a bicycle is wrong and sad. That would never happen, because a drunk driver killing a boy on a bike is a self-evident tragedy. Asking a writer to exert lots of effort to explain why would be a disservice to the dead, as if his right to life were ever in question, as if our moral obligation to not snuff out our fellow citizens via recklessness were something in need of an eloquent plea. When another unarmed black teenager is gunned down, there is something that hurts about having to put fingers to keyboard in an attempt to illuminate why another black life taken is a catastrophe, even if that murdered person had a criminal record or a history of smoking marijuana, even if that murdered person wasn\u2019t a millionaire or college student. There is something that hurts when thinking about the possibility of being \u201caccidentally\u201d shot on some darkened corner, leaving a writer who never met you the task of asking the world to acknowledge your value posthumously, as it didn\u2019t during your life. I think about race and racism every day of my life. How can any American not? (James Baldwin once proffered the idea that \u201cthe Negro-in-America is increasingly the central problem in American life.\u201d) I anticipate that I\u2019ll always write about race and racism in some professional capacity. Still, wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if writers and creatives on the periphery were welcomed in from anonymity, not thanks to their accounts of woe, but simply because they have things to share\u2014tales of love, joy, happiness, and basic humanity\u2014that have nothing to do with their race and also everything to do with their race. I\u2019m ready for people in positions of power at magazines and newspapers and movie studios to recalibrate their understanding of what it means to talk about race in the first place. If America would like to express that it truly values and appreciates the voices of its minorities, it will listen to all their stories, not just the ones reacting to its shortcomings and brutality. If this doesn\u2019t eventually happen, I wonder how many more writers of color will come to the conclusion, as my colleague did, that this life we\u2019ve made for ourselves is unsustainable. How many essays can go up before fatigue becomes anger becomes insanity? How many op-ed columns before you can feel the gruesomeness of trying to defend another dead black kid slowly hollowing you out? How many different ways can you find to say that you\u2019re a human being? The Wolfeboro, New Hampshire police commissioner who called President Obama a \u201cnigger\u201d ultimately resigned. Less than a month later, two videos went viral within hours of each other. In one, a white woman in a western New York parking lot calls a black man a \u201cnasty fucking nigger\u201d in front of her two children. In the other, a young Justin Bieber uses the word \u201cnigger\u201d over and over in a joke song performed for the delight of some friends off-camera. That video came on the heels of another clip released only days earlier in which Bieber tells this joke: \u201cWhy are black people afraid of chainsaws?\u201d He then mimics the noise of a chainsaw by saying \u201cRun\u2026nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger.\u201d If you\u2019re black and your beat is to offer your thoughts and opinions on the degradation of black Americans, you\u2019ll never want for steady work. A steady mind is not guaranteed. Follow us on Twitter Like us on Facebook Subscribe to our newsletter By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. I now have two great habits I\u2019ve kept up for 5 years: writing and exercising. Try them for yourself. They will get you through if the self-discipline isn\u2019t coming naturally. When you need to do something you aren\u2019t looking forward to, don\u2019t focus on what you have to do, focus on how you want to feel. My absolute favorite minute of the week is 10:01am Saturday. That\u2019s the minute I finish my workout. Do I love 9:01 when I lace on my shoes and get on the treadmill? Nope! How about 9:29 when I have to do abs. Heck no! But I LOVE 10:01, when I have the gym behind me and have the whole weekend ahead of me. To build a new habit, don\u2019t ask \u201cdo I like doing that task\u201d only ask, \u201cdid I do it?\u201d I learned this trick when I took up running. Hard core runners kept asking me \u201cdo you love it?\u201d or more commonly, \u201cdon\u2019t you LOVE it!?\u201d My answer then (and today) is \u201cNO, I DON\u2019T LOVE IT, IT\u2019S HARD, IT HURTS, I GET SWEATY! WHAT\u2019S WITH YOU RUNNING PEOPLE!!!\u201d Now I only allow the question \u201cdid I run this week?\u201d Then I can enthusiastically and proud answer, YES! As humans, it\u2019s pretty easy for us to pair a response to a stimulus. Smart phone designers have turned us into virtual automatons mindlessly responding to our phones buzzing, flashing, or vibrating. Why not prime your brain to do something more useful by creating a pairing between a common stimulus and your desired response? For me, I needed to create stimuli that triggered me to write. I spend a lot of time on planes, so I\u2019ve trained myself that the minute I hear the \u201cbing\u201d of the seatbelt sign going out, I pull out my laptop and start to write. This approach turns activities into habits. I\u2019m like Pavolv\u2019s dog (thankfully I write at the sound of the bell rather than starting to drool)! I don\u2019t ask whether I\u2019m \u201cfeeling it,\u201d I just go on autopilot. This work for me with the gym too. There\u2019s a song I reserve only for the walk to the gym. I love the song and the moment it comes on, my body naturally wants to move. I just have to point it in the direction of the treadmill and off I go. It\u2019s amazing how the sensory connection hardwires habits into our brains. Most of the time, my calendar is used to let other people get what they need from me. Now I use my calendar to schedule time for when I need me. I\u2019m a slave to my phone, so if it says I\u2019m supposed to be writing, I\u2019m writing. When my daughters\u2019 dance competitions overwrite my normal Saturday workout, I immediately reschedule a new gym appointment somewhere else in the week. When my life as an author and speaker heated up a few years ago, my boss paid for 6 sessions with a professional organization coach. One of the best techniques she taught me was to time crappy tasks. Anything I don\u2019t want to do becomes the lightening round of a game show. I set a timer for the 30 minutes and off I go. I use the timer trick at the gym too. If I\u2019m having a low-energy day, I allow myself to do 30 minutes instead of 45. I even have a special, high-energy 30-minute playlist for those occasions. Then I see just how far I can go. Three years ago, I couldn\u2019t run a quarter mile without stopping and I procrastinated each time I had something to write. But now exercise and writing are just part of my routine. My track record isn\u2019t 100%, but it\u2019s probably over 90. I feel good because I know I can count on myself. Or at least I can count on my calendar. I can count on the seatbelt sign. I can count on how I\u2019ll feel when I\u2019m done. And that\u2019s just as good. I hope you\u2019ll try some of these tips to create positive habits for you.

Every time I checked my phone, I was notified about dozens of new tweets like these directed at me. The nicer ones called me a hypocrite; the vicious ones called me a \u201cracist chink.\u201d The harassment, most of which took place on Twitter, started at 11 p.m. on Thanksgiving and continued for nearly a week. The aggressors had been going after a friend of mine\u200a\u2014\u200aa female sports writer\u200a\u2014\u200afor criticizing the name of Washington\u2019s professional football team. When she stopped engaging with them, the harassers moved onto anyone that she had replied to that day. When the early trolls came, I handled them the same way I did for every one-off asshole I\u2019d ever experienced on Twitter. I made a joke and I blocked the account. But this time they kept coming. I made another joke about white privilege, my friend replied to it, and suddenly there were hundreds of tweets showing up in our mentions, saying an assortment of hateful things. They didn\u2019t stop over the course of that weekend. I stopped blocking people because there were too many people to block. The harasser then began to tweet at my work and the publications I write for. They tweeted at my boss. Racist tweets grew from the hundreds to the thousands. The same happened for my friend, only more so. For every tweet I got, she received three more, all managing to somehow be more vitriolic, more furious. Compared with the kinds of threats I received, hers were far more horrifying. And of course they were: She is a woman and a person of color. A friend reminded me of a quote from Louis C.K.: \u201cMen are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them.\u201d I looked up this quote later. Louis C.K. never said it. Margaret Atwood did. Throughout the weekend, I kept trying to empathize with my aggressors. It seemed like the adult way to think about it, but there was also something self-serving about it. I wanted to believe that people couldn\u2019t hate me irrationally, that they must be motivated by something greater. I took a sample of my harassers, and unsurprisingly, most of the abuse came from white men. It\u2019s difficult to determine much other than that, since many of them didn\u2019t have a web presence. (Most of them had fewer than 10 followers, which leads me to suspect a majority of the tweets were coming from dummy accounts. Or perhaps sadder: men with fewer than 10 friends in the world.) You can also tell by whom they choose to harass: mostly women, and men only in the cases when they aren\u2019t white. Of the people who listed locations, they were predominantly from the Midwest, some from the South. The Twitter bios largely declared some kind of political affiliation, such as #Libertarian, #Conservative, #TeaParty (what is with these people and hashtags?). Many were #Gamers; some were even bold enough to declare themselves members of the Klan. In a twisted way, I understood where the white supremacists were coming from. Of course they don\u2019t want to hear a person of color talk about white privilege. They don\u2019t want to hear people of color talk about anything. What the hell else is everyone else so angry about? Then there were the dick tweets. So many of them. These harassers were obsessed with my penis, evoking a stereotype that Asian men have shorter penises than white men. It is a silly thing to be preoccupied about, but the more I thought about it, the sadder I felt for my harassers. It revealed a deep insecurity about their masculinity, a reactionary version of what it means to be \u201ca man\u201d in the U.S. Some of them are just teen boys who are naive and impressionable in the way boys can be. More insidious, and more dangerous, are the older men who feel disenfranchised and threatened by a world that is becoming more accepting of equality for women and people of color. These are men who are angry because they feel powerless. Anonymous harassment is the only way they can feel some semblance of it. Harassment has always been an issue with Twitter, even from its foundation. But over the past year, we\u2019ve seen the ability for this kind of angry coercion to organize with a new determination and speed. Gamergate is the prime example of just how far it can go, and it appears that harassers of different sorts and motivations have learned how to target and mobilize attacks on individuals on subreddits and message boards. Earlier this week, Twitter announced it was working on tools to prevent harassment. A story on The Verge dug a little deeper and asked what that really meant. Not much, it turns out. Here\u2019s a new feature: \u201cIf 100 users all flag the same tweet, it could receive an expedited response.\u201d Apparently it takes 100 people to agree that something is harassment, and only then will Twitter maybe look into the situation more quickly, if they look into it at all. These aren\u2019t tools to prevent harassment. They are features to help you deal with being harassed. On one hand, Twitter is acknowledging that its platform has a harassment problem; on the other, it concedes that there\u2019s nothing they can do about it. A friend created a tool that allows you to block someone and all of their followers. In theory, this is effective when more prominent harassers mobilize their followers against someone. In practice, it\u2019s just as effective as it sounds. On the third day of harassment, I ran the Python script on one user, blocking a total of 6,000 people. The number of racist replies I received dropped from 20+ every hour to barely one every few. Twitter would never release anything like this. The truth is that it is antithetical to Twitter\u2019s business motives to even allow blocking or prevent harassment in the first place. The more you tweet, the better. The more people you follow, the better. Anything that walls off portions of Twitter\u200a\u2014\u200aeven to create safer spaces\u200a\u2014\u200agoes against the company\u2019s ability to monetize advertising. Choire Sicha put it best: \u201cTwitter as a product and as a human experience is broken, pointless and unsalvageable.\u201d The spring of my senior year in high school, I received a weekly prank call to my cell phone. The prankster had some software or device that masked his voice, making it sound squeal-y and high-pitched. He would talk about personal things from my life\u200a\u2014\u200aspecific enough that it was clearly someone I knew, but non-specific enough that it could really be anyone from my high school class. He told me that I was a \u201csexless faggot\u201d who \u201ccouldn\u2019t have sex with a woman\u201d because of my \u201ctiny Asian dick\u201d and that the only way I\u2019d lose my virginity is if I was \u201craped in the ass.\u201d I always let these messages go straight to voicemail. I never told anyone about them because what was the point? There was no way to catch this person, and plus, I had no evidence. I deleted the voicemails after I listened to them. I felt compelled to listen to them, and yet couldn\u2019t bring myself to save them to my phone. Eventually the calls stopped coming. I imagined the harasser wanted a response, a reaction, anything. I wasn\u2019t going to give him that pleasure. That, in a way, was its own quiet victory. I can\u2019t help thinking this is why harassment keeps happening. At a certain point, as an individual, you get fed up with it. You ignore the attacks, and the harasser gets bored. Then he moves onto someone else.

Strip away a person\u2019s smile and you\u2019ll find a grotesque, writhing animal-thing. Human instincts have to be controlled, and religions have often been guides for containing the demons. Sigmund Freud held a similar view: Psychotherapy was his method of making the unconscious conscious, helping people restrain their bestial desires and accord with the moral laws of civilization. In the middle of the 20th century, an alternative school of thought appeared. It was popularized by Carl Rogers, an influential psychotherapist at the University of Chicago, and it reversed the presumption of original sin. Rogers argued that people are innately decent. Children, he believed, should be raised in an environment of \u201cunconditional positive regard\u201d. They should be liberated from the inhibitions and restraints that prevented them from attaining their full potential. It was a characteristically American idea\u2014perhaps even the American idea. Underneath it all, people are good, and to get the best out of themselves, they just need to be free. Economic change gave Rogers\u2019s theory traction. It was the 1950s, and a nation of workmen was turning into a nation of salesmen. To make good in life, interpersonal sunniness was becoming essential. Meanwhile, rising divorce rates and the surge of women into the workplace were triggering anxieties about the lives of children born into the baby boom. Parents wanted to counteract the stresses of modern family life, and boosting their children\u2019s self-esteem seemed like the solution. By the early 1960s, wild thinkers in California were pushing Rogers\u2019s idea even further. The \u201chuman potential movement\u201d argued that most people were using just 10 percent of their intellectual capacity. It leaned on the work of Abraham Maslow, who studied exceptional people such as Albert Einstein and Eleanor Roosevelt and said there were five human needs, the most important of which was self-actualization\u2014the realization of one\u2019s maximum potential. Number two on the list was esteem. At the close of the decade, the idea that self-esteem was the key to psychological riches finally exploded. The trigger was Nathaniel Branden, a handsome Canadian psychotherapist who had moved to Los Angeles as a disciple of the philosopher Ayn Rand. One of Rand\u2019s big ideas was that moral good would arise when humans ruthlessly pursued their own self-interest. She and Branden began a tortuous love affair, and her theories had an intense impact on the young psychotherapist. In The Psychology of Self-Esteem, published in 1969, Branden argued that self-esteem \u201chas profound effects on a man\u2019s thinking processes, emotions, desires, values and goals. It is the single most significant key to his behavior.\u201d It was an international bestseller, and it propelled the self-esteem movement out of the counterculture and into the mainstream. The year that Branden published his book, a sixteen-year-old in Euclid, Ohio named Roy Baumeister was grappling with his own self-esteem problem: his Dad. Roy\u2019s father, Rudy, was a middle manager at Standard Oil. He\u2019d emigrated from Germany a few years earlier, after serving with Hitler\u2019s army on the eastern front, where he\u2019d spent several months in a Russian POW camp. Rudy dressed plainly: colored button-down shirts, khaki trousers, and a military-style buzz cut. He was quick to anger, and strict on discipline with his two children. \u201cHe was very right-wing,\u201d says his daughter, Susan. \u201cHe was a control freak. It was always his way, always needing to be the leader and call all the shots. He had a very big ego. From an early age, he was raised to be looked up to. He was the firstborn, he was the son, he was the one. He always had to be the one.\u201d Hiding from all this in an upstairs room at the back of the house was Roy: fair-haired, blue-eyed, well-mannered. He was often frightened by his father, but he was smart as well. He would become a distinguished psychologist, and a broad, controversial thinker. In the process, Roy would challenge his father. He would also, perhaps unknowingly, adopt his father\u2019s contrary nature, his instinct for an outsider position. That\u2019s one explanation, at least, for how Roy helped bring the self-esteem movement crashing down. IN THE YEARS AFTER BRANDEN\u2019S BOOK, the importance of boosting self-esteem became increasingly entrenched in American life. One of the high points occurred in 1986, when Californian legislators created the State Task Force to Promote Self-Esteem and Personal and Social Responsibility. This was a project born perfectly into its time and place. Its purpose was to discover how self-esteem is \u201cnurtured, harmed, rehabilitated\u201d and to understand its relationship to social problems. After three years of review, the task force\u2019s final report became one of the foundational works of the self-esteem movement. It concluded that: The task force\u2019s conclusion followed a review of the scientific literature that looked at real-world outcomes of high self-esteem. The evidence was limited, but the task force would not contemplate criticism. Leader John Vasconcellos, a California assemblyman, dismissed doubters as people who \u201conly live in their heads,\u201d insisting that \u201cwe all know in our gut that it\u2019s true.\u201d He was right. Thousands and thousands of Americans just knew it in their guts. The idea of self-esteem as a social panacea was too good to question. It spread through the country and much of the Western world. Heads big and small were systematically stuffed full of their own wondrousness. As the 1980s became the 1990s, schools and kindergartens began boosting self-esteem in classes, encouraging children to write letters to themselves, telling themselves how special they are. Five-year-olds in a Texas nursery were made to wear T-shirts that said \u2018I\u2019m loveable and capable\u2019 and to recite the mantra daily. High school awards were dropped by the thousands, and grades were inflated to protect the esteem of low achievers. (One teacher argued, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s grade inflation. It\u2019s grade encouragement.\u201d) Meanwhile, in the courts, judges offered self-esteem boosts to drug dealers, sex workers, and people who wrote bad checks. Court appearances were rewarded with key rings; those who completed periods of drug-free living were given doughnuts. \u201cWe try to build self-esteem,\u201d explained one judge. \u201cI\u2019m talking in terms of treatment, love, and care.\u201d The movement crossed political divides: Barbara Bush told interviewers that \u201cself-esteem has everything to do with how well all human beings live and work,\u201d while Bill Clinton praised the California task force\u2019s report as a \u201cremarkable document.\u201d When Whitney Houston sang that \u201cthe greatest love\u201d was loving yourself, nobody thought that was strange at all. THE WINDOWS IN ROY\u2019S CHILDHOOD HOME looked out over the branches of beautiful oaks, and the shelves on his light blue walls held the books that gave him an escape. He\u2019d wander through the stories of King Arthur and spend hours poring over his prized encyclopedia, delighting his sister with trivia from presidential campaigns all the way back to George Washington. At school he was first in his class, but he carried a painful feeling that he was missing out on all the fun. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t believe that kids should do sports,\u201d he says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t think we should go to dances or parties. It was pretty much just come home and do the chores and schoolwork.\u201d The pressure to succeed was vast. \u201cWe had to be the best in everything,\u201d says Susan. \u201cThe tallest, the blondest, the smartest, the most good-looking.\u201d Because Roy found school easy, his parents had him skip the fifth grade. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for a boy to be a year younger than everyone else,\u201d says Roy. \u201cI grew up feeling like a small person.\u201d One of Roy\u2019s early preoccupations was religion. He read the Bible from cover to cover, trying to find important answers about life and its secrets, but it left him wanting. And, as the years passed, the questions inside Roy began to press against the walls of his smart, colonial-style family house. \u201cAs a child, you believe what your parents tell you,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a very strict message about \u2018this is what life is and what you have to believe in, and anyone who disagrees is an idiot or evil person\u2019. They made their views seem compelling and plausible. But I started realizing some of the stuff they taught me wasn\u2019t right.\u201d He went on to study mathematics at Princeton, where the cracks grew and merged. During a foreign study program at the University of Heidelberg, he took up philosophy and started reading Freud. \u201cI wanted to understand what people are like, why we\u2019re here and what we\u2019re doing. It was a revelation: Freud was approaching the question of where our ideas of right and wrong come from.\u201d Here, it seemed, was a superior method for revealing the secret rules of human operation. But when Roy asked his father if he could transfer to psychology, his father dismissed the idea. \u201cYou\u2019ll be wasting your brain,\u201d he said. It was only when he discovered that Standard Oil\u2019s staff psychologists were paid more than he was that he permitted his son to switch tracks. As Roy\u2019s education continued\u2014Princeton, Duke, Berkeley\u2014he would get together with his sister and try to solve the riddle of their domineering and egocentric father. \u201cRoy\u2019s way to cope is to analyze,\u201d says Susan. \u201cWe would try and talk through what he\u2019d been learning\u2014\u2018Well, maybe he\u2019s doing this because he\u2019s feeling this.\u2019\u201d Roy came to believe his father\u2019s experience in the war, which he entered aged just 17, was formative. \u201cIt made him tough. Kind of bitter. Ruined his teenage years. For a lot of people, those years are a chance to develop your social skills. They didn\u2019t develop very well.\u201d But the war hadn\u2019t just changed people: It also changed the world. The USA started to become an alien place to men like Rudy, and as the power of the human potential movement grew, the older generation was being left on the outside. When Nathaniel Branden\u2019s blockbuster book brought the idea of beneficial high self-esteem to the public, Roy Baumeister was at university. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear much about Branden in academia; he was more out there in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cBut he was really a leader of the self-esteem movement with that book. I was sympathetic to the idea, but I remember being disappointed. He would tell a lot of stories. It was fun to read. But I was looking for science.\u201d To fill in the gaps, Baumeister started studying the differences between people who think highly of themselves and their glum counterparts. His interest was partly pragmatic: Self-esteem was a hot topic, and a great subject for a young academic beginning his career. His undergraduate thesis explored how people respond to public challenges to their self-esteem. \u201cI was looking at how high- and low-self-esteem people react differently to a situation,\u201d he says. \u201cHow they relate to others, how they react to failure, how long they keep going when things are difficult versus giving up, whether they\u2019d rather protect themselves with an excuse or go all out to chase success.\u201d Baumeister remembers reacting angrily to one sociologist who challenged the impact of positive regard. Just like everyone else, Roy Baumeister was a believer. THINGS STARTED TO CHANGE IN 1984, when Roy was preparing to drive across America with a young psychologist named Dianne Tice. \u201cShe had long red hair and a quick wit,\u201d he remembers. \u201cShe was a very thoughtful, disciplined person.\u201d Roy was 31, six foot two, and fresh from the implosion of his first marriage. Dianne, too, was bruised by a recent breakup. \u201cWe\u2019d known each other as somebody else\u2019s partner for a couple of years,\u201d says Roy. But by the time it came for them to climb into his Honda Accord for their drive out west, \u201cour partners had just sort of disappeared.\u201d It was a 2,500 mile trip across a continent, 18 hours on the road at a time for five days straight. \u201cYou can\u2019t go five days with someone in a small car without either hating them or falling in love,\u201d says Dianne. In California, they lived across the San Francisco Bay from each other and would go away on weekend trips. \u201cWe went to Big Sur and I almost got swept into a waterfall,\u201d says Dianne. \u201cA rogue wave knocked me off my feet. There was a bad riptide that would\u2019ve sucked me down very far. But Roy grabbed me. He saved me. I said right then, \u2018I owe you my life.\u2019\u201d Dianne and Roy became partners in love and science. \u201cWe did a lot of that early self-esteem work together,\u201d she says, \u201clooking at what made high-self-esteem and low-self-esteem people tick. At the time, he was totally in favor of high-self-esteem.\u201d But his assumption that high-self-esteem was an unparalleled good, she thinks, was never going to hold. The reasons go back to that smart, sad house near the banks of Lake Erie, during years of the Civil Rights movement, where Roy had weathered the powerful opinions of his out-of-time father. \u201cHis parents always encouraged him very strongly to challenge the authority of popular culture,\u201d she says. \u201c\u2018If everybody\u2019s doing it, it\u2019s probably wrong\u2019. So he\u2019s always been one to challenge the status quo.\u201d Even deeper than this, she believes, is a pent-up need to revolt against the assumptions. \u201cHe was not allowed to challenge his parents at all, so he built up a reservoir of wanting to do that. If you believe in Freud, it\u2019s a Freudian fixation. He always wants to look at embedded views and see \u2018could they possibly be wrong?\u2019\u201d AS THE IDEA OF SELF-ESTEEM AS A SOCIAL VACCINE spread from California to other parts of America and elsewhere, Baumeister was pricked with doubts. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a specific moment,\u201d he says, \u201cthere was just a growing sense of skepticism. I started noticing they were making awfully extravagant claims, like they could balance the state\u2019s budget because people with high self-esteem earn more money and pay taxes.\u201d He read the California state report and its argument, and wasn\u2019t impressed. \u201cThe data was quite weak. I thought, \u2018If that\u2019s the best case, then it\u2019s not that strong.\u2019\u201d It was then that his critical break with the movement came. \u201cEverybody said low self-esteem was a big cause of violence because people with low self-esteem were aggressive,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I knew from my lab work that they\u2019re actually shy and unsure of themselves. They don\u2019t want to take chances or stand out. They do what other people tell them. None of that sounds like they\u2019re going to be aggressive.\u201d Intrigued by the apparent contradiction, Baumeister attempted to chase down the source of the idea that people who hit out do so because, deep down inside, they feel bad about themselves. \u201cEverybody who said it cited somebody else, so I\u2019d look up the previous source, and they\u2019d also cited somebody else. That\u2019s when I realized there was no evidence for it.\u201d He remembers feeling surprised: \u201cIt would be easy to do that experiment. The fact that there was nothing made me suspicious.\u201d He began to wonder; to theorize. \u201cIt\u2019s not thinking badly of yourself that causes aggression. It\u2019s when other people think badly of you. That\u2019s where it all goes horribly wrong.\u201d In 1996 Baumeister, now teaching at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, co-authored a review of the literature that concluded that it was, in fact, \u201cthreatened egotism\u201d that lead to aggression. Evil, he suggested, was often accompanied by high self-esteem. \u201cDangerous people, from playground bullies to warmongering dictators, consist mostly of those who have highly favorable views of themselves,\u201d he wrote. It was an astonishing theory because it ran counter to everything that society and the experts who inform it had been saying for years. It wasn\u2019t low self-esteem that caused violence: It was when self-esteem was artificially high. BAUMEISTER\u2019S PAPER MADE an unhappy man of Nathaniel Branden. The movement\u2019s founding father complained of the \u201cspecious reasoning\u201d in Baumeister\u2019s study, holding it up as an example of \u201cwhat can happen when consciousness and reality are omitted from the investigation.\u201d For Branden, the violent people Baumeister wrote about might have appeared confident, but underneath all that bluster they actually had low self-esteem. \u201cOne does not need to be a trained psychologist to know that some people with low self-esteem strive to compensate for their deficit by boasting, arrogance, and conceited behavior,\u201d he wrote. But Baumeister had more bad news for the self-esteem boosters. In 1999 the American Psychological Society (since renamed the Association for Psychological Science) asked Baumeister to lead a team that would review the literature in its entirety to see, finally, what effect self-esteem had on behaviors such as happiness, health, and interpersonal success. \u201cOur first computer search looking for \u2018self-esteem\u2019 in the abstract came up with 15,000 papers,\u201d Baumeister recalls. \u201cWe had a stack of manuscripts waist-high. Several big boxes-full. We cut it down with strict criteria. We wanted actual data, not just clinical case studies and things like that. We sorted through them, critiqued them, and tried to pull the information together.\u201d A major problem with many of the papers was that they relied on self-reporting. \u201cPeople with high self-esteem just say everything about them is great,\u201d Baumeister says. \u201cIf you give them a questionnaire and ask them about their relationships, they\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh, yeah, my relationships are great!\u201d The team would only accept papers that measured self-esteem objectively. After their cull of the woolly and anecdotal, just 200 or so papers remained. Among the most egregious errors they discovered were those in the papers that focused on academic performance. A correlation had been repeatedly found between high self-esteem and good grades. So, the logic went, if you boosted self-esteem you\u2019d also boost grades. But the authors had made one of the most elementary mistakes in science. \u201cWhen they tracked people over time,\u201d says Baumeister, \u201cthe grades came first, and then the self-esteem. High self-esteem was a result of good grades, not a cause.\u201d Baumeister realized that efforts to boost self-esteem hadn\u2019t improved school performance. Nor did self-esteem help in the successful performance of various tasks. It didn\u2019t make people more likeable in the long term, or increase the quality or duration of their relationships. It didn\u2019t prevent children smoking, taking drugs, or engaging in \u201cearly sex.\u201d His report made the claims of the self-esteem movement look like those of a street-corner wizard. Baumeister and his team did find a few benefits. \u201cHigh self-esteem makes you feel good,\u201d he says. \u201cIt also seems to support initiative.\u201d But as the paper archly observed in its conclusion, \u201cHitler had very high self-esteem and plenty of initiative, too, but those were hardly guarantees of ethical behavior.\u201d Baumeister\u2019s study was published in May 2003. \u201cIt was,\u201d he says, \u201ca shock to a lot of people.\u201d Where does all this leave that confused and pulled-apart thing, the human self? What is the nature of that which lies beneath? Are we that saturnine creature of the Old World, of Freud and Baumeister\u2019s father? A beast that needs to be controlled? Or is there still a chance that the New World can prevail, with its hopeful vision of a pure heart that thirsts only for freedom? IN A 2000 PAPER in the journal Advances in Experimental Psychology, Baumeister and colleagues proposed a new way of thinking about the problem. In their \u201csociometer\u201d theory, self-esteem is a system for monitoring how well we\u2019re doing in our quest for social acceptance. Assaults on our self-esteem trigger a form of pain signal that alerts us to the fact that damage is occurring to the opinions that others hold of us. \u201cSelf-esteem,\u201d they wrote, \u201cis one\u2019s subjective appraisal of how one is faring with regard to being a valuable, viable and sought-after member of the groups and relationships to which one belongs and aspires to belong.\u201d The paper also contained a warning. It compared the pleasure of hollow self-esteem boosting to cocaine abuse. \u201cDrugs take advantage of natural pleasure mechanisms in the human body that exist to register the accomplishment of desirable goals,\u201d they wrote. \u201cA drug such as cocaine may create a euphoric feeling without one\u2019s having to actually experience events that normally bring pleasure, fooling the nervous system into responding as if circumstances were good. In the same way, cognitively inflating one\u2019s self-image is a way of fooling the natural sociometer mechanism into thinking one is a valued relational partner.\u201d We have a word for people who have become high on their own hollow self-esteem: narcissist. The dangers of narcissism became apparent to Baumeister when he tested his theory that people with high self-esteem are largely responsible for violent acts. In one experiment, two people played a game in which the loser is punished with unpleasant barrages of noise. Each player sets the decibel level at which opponents get blasted. Would those with high self-esteem, as Baumeister predicted, turn the sound up to the most aggressive levels? Actually, no. In fact, the effects of self-esteem on aggression appeared to be vanishingly weak. But participants\u2019 levels of narcissism had also been measured. \u201cPeople had just started talking about narcissism, which seems to be the nasty kind of high self-esteem,\u201d he says. \u201cThat had the strong effects. It was people who were high in narcissism who were more provoked and more aggressive than everybody else.\u201d The problem seemed to be that high self-esteem is a mixed category. Some who have it are presumably healthily and accurately confident in themselves. Their sociometers are functioning well. \u201cIf you went up to Einstein and told him he was stupid,\u201d says Baumeister, \u201che\u2019s not going to get mad.\u201d Narcissism, though, is different: It\u2019s the desire to feel you\u2019re superior. \u201cNarcissists believe they deserve to be treated better than other people,\u201d he says. They also lack the moral values of people with genuine high self-esteem. Narcissism, then, is a kind of addiction to self-esteem. So what would happen if you took an entire generation of young people and systematically and repeatedly masturbated their self-esteem mechanisms? Could it be true that the children raised in the school of Rogers, Branden, and Vasconcellos were growing up to be entitled, egomaniacal narcissists? Baumeister has certainly been noticing something like that amongst his students. \u201cThey\u2019re very confident and self-assured, but because of that, they don\u2019t work as hard as they might,\u201d he says. \u201cOther faculties are saying the same thing. Some just cannot take criticism, which is a big problem in academic life. We get criticized endlessly when we submit something. Believing you\u2019re perfect is not a good preparation for that.\u201d The appalling possibility that the self-esteem movement had created a generation of narcissists was picked up by Jean Twenge, one of Baumeister\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. In her 2006 book Generation Me, Twenge laid out astonishing data. For example, by the mid-1990s, the average college male had higher self-esteem than 86 percent of college men in 1968. The figure for women was 71 percent. The average child in the mid-1990s had higher self-esteem than 73 per cent of children in 1979. Back in the 1950s, just over one in ten 14- to 16-year-olds agreed with the statement \u201cI am an important person.\u201d By the late 1980s, that number had risen to 80 per cent, a figure Twenge describes as \u201cincredible.\u201d She argued the surge was linked to concomitant surges in rates of depression and anxiety. \u201cWe fixate on self-esteem and unthinkingly build narcissism,\u201d Twenge wrote. \u201cThis will stay with us even if self-esteem programs end up in the dustbin of history.\u201d Both Baumeister and Twenge have their critics. Some academics take issue with the link between aggression and high self-esteem, arguing instead that factors like shame are more important. The evidence for a narcissism epidemic, too, has suffered an assault: researchers have questioned the methods used to measure narcissism and pointed to studies that don\u2019t support such a rise. More recently, critics have proposed that every generation is \u201cGeneration Me,\u201d and narcissism is just an eternal symptom of youth. Yet Twenge insists she\u2019s supported by the weight of the numbers, observing that there are 22 datasets that show generational increases\u2014and only two that don\u2019t. She also points out that her data compares youngster to youngster, not youngster to middle-aged grump. In 2009, she published The Narcissism Epidemic, a follow-up written with another of Baumeister\u2019s former students, W. Keith Campbell. Twenge claimed that narcissism among Americans was rising at the same rate as obesity, and documented how the mantras of the self-esteem movement had begun infiltrating churches, with God himself being redrawn in our new self-obsessed image. Pastor Joel Osteen, for example, preaches in Lakewood, Houston, at the biggest church in America. \u201cGod didn\u2019t create you to be average,\u201d he tells his congregation. \u201cYou were made to excel.\u201d But this is not the world that the progenitors of the self-esteem movement thought they were making. For them, positive self-regard was a state that had to be earned. \u201cNathaniel Branden meant something a little more honestly come by,\u201d says Campbell, the co-author of The Narcissism Epidemic. \u201cWhen people talked about self-actualization, that meant really pushing yourself to reach your full potential. Self-actualization is really hard.\u201d The reason the empty version of self-esteem proved infectious, Campbell believes, is simple: \u201cIt feels good.\u201d The movement\u2019s U.S. origins are surely no coincidence. Self-esteem fits perfectly over the top of the traditional ideal of the free and noble individual, striving to achieve the American dream. The movement\u2019s sin was making it sound easy. It removed the part about striving, replacing it with an unearned assumption of exceptionalism. The lesson became that simply wanting it is enough. You\u2019re special. You deserve it. \u201cMy kids have to do tasks at school where they talk about why they\u2019re special,\u201d says Campbell. \u201cI mean, you know, they\u2019re not! They\u2019re kids! It\u2019s a curse in a lot of ways. It\u2019s such a crazy idea.\u201d THE ESCAPE THAT ROY BAUMEISTER BEGAN in his room in Ohio may have continued through the decades, but the influence of his father seems to still be in close pursuit. Like Rudy, a man out of time, Baumeister is frequently on the outside, railing at the errors of those on the in. As a man of science, he insists his views are influenced only by data; his determination to remain apart from ideology is so strong that he even refuses to vote. \u201cI try not to have political views,\u201d he says. \u201cI try to get rid of all biases. I want to be open to all ideas. Caring just slows me down.\u201d His most brilliant and controversial work has at its center a refusal to engage with simplistic narratives of right and wrong. \u201cI see the world far more in terms of trade-offs than a lot of other people,\u201d he says. \u201cGood actions are often tied to bad actions. People do things that are corrupt. They take money out of the system. But it\u2019s usually towards supporting their families and relatives.\u201d For example, he has addressed the \u201cmyth of pure evil,\u201d observing that most people who commit terrible acts, even mass murder, do so in the sincere conviction that they\u2019re on the side of the angels. \u201cI wanted to understand how ordinary people got caught up in doing these things,\u201d he says. \u201cI came to realize that those who come to do evil don\u2019t view it as evil. Evil is in the mind of the perceiver. Most of the Nazis thought they were doing noble work.\u201d The feted University of Chicago neuroscientist John Cacioppo is among those who disagree with some of Baumeister\u2019s interpretations\u2014but he recognizes his dedication to thinking the unthinkable. \u201cToo many people just follow others and Roy doesn\u2019t do that. I give him a lot of credit for that. I\u2019m a more conservative, rigorous scientist than he is. He\u2019ll say a lot of things I\u2019d be hesitant to say until I had a lot more data. That\u2019s not meant to be a negative statement about Roy. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s bad. It\u2019s just different. I see a real role for people who have less rigor. It\u2019s antithetical to me personally, but I want to give him kudos for what he\u2019s done. He\u2019s been fearless in a lot of things.\u201d Dianne Tice, his wife, says that this disregard for conventional thinking is not without incident: \u201cSometimes I have to keep him quiet because the things he wants to say are not always politically correct.\u201d Take, for example, Baumeister\u2019s 2010 book Is There Anything Good About Men?. It built upon the idea that culture changes our biology and behavior. \u201cI wanted a case study on how culture influences a broad class of people,\u201d he says. He chose the human male. Rejecting the feminist notion of patriarchy as a conspiracy theory, he presented differences in gender roles as a trade-off. Within human culture, men both win and lose. The mistake of many modern feminists, he writes, is that they \u201clook only at the top of society and draw conclusions about society as a whole. Yes, there are mostly men at the top. But if you look at the bottom, really at the bottom, you\u2019ll find mostly men there, too.\u201d His examples: The homeless; the imprisoned; the people who die at work, 92 percent of whom are male. The popular modern view is that it\u2019s women who are most poorly valued by culture. But, ever the contrarian, Baumeister says men are demonstrably \u201cmore expendable than women.\u201d \u201cAfter he wrote that book, people didn\u2019t believe that he used to be a feminist,\u201d says Tice. \u201cBut he was, much more even than I was. And I think he\u2019s right that society doesn\u2019t place much value on men. What really opened my eyes is the work on battered men. We know that men and women hit each other in about equal amounts. It\u2019s just men are more dangerous because they\u2019re bigger.\u201d She was, however, concerned about the book\u2019s ramifications. \u201cI was worried it might hurt him if he wanted to apply for other jobs or grants. He might be negatively evaluated as a result of people seeing him as sexist.\u201d And did anything like that happen? \u201cOne never knows.\u201d Political correctness upsets Roy Baumeister. He rages against what he sees as a left-wing bias in social psychology that means that white prejudice against the black community is studied frequently, while inter-minority racism is comparatively ignored. Papers that show greed might be in any way good are rejected. \u201cIf you have a finding that says the conservative viewpoint did better, nobody wants to publish it,\u201d he says. Does the breath of Baumeister\u2019s father still tickle the back of his neck? After all, here\u2019s the dictator\u2019s son railing against political correctness; here he is seeking to understand how ordinary people become evil; defenestrating modern feminism; agitating for the representation of right-wing views in academia. Baumeister\u2019s opinions may well come shielded by data, but what are the wounds that guide his analysis? Does Roy fear becoming Rudy? Is he attempting to correct for that possibility by trusting only the methods of science? Does he find, in his psychology journals, the proximity to humanity\u2019s true nature that his parents, and the Letters of St. Paul, failed to provide? When I ask him if he\u2019s undergone a drift rightwards since his student days, there\u2019s a long silence. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that. In America there\u2019s a third movement, the libertarians, who are trying to reduce government involvement and promote freedom. To me, they make a lot of sense.\u201d Once again Baumeister is assuming the pose of heretic\u2014but it\u2019s impossible to avoid the observation that the song he sings is one the political right knows by heart. He\u2019s frustrated by left\u2019s compulsion to look outside individuals for the causes of their problem, be it poverty or addiction. \u201cI sometimes feel like our job is to make excuses for people,\u201d he says. I mention that the \u201csense\u201d of libertarianism is an ideology that\u2014like the self-esteem movement he rejected\u2014was highly influenced by another thinker who believed in the power of the will: Rand. \u201cI\u2019ve never read her stuff,\u201d he says with a shrug. NOW 63, BAUMEISTER HAS TRAVELLED FAR from that room in Euclid. Today, as Francis Eppes Professor of Psychology at Florida State University, he\u2019s received the Association for Psychological Science\u2019s highest honor, the William James Award, and written or edited over 30 books on subjects as diverse as free will, masochism, and the meaning of life. His parents, meanwhile, are still alive and married. Susan says her father\u2014who once scoffed at psychology\u2014is proud of his son. \u201cThe fact that Roy got a Ph.D. and then became number one in his field, he loves that.\u201d But pride isn\u2019t love. Susan remembers hearing about a theory that the most successful people in life are those who are still searching for their parents\u2019 unconditional regard. \u201cI don\u2019t know that my father actually had the capacity to love,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s probably a lot of what\u2019s behind Roy.\u201d Through his work, Baumeister has attempted not only to understand his father, but to escape him and the powerful influence of his ideas. Instead of political ideology, he adopts the methods and disciplines of science. But isn\u2019t it true that all scientists, no matter what their intelligence or learning, believe their data is the best? Nobody is free from the unconscious pulls of instinct and bias. No matter how much we might resist it, we\u2019re all political in the end. Perhaps Roy Baumeister\u2019s greatest victory in his flight from Rudy is his refusal to view the world through the narrow prism of right and wrong. The truth, as he has learned, is that life is never so simple. There\u2019s always a trade-off. From certain upstairs windows in the house where Baumeister grew up, you could catch tantalizing glimpses of Lake Erie. His father loved sailing and swimming, but would never buy a property on the lakefront. It would be a poor investment, he argued. And what if a great storm blew in off the water? There was no control down there by the lake. It was safer where they were. When Baumeister moved back to Cleveland in 1991, he recalled his father\u2019s warnings as he looked for a new place to live. They made sense. But it was a trade-off. You could avoid the risks of being by the water, or you could experience the simple joy of waking up and seeing the lake spread out in front of you. Roy and Dianne signed the purchase papers on Christmas Eve. Their new house was right on the shore.

Not the fun kind of travelling where you end up in some hot, sunny location to have a nice relaxing time, but the more necessary type that ends up with you in an office. This has meant numerous hours on trains. And in stations. And in cars. And walking from the station to the car and so on. One thing has really struck me; how much time this all takes and how easily this time can be wasted. I mean, I could just download some series from Netflix and mentally switch off. Just sit, zombie like staring at my laptop screen. That would be easy, that is what most people do. I\u2019ve seen them. But instead, I actually find the train one of the most productive places I have ever worked. Part of it is the fact that you cannot be easily disturbed. You can put your phone on silent and immerse yourself in a piece of work. For me, I just plug in some ambient music, fire up Asana (workflow app) and start knocking things off my \u2018to-do\u2019 list. It\u2019s probably the most focused time I have in the whole week. 3.5 hours of productivity, each way! It hit me earlier that much of our business is being built on the GWR service between London St Pancras and Plymouth! J Don\u2019t get me wrong, the Wi-Fi is usually slow but it\u2019s free and fast enough to send emails and access files online, and that\u2019s in cattle class too. Asana is a particularly useful tool and a great little productivity hack that I cannot recommend highly enough (other workflow apps are available but this one is by far the best). It allows you to breakdown projects into tasks and subtasks and allocate them to specific members of your team. This can all be sync\u2019d to your local calendar and even the communication app, Slack. For us it\u2019s been a revelation. I can sit in a cab or be walking to a meeting and be on Asana, updating my task lists as new thoughts pop into my head. This really enables you to keep your head clear and have the ability to focus on one thing at a time. Audiobooks are my next recommendation and something that I personally love. Stick them on double speed and apps like Audible can provide vast amounts of entertainment and education when you\u2019re on your feet and on the go. There is a wealth of business, investing and personal development audiobooks out there, as well as podcasts, which you can use to leverage your \u2018dead\u2019 time and reap genuine benefits in return. My recommendations for both are below. Audiobooks: Podcast: And there are loads more. Just have a search in the charts on the podcast app and have a listen! In the interest of balance, I must also advise against all of this if you happen to be travelling with a companion who wants your attention (e.g. your partner!) or indeed if you really need the rest. The examples I give above don\u2019t have to be restricted to your \u2018dead\u2019 time and if you need to take 60 minutes out, you\u2019ll probably be more productive the next day by taking the time to recharge. So, in summary, don\u2019t waste your time when travelling or moving from A to B. Be productive, listen, learn and adjust. Also, get some Airpods, they really help!

Like many nowadays, the article primarily had elements to enrage a reader about the tech world. While that is sufficient for media outlets to drive their ad and book sales, it does little for actual minorities in tech. In fact, it is very detrimental. The narrative that depicts the tech industry as completely toxic with stereotypical anti-social white men as the villains running it robs minorities of many great role models whose paths could propel them to success as well. The kid in this picture, Bill Gates, looks nothing like me. But his ingenuity and early vision to put a computer on every desk is something I could always relate to. From seeing where his journey took him, I knew a path I could follow too. That\u2019s why I was building software, getting A.I patents as a teenager and now have my platform, Market Sensei, used everyday in 100+ countries. Ultimately, Bill Gates and many other previous great tech entrepreneurs do not look like me but they don\u2019t have to. So, what follows is my honest take. One cannot add new ingredients to a pot by simply stirring the pot. Similarly, one cannot add more or new color to a pot by simply stirring it either. If there are not enough minorities (women, people of color e.t.c) in tech then how does stirring and agitating the pot contribute to having more minorities included? It does not. It just creates a turbulent environment for both the new minorities looking to enter tech and the minorities already in tech. In this era, for the media, controversy and outrage gets more clicks than a well researched and objective piece about the good work an unknown minority entrepreneurs or tech professionals do with startups. And, for news sites along with book sellers clicks and ad clicks, are equivalent to the sound of a cash register. Is choosing to portray the tech industry as a sexist, racist and prejudice filled industry the best way to get more women, people of color and other underrepresented groups to rush to join? Personally, I want more underrepresented groups rushing to the tech industry because building products that impact millions and create jobs is one of the most fulfilling things one can do. But, because the reward is so fulfilling, even in an ideal world, it is a very demanding journey for anyone regardless of their background. As someone who has been a member of the tech community for their entire adult life, I\u2019ve seen and experienced both its very good and the very bad. Where possible, I\u2019ve tried to ensure I help the good triumph over the bad. Perhaps because of the people I choose to surround myself with, I know far more well-intentioned people in tech, and far more people tackling challenging problems with their startups for social good than people allegedly organizing \u201ccuddle puddles\u201d to guide their startup investments. And, what I do know is that, more often than not, the good people in tech are overlooked and not supported by the same media outlets eager to incite outrage towards the tech industry they cover. There are numerous examples of great tech entrepreneurs and tech minds that paid the price for good work they stood for with their lives as the media shunned & ridiculed them. There is a reason the public reads more news about lavishly funded startups than other startups regardless of how well other startups performs. It is not because more lavishly funded startups provide more value to consumers or society. In fact, a major piece of the outrage the media is trying to place against the tech industry is around the fact that too many lavishly funded startups do not solve significant problems for society. But money gets attention, and for the media that claims to bring social consciousness to the tech industry: money is king and queen. But, true change can only come when the tech media really examines their own toxic coverage culture that puts all values and moral consciousness aside for their love of all things money. As a member of the tech industry that is overlooked by the same media now monetizing outrage about matters affecting underrepresented people in tech, this is how it looks: Many underrepresented people in tech as well as \u2018traditionally represented\u2019 members have been in the office working hard on these issues since 6:00AM, you\u2019re waiting for 9:15AM and not with real actions towards resolving issues but with a pep talk of no or negative value. Action speaks louder than words Most startups start with a family and friend funding round. So for anyone who truly cares about having more traditionally underrepresented entrepreneurs, then be friends with more of them and\u00a0,when push comes to shove, support them and contribute to their family and friend funding round to get them going. Lastly, for any tech entrepreneur, the most successful company they can build is one where their customers are their most willing and best investors. Customers are your most willing investors when they love your products and spend time enjoying and in some way paying for your products. Customers are the best investors because they don\u2019t demand equity when they buy into your products and vision. When you have that, it doesn\u2019t matter how many angel investors or venture capitalists turn you down because your business won\u2019t even need them.

The tool is simple and give users inspiration to challenges that can improve their social life and confidence. It\u2019s the user who decides what he/she wants to do, and also the user who are doing all the hard work. To update and improve our products, we do design sprints, originally invented by Google. It\u2019s five days where the team defines a problem to solve, build and test a solution. Below I\u2019ll walk you through each day, based on an example from our last sprint. One should think that deciding on a key problem to solve in a specific area is easy? Even obvious? But try to gather people from your company from different backgrounds and ask them; \u201cwhy are we not selling more?\u201d You\u2019d probably get as many problem-definitions as people in the room. Monday is the day to agree on what problem to solve. And the bigger the problem the better. We then interview experts to understand the problem from different angles. A senior UX\u2019er from the running app Endomondo was among these on Monday, giving input on what makes people continue to run AND use the same app for tracking? By Tuesday the Sprint team are presenting solutions from other organisations who have similar problems. How do fitness apps make users exercise? How does Duolingo makes people continue practice on a language? After presenting several ideas, and writing down new ones based on the input, it\u2019s time to get into drawing mode. Everone makes simple drawings of a process flow, or a specific situations related to the problem. Different inspirational methods are used to get the team to deliver some great ideas, but no one shares their work.. just yet.. On Wednesday each team member puts their best drawings in a pile and someone hangs them on the wall. Without knowing who has created which, a voting process starts. Soon different areas of the drawings are filled with little dots from other team member, who particularly liked that part of a flow. Without any presentations or discussions, it becomes clear where the good stuff is. If you don\u2019t think you can cover everything related to the problem from Monday, decide what part of the process to focus on. A final detailed solution is drawn, based on the ideas generated by the team. And that\u2019s the end of Wednesday. Our final solution; Give people personal rewards, in the form of tips, depending on who the user is and how they use the product. And now we build it. No matter what idea we come up with Wednesday, if it is a psysical or digital product or an experience, we only have Thursday to build it. The product we build doesn\u2019t have to be real, it just have to appear real enough to get users genuine response. Technical skills are rarely needed, a bit of creativity and you\u2019ll see even the most crazy idea turn into a testable product by the end of the day. In our case, instead of cooding the analytics to give users personal rewards, another team member was simply just observing what the users typed and acted as the bot, and gave users inputs that look personalised to them. The solution is not scalable at all but perfect for collecting insights. Friday is testing day, so make sure you have invited 5 (potential) users to come and test the product, one at the time. For our test, the user only needed to go through the prototype flow one time, for us to see their reactions, which we depended on, as we did not have a \u201cback\u201d option in the prototype. Our testers tried to go back in the product, to pick other challenges, and clearly stating that they wanted to work on them also, to get new rewards. It wasn\u2019t technically possible, but it looked like it was, and it was the clearest evidence, that they wanted to continue using the product, to get more rewards. We also saw that all of the testers had difficulties understanding where they should pick a goal to work on. We never considered it to be hard to understand, but now we have the oppertunity to fix it, before building real, time consuming features. \u2014 I hope you got some inspiration!\u00a0:) For more about us at Steps, visit: www.stepsapp.xyz By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

For a show that claims to be about nothing, it has certainly managed to fill up nine seasons worth of content, all with seemingly no plot. The show, if you\u2019re unfamiliar with it, traces the day-to-day lives of (mainly) 4 quite unremarkable people\u200a\u2014\u200aJerry Seinfeld, George Costanza, Cosmo Kramer and Elaine Benes. These 4, along with plenty of other side characters and guest stars engage in what seems to be a series of meaningless conversations and activities, which somehow all come together towards the end of the duration of each episode. Yesterday while animatedly watching one of the episodes in which Frank Costanza talks about the a festival he had created, \u201cFestivus\u201d, I found myself thinking how much I adored Frank Costanza as a character. But he hadn\u2019t featured in many episodes right? Neither had Jackie Chiles, the versatile lawyer, and yet he\u2019d had the same effect as had Frank. Which episodes were those again? Damn. You\u2019d thinking having watched this show so many times, such information would be \u201ctattooed in my brain\u201d. But admittedly, it was not. And there Had to be a more complicated, yet fun way to get this information than looking it up on Wikipedia. And thus, the weekend data-dive game was on. The measure used in this analysis is the number of times a person has a line to speak per episode. So it follows that the first time a person (say Jackie Chiles) had a line throughout the show would be the first time he/she was featured. Other results that followed were how important a character was to the show or an episode, or in how many episodes was say, Elaine or Kramer, not present. Also, we know the central 4 characters, but how do the 3 characters apart from Jerry rank against each other? So, this is how I went about it. Scraping and parsing the data. I obtained the list of episodes and scraped every episode\u2019s script off of seinfeldscripts.com <Hat-tip> using Requests at a consistent rate so as to not overwhelm them, even if it was just around 200 automated API calls. This website also has the listing of all episodes with the episode numbers from 1\u2013180 alongside it.[1] The data scraped was neither very manageable nor consistent in the form obtained. So a pattern was slightly troublesome to derive, but finally I found a way to just get the dialogues and more importantly, the person who delivered them using Beautiful Soup (bs4). In case it was a well written script, the pattern would be something like - And the above mentioned code snippet would handle. But in many of the files you had entries like And the only indication here that a dialogue has begun is the colon (\u201c:\u201d). So this was the other case to handle. Storing and filtering the data Looping through the entire set of scripts resulted in a dictionary of dictionaries, where the key was an episode number and the value was a dictionary of the cast for that episode with their corresponding counts of dialogues. Next I consider the characters I\u2019m primarily interested in, since for this usecase, I don\u2019t really care about some people like Sue Ellen Mischke or Stan the Caddy. After translating the keys of the dictionary obtained in Step 3 to uniformly be in upper case, I store the occurrence values per episode for the characters mentioned above along with the total number of dialogues per episode (\u201cTOTAL\u201d) in a dataframe since Pandas is a very good tool to manipulate data.The occurrence values were then normalized to be in percentages of the TOTAL. Despite all the attempts to obtain complete data, there were some files i.e. episode scripts that were able to be only partially processed or were unable to be processed because there was no way to distinguish beyond a shadow of the doubt between the character names and the dialogues themselves. This was obviously because the only source considered was Seinfeldscripts.com. A future experiment will probably consider other sources to fill in the missing data. To this end, I\u2019ve filtered out entries that had a TOTAL value < 100 The finale episodes have also been omitted from this analysis. Results: The main result was a set of graphs based on the following criteria I chose -a) % of dialogues per episode of Elaine vs Kramerb) % of dialogues per episode of Elaine vs Georgec) % of dialogues per episode of George vs Kramerd) Episodes in which Frank Costanza featured\u00a0e) Episodes in which Susan featuredf) Episodes in which Jackie Chiles featuredg) Episodes in which Newman featured Other miscellaneous graphs were also computed. The X-axis for all graphs shows the episode number (albeit unclear) and the Y-axis tracks the % occupied per episode. Understandably, Jerry has the largest number of dialogues in every episode. a) Elaine vs George\u00a0: The trend shows that George (~20\u201330%) always has more screen space than Elaine(~5\u201325%)\u00a0. b) Elaine vs Kramer\u00a0: While they seem to be uniformly matched for the most part, it looks like Elaine almost always has more to say than Kramer, atleast for the first 60% of the total number of episodes. Towards the end however, Kramer seems to be having more to say. c) George vs Kramer: No surprises here. George dominates with ~20\u201330% of the conversations while Kramer averages out at close to 15% of the conversations. So, we see that in terms of main character importance, Jerry > George > (Elaine = Kramer). Moving on, d) Frank Costanza: Frank Costanza first appears in episode 62\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cThe Handicap Spot\u201d and finally in episode 166\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cThe Strike\u201d (the legendary Festivus episode) barring the finale episodes. e) Susan Ross Susan first appears in episode 43\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cThe Pitch\u201d and finally in episode 134\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cThe Invitations\u201d, when\u2026 you know.. f) Jackie Chiles Jackie Chiles plays a major role in only 3 episodes Episodes 113, 122 and 143, again barring the Finale. I finally have my answer\u00a0:D g) Newman We see that Newman plays a key role in more episodes than any of the other side characters, going upto 14% in episode 132\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Bottle Deposits\u200a\u2014\u200apart 2 where he runs a bottle scam with Kramer (Aah nostalgia). This experiment was a lot of fun. I hope to fill in the blanks in the next ones and also work out stats and relationships for the other characters. SERENITY NOW!!!!

As a teen, I felt like there was a psychic barrier, an invisible wall of emotional glass, that kept me from cultivating friendships, from ever feeling like I belonged. For a long time, I blamed this on others. Later, I learned the truth\u200a\u2014\u200athe wall was of my own making; the loneliness, my own reward. For me, empathy has always been a skill rather than a talent. What I\u2019ve learned, I\u2019ve learned from practice\u200a\u2014\u200aand part of that practice has always involved books. One interesting read that explores empathy is Leslie Jamison\u2019s essay collection, The Empathy Exams: Essays, which debuted at #11 on the New York Times bestseller list. To understand what empathy is and how to cultivate it, it helps to first understand what it is not. In one essay, Jamison writes of her time as a medical actor, where she would pretended to be be sick patient in front of medical students. For 15 minutes, students would talk to Jamison and try to extract medical information from her. Afterwards, she would grade their performance. The first part of her evaluation graded how much information the students got from her. The second part graded how well they did it: Why is it so important to voice empathy? Why is it not enough to simply stand around, believing strongly that you care? With experience, I think I understand a little bit about why. Three months into my first serious relationship, my girlfriend at the time said, \u201cI love you.\u201d I couldn\u2019t say it back to her. I just couldn\u2019t. So I played it off with a joke. She got angry. Weeks later, she asked me why I wouldn\u2019t say the words to her. \u201cIt\u2019s too early,\u201d I said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even been together a year.\u201d She got even angrier. Even later, she asked again. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you just say you love me?\u201d she said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to say it,\u201d I replied, annoyed. \u201cCan\u2019t you see how I feel from my actions? Isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d In retrospect, that was a bad idea. We\u2019re all insecure about something. Hell, I\u2019m insecure about many things. To have someone voice that they care, is entirely different from having to, on faith, believe that they do. But simply voicing, says Jamison, is not always enough. After all, we all say things that we don\u2019t mean. In Japan, the art of fake caring has been polished and packaged into an easy to remember acronym, roughly translated as the \u201csa-shi-su-se-so of flattery.\u201d Women are taught to use certain phrases to please men and potentially score a future husband: Though I bet some guys love it, it\u2019s clear to me how empty conversation filled with such phrases is. It takes more than canned responses to understand, to empathize and (I hope) to win over a man. But many medical students don\u2019t do much better, says Jamison: Empathy is not just about voicing care. Canned sentences are not enough. Empathy is also about voicing care with a degree of finesse: The two keywords here, I think, are \u201cinquiry\u201d and \u201cimagination.\u201d Empathy requires that we understand how people feel in the particular, not in the abstract. To do this, we need to imagine and, to imagine, we need to ask questions. Perhaps we can compare empathy to an archaeological excavation. To extract fossils from the earth (I imagine), you need to do more than beat at the soil with a shovel. You also need complicated machinery, tarp, brushes, dust pans, trowels, wheelbarrows, and, most importantly, interns willing to work for no pay. Jamison prefers to compare empathy to a kind of travel: Each question we ask\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201dWhat\u2019s it like to grow up on a farm?\u201d; \u201cDo you ever get scared to go on stage?\u201d; \u201cI\u2019m terrified by the idea having children. Oh you were too? How do you get over it?\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ais an opportunity to dust away another layer of the abstract, a chance to see another person\u2019s world little more clearly. These two actions: inquiry and imagination are not possible without two qualities of character. One quality we need, argues Jamison, is humility: A few selfies in front of Tokyo Tower or the temples of Kyoto won\u2019t be enough to understand the Japanese people. To understand them, you must be willing to live with them, eat their food, work alongside them. This is one reason, perhaps, why the arrogant end up with few genuine friendships. How can you connect with someone when you think you know everything there is to know? A second quality we need for empathy is bravery. Empathy is always a risk. On one hand, we risk asking the wrong questions and, as a result, hurting or insulting someone. On the other hand, we risk creating a connection, an emotional two-way street we cannot close, that forces us to feel someone else\u2019s pain and suffering. One last quote. I like how Jamison suggests empathy is never something passive, never something that \u201cjust happens\u201d to us. Rather, empathy is a choice: Empathy is a choice, a risk, an effort. It\u2019s up to you to ask, \u201cIs it worth it?\u201d Read the Jamison\u2019s original essay, and many others, in her first essay collection, The Empathy Exams. Did you like that?

Zehbrauskas, who wrote the essay and took the photographs for the New York Times, takes us inside Casa Xochiquetzal, a house in downtown Mexico City that has become a retirement home for prostitutes who no longer make their living on the streets. In the essay, we are simultaneously admitted into the private space of Casa Xochiqutzal and kept at a distance. The women, whose lives have been marked by the most public of professions, confront us head-on and hold us at arm\u2019s length. Public and private collide in the essay and in the lives of the women it profiles. With only one exception, each photograph in the essays offers us one of two distinct frames for viewing the women of Casa Xochiquetzal. Domestic scenes, dominated by the mustard yellow of the Casa\u2019s walls, appear in landscape and highlight our distance from the women in them. We are inside, but we are not let in. The photograph below makes that point most dramatically. Seeing it, we are not even yet allowed inside the house. Just before this photograph appears in the essay, Zehbrauskas notes, \u201cIt is not easy to find the house. It is hidden behind a maze of street vendors. The large wooden doors to the entrance are usually locked. \u2018Visitors are only allowed with a previous appointment made by email,\u2019 says a sign out front.\u201d The photograph duplicates that point and reinforces it. It purports to show us the front door to Casa Xochiquetzal, but only the caption and context let us see it. Shadows, power lines, disintegrating cardboard boxes, and a dark overhang obscure our view. The scene is busy with people, windows, and the stuff of urban life. Though the upper corner of the door is the photograph\u2019s brightest spot, the door is barred by the shadows of three power lines and a nearby wall. We are not welcome. The way is shut. The Latin root for the Spanish word \u201cprostituto/a\u201d and English word \u201cprostitute\u201d invokes availability. It means, roughly, \u201cto offer for public sale.\u201d The women of Casa Xochiquetzal made their living by being available in public. In return, their families and communities shunned them, leaving them to make their way in public even after they stopped being able to make their living through sex work. In that conventional frame, they were public women evicted from private space. Now, in Casa Xochiquetzal, there is a reversal. The domestic scenes\u200a\u2014\u200alike the entryway photograph and the final photograph of the essay\u200a\u2014\u200aenforce privacy and hold viewers at bay. The residents of Casa Xochiquetzal are private women. Unavailable. My initial read of the essay\u2019s last photograph, which features Patricia Robles Orozco alone in her room, was that it isolated her, setting up her present state as pitiable in contrast with her former life as a cabaret star. Ms. Orozco\u2019s slumped posture and bent head certainly corroborate that reading. But I have to catch myself. She is unavailable to me, yes, but that inaccessibility is, itself, an assertion. As Ms. Orozco sits near the window so that light will fall on her work, she is a private subject. She chooses to be no longer available in public. If the domestic scenes emphasize privacy, though, two-thirds of Zehbrauskas\u2019 photographs in the essay take an entirely different tack. These individual portraits, set against a solid black background, put us face to face with the women of Casa Xochiquetzal. They glare at us. Dare us. Challenge us to be publicly available even as they are not. I will confess to loving the portraits and the quotations that accompany them. Raquel L\u00f3pez Moreno dons a blue cap and frowns out of the frame, her chest and belly thrust forward and draped in a plaid scarf. Her hands\u200a\u2014\u200athe wrinkled, age-spotted hands of an 81-year-old\u200a\u2014\u200ahang at her side, but there is no passivity here. \u201cI\u2019m proud. I put my two daughters through school,\u201d she tells us. Damn right she did. Private shame may not disappear; its marks may remain (the fact that Ms. Moreno lives in Casa Xochiquetzal suggests that her daughters may have rejected her), but it is balanced with a distinct sense of public pride. The women of the portraits are not available to us, but demand that we be available to them. Zehbrauskas\u2019 portraits do not romanticize the lives of sex workers or the realities of making yourself available for public sale. In their captions, many of the women echo Norma Ang\u00e9lica S\u00e1nchez Garduza\u2019s assertion, \u201cI never want to go back to the streets. It\u2019s too hard. You lose your dignity as a human being.\u201d Yet the demands they make in these portraits make clear that they, nevertheless, retain their dignity. Ms. Garduza is elegant, austere. Her look activates the familiar tropes of Latina allure, but her gaze short-circuits them. Out in public, on the streets, you lose your dignity and your humanity and become the object of others\u2019 desire. Here, in public again but on different terms, Ms. Garduza makes us the objects of her dignified glare. Adriana Zehbrauskas, Casa Xochiquetzal, and the women in these photographs together trouble the terms of publicity and privacy that are so brutally, poignantly at the center of sex work. Photography inevitably makes its subjects appear available for public consumption\u200a\u2014\u200aat least on some level. The refusal of that availability makes these images unnerving in the best possible way. Reading The Pictures\u00a0, the only site dedicated to the daily review of news and documentary photography.

Tomorrow was going to be the culmination of three years of research and, possibly, a day that would change her life forever. Around four a.m. she popped two Benadryl and managed to drift off. But in just a few hours she had to be up and ready to go. Cheryl and her husband, Dickie, are retired, and live in eastern Virginia, way out on the end of the Northern Neck peninsula, which juts like an arthritic finger into Chesapeake Bay. It\u2019s a beautiful and isolated spot, where most people tack up \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs and stay close to home. The Whittles enjoy their life in the country, but Cheryl was eager that day to make the long drive to meet Effie Jane. She showered, threw on a T-shirt, jeans, and sneakers, dotted make-up on her cheeks, and scrunched a dollop of mousse into her thinning brown hair. There\u2019s nothing showy about Cheryl, not even on a day like this. She\u2019s short and shy, with nine grandchildren and no pretensions. She grabbed a shoulder bag, heavy with the day\u2019s supplies, and kissed Dickie on her way out the door. Her anxiety mounted as she drove her yellow pick-up past sleepy cornfields, old plantations, and cemeteries, up the peninsula and into mainland Virginia. Then she pulled into the tiny parking lot of Panera Bread in Richmond. She didn\u2019t have to wait long before Effie Jane Erhardt found her\u2014that yellow truck was hard to miss. Effie Jane pulled open the truck\u2019s passenger door and announced Cheryl and Effie Jane met on Ancestry.com, a popular website for people trying to fill in their family trees. After several email and phone encounters, each woman felt a kinship that neither had experienced before. Both were born in 1951, and grew up about 20 miles from each other in the Richmond area. They both speak with soft Southern drawls, had traumatic childhoods, are devout Christians, and, as children, felt like outsiders in their own families. Cheryl quickly got down to business, retrieving a small cardboard box from her bag in the back seat. She opened the top, plucked out a fat plastic tube, and handed it to her friend. Effie Jane held the tube under her mouth and spit\u2014and spit, and spit, and spit. She had never realized how much saliva froths and fizzes. She passed the tube back to Cheryl, who snapped on a plastic cap, gently mixed the tube\u2019s contents, and dropped it in a clear plastic bag with an orange BIOHAZARD label. Then the two women went into Panera for lunch. SINCE 2000, when a company called Family Tree DNA sold the first commercially available home testing kit, an estimated one million people have dabbled in genetic genealogy\u2014also known as recreational genetics, extreme genealogy, and even anthrogenealogy. Traditionally, amateur genealogical research was regarded as a niche hobby for older white men, but today it attracts people of all ages, races, and walks of life. The rapid transformation is due to two technological revolutions. Twenty years ago, doing genealogy meant hitting the pavement: traveling to local historical societies, courthouses, libraries, and cemeteries to paw through dusty books and records. Then came the internet, which made the most useful references\u2014census and voter lists, birth certificates, military records, even the archives of local newspapers\u2014accessible from home. Not only that, but genealogists started connecting with each other online, sharing their research and overlapping trees, creating a vast online database that anyone could tap into and, more importantly, add to. In 1997, a company called Infobases, which sold compact disks of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints publications, bought Ancestry Magazine and its website, Ancestry.com, turning the latter into a subscription genealogy service. By 2009, when Ancestry.com went public, it had a near-monopoly on the booming industry. The world of ancestry research has become a perfect example of a highly scalable business based largely on freely provided, user-generated content. Today Ancestry.com has a few competitors, like MyHeritage.com and Brightsolid, but it remains dominant, with almost three million paying subscribers, 12 billion records, and 50 million family trees. Revenues from the company\u2019s ten popular websites and the Family Tree Maker software totaled $400 million in 2011. In late 2012, a European private equity firm bought the company for $1.6 billion. The second transformation came from rapid advances in genetic testing. After Family Tree DNA launched its test, other companies followed: 11 by 2004, and almost 40 by the end of that decade. Today you find celebrities like Meryl Streep and Yo-Yo Ma tracing their lineage on primetime television shows. As the price of commercial genetic tests has plummeted\u2014many now cost just $99\u2014families like the Whittles have been able to join in. Three companies\u201423andMe, Family Tree DNA, and Ancestry.com\u2014have emerged as major players, and each is intent on growing its most valuable asset: a proprietary database of customers\u2019 genetic data. 23andMe has information from more than 400,000 people and counting, and Family Tree DNA has over 650,000 different genetic records. The bigger these databases become, the more useful they are for filling in genealogists\u2019 ever-expanding family trees. But the growth of the databases also raises serious privacy concerns\u2014not only for people who buy the tests, but for close or even distant family members who share some of their DNA. Searching your genetic ancestry can certainly be fun: You can trace the migration patterns of 10,000-year-old ancestors, or discover whether a distant relative ruled a continent or rode on the Mayflower. But the technology can just as easily unearth more private acts\u2014infidelities, sperm donations, adoptions\u2014of more recent generations, including previously unknown behaviors of your grandparents, parents, and even spouses. Family secrets have never been so vulnerable. If you find a relative on a genetic genealogy database\u2014say, a second or third cousin\u2014then with the help of Google, social media, digital obituaries, and other publicly available resources, it\u2019s usually possible to find closer kin. Adoptees have used their newfound genetic knowledge to browse photo albums and look for potential biological relatives on Facebook. Children of sperm donors have found siblings they never knew they had. Couples who used artificial insemination to conceive have discovered that another man\u2019s sperm had been used. And then there are people like Cheryl, who learn to their surprise, late in life, that they aren\u2019t the person they thought they were. Over sandwiches at Panera, Cheryl and Effie Jane exchanged photos and told childhood stories. Taking advantage of the restaurant\u2019s Wi-Fi, Cheryl took out her laptop and logged into the 23andMe website, patiently explaining how the process worked. Cheryl was a veteran. Genetic testing had already shaken up her world, raising startling new questions about where she came from. She was here because she believed that Effie Jane was her sister. She was praying for it. If she was right, the journey she\u2019d been on for the last three years would reach its end. Her mind could rest. The women left the restaurant together, drove to a nearby post office, and sent the sealed package to a lab in Los Angeles. There, technicians would screen Effie Jane\u2019s DNA for about one million genetic markers. Four to six weeks later, 23andMe would send Cheryl an email saying the results were ready. CHERYL\u2019S QUEST BEGAN one afternoon in late 2008, when she and Dickie were sitting in their living room watching Oprah. The episode included a segment about a Silicon Valley start-up called 23andMe that was selling genetic tests directly to consumers. One of the company\u2019s founders, Anne Wojcicki, was nine months pregnant. She told Oprah how her DNA test results and those of her husband\u2014Google co-founder Sergey Brin\u2014offered clues about their unborn child. Cheryl, then a registered nurse, was intrigued. She had married Dickie when she was 14 and he was 20. The pregnancy that spurred their young union resulted in a stillborn girl, born with too much fluid in her brain. After hearing Wojcicki\u2019s story, Cheryl thought that this DNA test might provide a genetic explanation for their daughter\u2019s death. What\u2019s more, she had been interested in genealogy for years, and had done a lot of work on the line of her father, Josiah \u201cJoe\u201d Wilmoth. Perhaps DNA testing would expand that research. Cheryl remembered some of the basics about how genes work from nursing school, and learned more after browsing 23andMe\u2019s website. For instance, most of us have 23 pairs of chromosomes, or long segments of DNA. Both sexes have 22 pairs of so-called \u201cautosomal chromosomes\u201d\u2014each pair includes one copy inherited from each parent. But the 23rd pair, the \u201csex chromosomes,\u201d is different. Men inherit a Y chromosome from their father and an X chromosome from their mother. Women, in contrast, receive an X chromosome from their father and a second X from their mother. To investigate her father\u2019s ancestry, Cheryl decided to look at the DNA of a male in her father\u2019s line. Joe Wilmoth had died in 1989. But his son Milton Wilmoth, Cheryl\u2019s older half-brother, was alive and well. So she called Milton and asked: If she paid for it, would he consider taking a genetic test? Milton didn\u2019t own a computer and had no interest in his DNA, but he readily agreed to help his sister. So, in early 2009, Cheryl bought three kits from 23andMe\u2014one for her, one for her husband Dickie, and one for Milton\u2014at $495 a pop. Two months after that, she was back at her computer poring through the results. From what she could tell, nothing in her genes or Dickie\u2019s gave any clues about why their first baby had died. But not long after she took the test, 23andMe launched Relative Finder, a service that allowed customers to find relatives in the company\u2019s database based on shared segments from all 23 chromosomes. Oddly, Milton\u2019s name did not appear in Cheryl\u2019s list of DNA relatives. She tried signing into 23andMe using Milton\u2019s account instead, and saw that her name did not appear in his list of DNA relatives, either. After a couple of months, Cheryl reached out to CeCe Moore, an expert in genetic genealogy who runs a popular blog on the subject. \u201cI wrote to her and said, \u2018Can you tell me what I\u2019m doing wrong? I can\u2019t get this thing to work.\u2019\u201d Cheryl recalls. CeCe revealed the truth that Cheryl suspected, but had been scared to confront: Milton was not biologically related to her. For Cheryl, there was only one explanation: She was a Wilmoth by name, but not by blood. The notion that Joe wasn\u2019t her biological father didn\u2019t sit well with Cheryl. It meant, after all, that her mother had lied to her\u2014and maybe to Joe and everybody else\u2014for decades. But Cheryl didn\u2019t feel anger toward her mother. In fact, the more she thought about it, the more she felt comforted. Many things about her childhood suddenly made sense. When she was growing up, Joe never gave her much affection or attention. And when he drank, which was often, he could turn mean. \u201cI never felt a part of him,\u201d she says. \u201cI grew up believing in my heart that I did not belong.\u201d The news was a painful shock, however, to Cheryl\u2019s younger sister, Sandi Satterfield, who was crushed at the thought that they weren\u2019t full siblings. Joe had always doted on Sandi, and Sandi had adored him, despite his flaws. Yet she worried about what it might mean for her own roots. Could it possibly be that she, too, wasn\u2019t his? After prodding from Cheryl, Sandi agreed to take a 23andMe test to confirm that Joe was her father. When her results came back, in June 2010, they showed that she was at extremely high risk for colorectal cancer. Just seven months later she was diagnosed with stage IV of the disease. \u201cIf we had known this earlier in her life, she may have been able to take the appropriate actions to prevent this horrible disease,\u201d Cheryl says. But Sandi\u2019s DNA results also resolved her worries about her own lineage. Cheryl and Sandi didn\u2019t share half of her DNA, as full siblings do. They shared around 22 percent, making them half-siblings through their mother. Sandi shared 25 percent of her genome with Milton, which meant they were half-siblings through their father, Joe. Sandi\u2019s first reaction was acceptance. Four days after the results came back, she sent Cheryl an email. But as the information sunk in, Sandi became distressed about the implications of the test. She was hurt when, a few weeks after the results came through, Cheryl sent an email to Sandi and 15 other friends and family with the subject line, \u201cWho is my biological daddy?\u201d In the email, she laid out the whole story of Milton and Sandi\u2019s tests, revealing that Joe wasn\u2019t her biological father and reflecting a bit on her feelings: Two days later, Sandi responded to the email and similar things Cheryl had posted on Facebook. She was upset that Cheryl referred to Joe as Daddy Joe, as opposed to just Daddy. \u201cI know you mean no harm and [are] only trying to distinguish between sperm donor and daddy, but it really bothers me for him,\u201d Sandi wrote. \u201cI just feel so bad for him wondering if he knew and now I feel as though he was played a fool.\u201d \u201cI should never have taken that test,\u201d she added. \u201cI feel so terribly guilty.\u201d BLAINE BETTINGER IS A WELL-KNOWN FIGURE in the genetic genealogy world. The 37-year-old is an intellectual property attorney by day. \u201cBut I joke that it\u2019s just a way that I make money to pay for more genealogy tests,\u201d he says. He has been researching his family history since he was a kid and studied molecular biology and genetics in graduate school, so he was perfectly poised for the genetic genealogy revolution. Bettinger bought his first genetic test in 2003. A few years later he launched a blog\u2014the Genetic Genealogist\u2014with the aim of explaining the science behind the tests in simple language. It now receives around a thousand visitors a day, he says. Genetic genealogy can be extremely complicated, but most cases require only a basic understanding of our 23 pairs of chromosomes. Most chromosomes, you could say, are promiscuous. During the formation of egg and sperm, each chromosome inherited from the mother physically crosses with its counterpart from the father, and as the pieces mingle they freely exchange segments of DNA. This recombination gives our species great genetic diversity, and it\u2019s the primary reason non-twin siblings are never genetically identical. But the Y chromosome is chaste. The vast majority of its 50 million DNA letters do not swap with other chromosomes, passing almost identically from father to son, son to grandson, and so on. That means that when a genetic change spontaneously occurs in a Y chromosome, it can be passed down to male descendants forever, serving as a reliable marker of their paternal lineage. This was famously demonstrated in 1997, when researchers published a study of Jewish priests in the journal Nature. According to Jewish belief, the high priesthood began 3,300 years ago with Aaron, Moses\u2019s older brother, and has been passed from father to son ever since. Today, many Jews have the surname Cohen or Kohen, meaning \u201cpriest\u201d in Hebrew. The researchers scraped a few skin cells from the inside the cheeks of almost two hundred Jewish men from Israel, North America, and England, and compared the mens\u2019 Y-chromosomes. Close to 70 had been told at some point that they were direct descendants of the high priests. And these men, it turns out, had a distinctive Y-chromosome profile. \u201cThe simplest, most straightforward explanation is that these men have the Y chromosome of Aaron,\u201d the lead researcher told the New York Times. The following year, a similar genetic study made headlines when it bolstered the controversial theory that Thomas Jefferson had fathered a child with his slave, Sally Hemings. The researchers looked at the genes of male descendants of Jefferson\u2019s paternal grandfather and found that they carried a combination of 19 genetic markers that is quite rare, showing up in just a tenth of a percent of all men. But the researchers found exactly the same set of markers in a descendant of one of Hemings\u2019s sons, Eston, meaning that Eston\u2019s father was either Jefferson or one of Jefferson\u2019s close male relatives. For genealogy buffs, these studies had thrilling implications. Since the Middle Ages, Western cultures have passed surnames from father to son. In theory, then, men who have the same surname should share markers on their Y chromosomes. This wouldn\u2019t be true for everyone, of course: multiple families may have taken up the same surname even if they weren\u2019t related, and adopted children often take the last name of their adoptive fathers. But it\u2019s true for enough people to be useful for tracing family trees. When Family Tree DNA launched its genetic genealogy test, which screened for 12 markers on the Y chromosome, genealogists could find members of their paternal line not with treks to libraries or cemeteries, but by uploading their DNA results to the company\u2019s database. That was 2000. By the end of 2001, the company\u2019s customers had organized research projects for about a hundred surnames. After 23andMe launched, in 2007, it added thousands of markers associated with health risks, such as those that Cheryl heard about on Oprah. There are also companies that specialize in determining ancestry for African Americans, Native Americans, and other specific ethnicities. For people like Bettinger, DNA testing has made genealogical research richer and more fulfilling. \u201cOnce I got the DNA test back, I was able to look at my family tree in a whole new light,\u201d he says. Bettinger is Caucasian and had assumed that his ethnicity was one hundred percent European. But tests revealed that he carried Native American markers. \u201cThis was a complete shock,\u201d he says. He had known from his previous research some of his ancestors had lived in Honduras in the mid-1800s, but had assumed that they were all English missionaries. After getting his results back, he realized that some of them were native Hondurans, with ancestry from both Honduras and the Cayman Islands. \u201cGenealogy is not only about names, dates, and places, but about filling out the story of each ancestor as well\u2014what their lives were like, what their motivations might have been like, the trials and tribulations and joys that they experienced in their lifetime,\u201d Bettinger says. For some people who do genetic genealogy, though, the information they unearth is more difficult to accept. \u201cYou would not believe the things we can find out,\u201d particularly when genetic information is combined with searches from the internet and social media, says CeCe Moore, the blogger who helped Cheryl. \u201cIf you\u2019re a privacy advocate, it is worrying.\u201d Over the past three years, Moore says she has answered emails from more than ten thousand people interested in using genetic genealogy, and has intensely worked on searches for about a hundred people. Many of these people are adoptees or, like Cheryl, have discovered that they have mystery fathers. \u201cWe used to only have an adoptee get a close match every six months,\u201d says Moore. \u201cNow it\u2019s happening every single week.\u201d \u201cI believe that knowledge is power, and I think we can gain much more than we will lose from this movement,\u201d says Moore. (She is also an unpaid liaison between several genetic testing companies and the genetic genealogy community, and a paid consultant for the popular US television show \u201cFinding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates, Jr.\u201d) At the same time, though, there\u2019s no denying that some of this newfound knowledge will be painful. \u201cA lot of times people find out things that really shake their identity,\u201d she says. AFTER LEARNING THAT JOE WILMOTH WASN\u2019T her biological father, Cheryl began unpacking what she knew about her mother, Vivian. Vivian Tipton was strikingly beautiful, even in her older years, and had an infectious cackle of a laugh. She grew up in Petersburg, Virginia, a small town about 25 miles south of Richmond. In July of 1941, when she was 16, she married an 18-year-old soldier named Richard Thompson. Just five months later he left to fight in Europe. Richard returned after the war, and he and Vivian moved into a house across from her parents. By the end of 1949, the couple had two girls, Toni and JoAnn, and Vivian was pregnant with a third. Vivian always said Richard was the love of her life, but their marriage was cut short on December 21, 1949, when Richard was killed in a dump-truck accident. Vivian was devastated, staying in bed all day and refusing to celebrate Christmas. After having her third daughter, Jayne, in February, Vivian and the girls moved in with her parents. Not long after, she moved out, leaving her children to be raised by their grandparents. The next few years of Vivian\u2019s life are not entirely clear, but sometime in 1950 or 1951 she met Joe Wilmoth. They married in the summer of 1951 and moved to Chester, about 10 miles from Petersburg. They had a rocky relationship, to say the least. Joe was physically abusive at times, and the couple seemed to never stop arguing. Cheryl was born less than seven months after their marriage, on Christmas Eve of 1951, and grew up believing that she had been a premature baby. After the DNA test, though, Cheryl wondered if even that were true. The test raised so many unsettling thoughts, the kind that kept her up at night. How many of the other stories of her early life, she wondered, were fiction? From ages one to four, Cheryl lived with a couple who had grown up with Joe. Cheryl doesn\u2019t know exactly why. It could be because Joe and Vivian weren\u2019t getting along\u2014or, perhaps, because Joe didn\u2019t want to raise another man\u2019s child. The next decade of Cheryl\u2019s life was unstable and traumatic. She lived in more than a dozen different homes in Florida and Virginia, and frequently witnessed violent outbursts from Joe. Looking back, Cheryl suspects that some of Joe\u2019s behavior could be explained by post-traumatic stress disorder\u200a\u2014\u200ahe had seen combat in the Philippines during the war. As a child, though, no explanation would have helped. She was only terrified. Through all of this turmoil, Cheryl tried to protect and care for her little sister, and the girls forged a powerful emotional bond. Still, they were different in more ways than they were alike. Sandi was tall and thin; Cheryl, short and plump. Sandi was happy-go-lucky from a very young age, and by the time she was a young woman, liked to drink, smoke, and party hard. Cheryl was shy, anxious, fearful, and prone to crying. Perhaps their most striking difference, though, is in their relationship with Joe. \u201cTo me, he was everything,\u201d Sandi told me. \u201cShe was afraid of him.\u201d The day after Christmas, 1963, the family moved into a new home. The house was right up the road from Dickie\u2019s family, and soon Cheryl and Dickie were sweethearts. She got pregnant in early 1966, soon after her 14th birthday, and they were married in May, just before Dickie turned 21. Cheryl\u2019s early marriage shows the extent of Joe and Vivian\u2019s parental neglect, Dickie says. \u201cIt was pretty obvious,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, you don\u2019t let your 14-year-old girl go out with somebody as old as I was.\u201d In 1980, when Vivian was just 55, she was diagnosed with lung cancer. Cheryl came over most days to make food and help clean the house. One day, she and Vivian opened up an old cedar chest of Vivian\u2019s personal mementos. The chest contained a pink card issued by the hospital on the day Cheryl was born. It noted, in handwritten script, that she weighed almost seven pounds\u2014much heavier than a baby who was two months premature could possibly be. Vivian was sick for three years, and Cheryl\u2019s relationship with Joe disintegrated over this time. She has a vivid memory of confronting him one day, when he was sitting at his dining room table. \u201cI said to him, \u2018Why do you treat me so different from Sandi? What is it? Am I not your child?\u2019\u201d Joe looked out the window, Cheryl remembers. Then he looked down at his coffee cup and said, \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say that.\u201d DNA TESTS, IF DONE RIGOROUSLY, are far more definitive than tattered forms in old cedar chests, and far more emotionally potent. The genetic genealogy industry had barely gotten off the ground before scientists, sociologists, and ethicists were debating its societal impact\u2014for better and for worse. Early concerns focused on accuracy. All of the tests\u2014whether they look at the Y chromosome, autosomal chromosomes, or other types of DNA\u2014work in essentially the same way. They screen the billions of letters of a person\u2019s DNA for a certain number of markers, and then compare that combination of markers with those found in reference samples taken from thousands of people living in various regions of the world. Test accuracy, then, starts with two things: the number of markers analyzed, and the size and selection of the comparison set of samples. When genetic genealogy debuted, the technology cost many times what it does today. So the first tests screened a relatively small number of markers, leading to a crude measure of ancestry. The first test that Blaine Bettinger bought, from a now-defunct company called DNAPrint Genomics, screened his autosomal chromosomes for just 71 markers, and used those to estimate his ties to four broad ethnic groups: 88 percent \u201cIndo-European,\u201d 12 percent \u201cEast-Asian,\u201d and zero percent \u201cNative-American\u201d and \u201cAfrican.\u201d \u201cThose early autosomal tests were sort of wildly inaccurate,\u201d Bettinger says. The subsequent tests he bought showed that his Honduran ancestors had both Native American and African roots. Today\u2019s genetic tests can probe many more markers, making them much more accurate. 23andMe uses around half a million markers, on all 23 chromosomes, to probe each customer\u2019s ancestry. But many other companies continue to use only a small number of markers, and none make their reference databases or methodology transparent to customers. As one group of scholars wrote in a 2009 paper in Science: \u201cGenetic ancestry tests fall into an unregulated no-man\u2019s land, with little oversight and few industry guidelines to ensure the quality, validity, and interpretation of information sold.\u201d Even if all the tests were completely accurate, they\u2019d still pose big philosophical questions: How much weight do individuals give to genes when forming ethnic, racial, and religious identities? How much weight should they give to DNA? Cheryl, when pressed, acknowledges that she is some combination of her innate genetic predisposition, traumatic upbringing, and six decades of life experience. But like many people, she seems to give special weight to her genes. As she posted to a site called Cousin Connect shortly after finding out that Joe wasn\u2019t her father: \u201cI want nothing from anyone [except] to know what blood line flows through my veins, my children, and grandchildren\u2019s.\u201d Many people find religious and cultural identities in their DNA. Take Andrea, a 35-year-old adoptee. When she was less than two years old, her biological parents put her and two older brothers in foster care. The children were soon adopted, but their new parents were alcoholics, and they had messy and difficult childhoods. At 16, Andrea left home and, a few years later, began searching for her birth parents. She found her father\u2019s profile on a dating website and called him. \u201cThat was a really hard phone call, because he was not interested in me,\u201d she says. He also told her about her biological mother, and some searching revealed that she had died. But Andrea was profoundly uplifted by the results of her DNA test, which she bought from 23andMe about a year ago. The test indicated that she\u2019s approximately one-quarter Ashkenazi Jewish. \u201cThat was like, the shock of all shocks,\u201d she says. Though she is a practicing Christian, she has felt strong ties to Jewish culture since college, where she was a religious studies major. \u201cI was very, very drawn to Jewish studies classes, I took biblical Hebrew, and always wanted to go to Israel,\u201d she says. Finding out that she had genetic roots to Judaism was bittersweet, she says, because she would have liked to have grown up in the Jewish culture. She\u2019s making up for it now by reading all she can about Jewish history. \u201cI will sit at home and watch documentaries on YouTube about Jerusalem,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cI love it. And it\u2019s so fascinating to me\u2014the personal connection I had [with Judaism] even before I knew, and the one that continues now in my life.\u201d That kind of emotional connection, the \u201cA-ha!\u201d moment, is what Cheryl has been searching for all her life. She\u2019s always wondered why she and her children don\u2019t look like her sisters, Vivian, or Joe. Her son, Travis Whittle, has curly hair and a gregarious personality that Cheryl says resembles no one else in the family. She wonders about her own traits and predispositions, too. She has had several bouts of depression over the years, and is almost always anxious. \u201cI know that my mother had some depression. But I wonder if my father might have had some problems, too.\u201d It wasn\u2019t enough to know that Joe wasn\u2019t her father. To feel whole, she had to know who her real father was. \u201cYou know how in the Bible it says, so-and-so begot so-and-so begot so-and-so?\u201d Cheryl says. \u201cIf you leave out a begot, there\u2019s something missing. It doesn\u2019t quite fit.\u201d CHERYL\u2019S FERVENT HUNT FOR the mystery man responsible for half of her genetic identity has consumed much of her time over the past three years. She didn\u2019t have much luck browsing the Relative Finder section of the 23andMe website, which compared her DNA to that of the other people in the company\u2019s database who had opted to share with the community. Her only genetic matches were estimated fourth, fifth, and sixth cousins\u2014nowhere near close enough to trace back to her father. In June of 2010, Cheryl bought Family Tree DNA\u2019s genetic test, \u201cto fish in more ponds,\u201d as she puts it. The $293 cheek-swab test gave her access to all of the people in Family Tree DNA\u2019s database, any one of which could have been a match. Unfortunately, though, she caught no fish. Cheryl\u2019s search went cold for nearly two years before picking up in April 2012, when CeCe Moore put her in touch with Diane Harman-Hoog of Redmond, Washington. Diane has spent her retirement years\u2014\u201c17 hours a day, 7 days a week,\u201d she says\u2014as a genealogy \u201csearch angel,\u201d helping hundreds of people, mostly adoptees, figure out their family mysteries at no charge. Diane had just started to add genetic results into her search methods, and was eager to look into Cheryl\u2019s case. By pooling information from various sites, Diane created a spreadsheet showing more than five hundred people who shared some of Cheryl\u2019s DNA. Each line of the spreadsheet gave the person\u2019s surname and the precise chromosome location where their DNA matched Cheryl\u2019s. But, big as it was, Diane\u2019s spreadsheet didn\u2019t identify any useful leads. \u201cDiane wrote me and said, \u2018Cheryl, we do not have enough. Your matches aren\u2019t close enough yet,\u2019\u201d Cheryl recalls. That was August 2012. Just a few months earlier, Ancestry.com\u2014the largest genealogy company in the world\u2014began selling its first autosomal DNA test. Cheryl bought one in September, for $99, to try her luck in yet another pond. Eight weeks later she had her matches: Nobody was closer than a fourth cousin. During this lull in her search, Cheryl says, she had a profound spiritual experience. \u201cOne morning I got out of bed\u2014and this sounds crazy probably, but, you know, I believe in God. I was just feeling real down about it. But then something inside of me said, \u2018You will find your father.\u2019 And so I was clinging to that. I knew that it\u2019s just a matter of not losing hope.\u201d One February morning this year, Cheryl received a note via Ancestry.com\u2019s internal message service from a woman named Jeannette Morrison, a genealogy hobbyist who had taken the test to expand her tree. She had identified Cheryl as a possible second cousin. Cheryl wrote back immediately, and updated Diane about the new lead. A second cousin match, Cheryl knew, could be a very big deal. While Ancestry.com\u2019s test will estimate the relatedness of two people, it doesn\u2019t allow customers to compare their genetic data chromosome by chromosome. And Cheryl couldn\u2019t tell from Jeannette\u2019s family tree whether they were related through Cheryl\u2019s mother or father. So Cheryl bought another 23andMe kit and sent it to Jeannette\u2019s house in Ohio. When Jeannette\u2019s test results came back, in April, Cheryl discovered that Jeannette did not share any DNA with Sandi. In other words, Jeannette was exactly what Cheryl had been praying for: a solid lead to her biological father. 23andMe showed that Jeannette and Cheryl shared 17 segments of their DNA\u2014including, crucially, two bits of the X chromosome. Through logical inferences and painstaking searches\u2014comparing trees, geographical locations, birth and death dates\u2014Diane found one of Jeannette\u2019s relatives, Joseph Parker, who was about the right age and had lived in the right place to be Cheryl\u2019s biological father. Joseph had died in 1987, leaving behind a son, Joseph Jr., and one daughter, Effie Jane, who lived in Richmond. According to Diane\u2019s analysis, Effie Jane could either be Cheryl\u2019s first cousin once removed or her half-sister. There was only one way to find out. GENETIC GENEALOGY IS PART OF the much broader cultural trend of uploading personal data to the cloud. We willingly flaunt photos, videos, and demographic information on social media\u2014Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, match.com\u2014and give our credit card and social security numbers to banking and retail sites. Even seemingly private data\u2014emails, cell phone records, internet browsing patterns\u2014is actually, we\u2019re learning, under government surveillance. What\u2019s fascinating about genetic genealogy is that it brings together two very different perspectives on privacy. DNA is arguably as personal as it gets. It\u2019s an individual\u2019s unique code of life. That\u2019s why, among doctors and healthcare workers, genetic data is subject to strict privacy regulations. The traditional genealogy community, on the other hand, is all about sharing\u2014sharing family trees, sharing documents, sharing stories. \u201cThe only way you can connect with people is with some loss of privacy,\u201d says Yaniv Erlich, a geneticist at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Erlich is a world expert on genetic privacy. Earlier this year, his team caused a stir among medical researchers with a study in Science showing that supposedly anonymous participants in genetic research studies can be identified using simple software and an internet hook-up. But Erlich is also an avid genealogist. In the past few years he has bought DNA tests from 23andMe and Family Tree DNA, and has chosen to upload his genetic data to their databases. In doing so, he discovered that he carries the Cohen profile on his Y chromosome, confirming what had been passed down through his family\u2019s oral tradition. He also found a fifth cousin whom he later met at a family reunion in Poland. That cousin grew up as a Christian, but because of his genetic discoveries is converting to Judaism. \u201cIt touches people, what they find in their DNA,\u201d Erlich says. \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful.\u201d The core privacy tension in genetic genealogy, Erlich notes, is that your DNA is not yours alone. \u201cBy putting your data out there,\u201d Erlich says, \u201cyou\u2019re not only sacrificing your own privacy but also the privacy of people who are connected to you, because you share DNA.\u201d In June, the Times, a British newspaper, ran a front-page story with the headline, \u201cRevealed: The Indian Ancestry of William.\u201d Two distant cousins of Prince William had their DNA tested with a company called BritainsDNA and discovered that they carried a rare set of markers that had previously been found in only 14 people: 13 Indian and one Nepalese. Because the DNA in question passes only from mother to child, and the cousins shared a great-great-great-great grandmother with William\u2019s mother Diana, they could infer that the heir to the throne also has these Indian roots. That particular bit of trivia is only important if you\u2019re in the business of selling newspapers, as commentator Alex Hern pointed out in the New Statesman. But what if the genetic intel hadn\u2019t been so silly? As Hern put it, \u201cThere is a wider issue at stake here, which is that the story reveals information about the genetic make-up of someone who has not consented to any DNA tests.\u201d The loose definition of genetic privacy, of course, is what allows people like Cheryl to solve their life mysteries. Cheryl\u2019s cousin Jeannette, by agreeing to a DNA test, opened up the possibility of Cheryl identifying her real father and his descendants\u2014regardless of whether any of them wanted segments of their DNA posted on a public database. This risk\u2014that relatives may be harmed in some way by the sharing of their DNA\u2014has led some to argue that the decision to share is not an individual\u2019s to make. In 2010, Henry Louis Gates, Jr. asked 12 celebrities to get DNA tests for his television show about genealogy, Faces of America. The novelist Louise Erdrich was the only one to refuse. Erdrich\u2019s maternal grandfather was a chief of the Turtle Mountain Chippewas, a Native American tribe in North Dakota, and Erdrich is also an enrolled member. As Erdrich explained to Gates regarding the DNA test: Legally, however, genetic testing is an individual decision. And unlike Erdrich, many people only consider privacy repercussions when they\u2019re suddenly facing them. MIKE TAFFE HADN\u2019T GIVEN MUCH THOUGHT to violating his extended family\u2019s privacy when he sent a tube of his spit to 23andMe in early 2012. Taffe is a neuroscientist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, and he was interested in the medical risk markers he might be carrying. As an adoptee, he would also become interested in the company\u2019s Relative Finder service. For Taffe\u2019s first few months on the service, the closest matches were not close: third or fourth cousins. Then a first cousin popped up: an African American man named Chris. Taffe wrote to Chris using 23andMe\u2019s messaging service, explaining that he was looking for his father, who was, according to records from the adoption agency, a Puerto Rican man born in the 1940s. Chris said that didn\u2019t ring any bells, and their correspondence ended soon after. Taffe let it go. Then a year later, the company dropped its prices to $99 per kit, spurring him to send in spit samples of his three children. Back on the site, he was reminded of his message to Chris and started snooping around online. He found Chris\u2019s Facebook page, which was open to public viewing, and clicked through his photos. From these, he spotted Chris\u2019s mother. (They had to be related through her, Taffe reasoned, because 23andMe had shown that they didn\u2019t share Y chromosome DNA.) Then on the Facebook page of his presumed aunt, Taffe found some of her high school photos and her name. After some more judicious Googling, he found an obituary for his aunt\u2019s brother. No other siblings were mentioned. This man, Taffe thought, could very well be his biological father. The obit named the man\u2019s three surviving children, and one of them, Cliff, had a Facebook page. Taffe was immediately struck by Cliff\u2019s photo: They shared a nose. \u201cIt was like, whoa, dude,\u201d Taffe says. Looking through his presumed half-brother\u2019s photos, Taffe saw a few that Cliff had posted of his father around the time of his death. The nose was the same. This summer, Taffe took the plunge and sent a Facebook message to Cliff. It was vague, saying only that he was interested in ancestry and that he thought they might be related. Cliff never responded. If he ever does, Taffe isn\u2019t sure how much more he would disclose. He has started a discussion about these issues on a 23andMe forum targeted at adoptees. \u201cObviously a lot of the adoptees have decided that their right to know trumps any other possible consideration. I do not, at present, agree with this.\u201d The 23andMe community forums, open to any 23andMe customer, are filled with gripping stories of people who are looking for their parents. They\u2019re usually adoptees who bought the 23andMe test for this purpose. But there are also stories of people who inadvertently discovered that their parents weren\u2019t who they said they were. One such story comes from Terry, a college student whose world was rocked by the matches she found on 23andMe. At the top of the list was a man, whom she calls John Doe, who shares 28 percent of his DNA with her. 23andMe suggested that he was her grandfather, but that didn\u2019t make sense given what she knew about her family. Terry sent John Doe a message through 23andMe and learned that he is 23 years old, ruling out the grandfather theory. After hunting around online, she discovered that it\u2019s not only her grandparents who share one-quarter of her DNA; John Doe could also be her uncle, half-brother, or double first cousin. Since she didn\u2019t share any X chromosome pieces with John Doe, she figured he was a half-brother through her father. Terry called her mother and asked her what she made of John Doe. As Terry explained on the forum, after initially seeming baffled her mother tried to deter her from pursuing John Doe. Over the next few days, dozens of other community members chimed in with advice and sympathy. One member asked Terry if she had considered the possibility that her parents had used a sperm donor. She had. Her parents were married for nine years before her birth, she wrote, so it was possible they had had fertility issues. After learning about John Doe, Terry had asked her mother directly if they had used a sperm donor\u200a\u2014\u200aa suggestion her mother described as \u201cinsulting.\u201d Terry believed her mother at first. But doubts crept in, partly because Terry\u2019s ancestry composition did not match her father\u2019s ethnicity. John Doe, for his part, didn\u2019t seem to understand genetics. He told Terry he thought they were cousins, and that it was just a \u201ccoincidence\u201d that they shared so much DNA. Terry gently reminded him that first cousins share 12.5 percent of their DNA, on average\u200a\u2014\u200anot 28 percent. Eventually, Terry\u2019s parents confessed: They had indeed used a sperm donor. Despite the new information, John Doe was in denial, continuing to say that he was definitely his father\u2019s son. Terry\u2019s story illustrates the web of privacy concerns that these tests can create. Her results challenged the privacy of her parents, her half-brother, and her half-brother\u2019s parents. Terry\u2019s results may ultimately affect the privacy of her biological father as well. She has sent messages to several people the database identified as her first cousins, thinking that they might know an uncle who donated sperm. Terry would have preferred that her parents had told her the truth, but she understands why they didn\u2019t. In fact, she\u2019s now keeping the same secret from a younger sibling who was conceived with a different sperm donor. As someone on the forum pointed out, Terry will have to keep her sibling away from 23andMe. 23ANDME SPELLS OUT SEVERAL PRIVACY ISSUES in its Terms of Service agreement. In the fifth of 28 sections, titled \u201cRisks and Considerations Regarding 23andMe Services,\u201d the company states several stark facts in bold type, including: In a different document, called the Privacy Statement, the company highlights possible consequences of sharing genetic information. \u201cPersonal Information, once released or shared, can be difficult to contain,\u201d it reads. \u201cIt is incumbent upon customers to share Personal Information only with people they know and trust.\u201d Family Tree DNA and Ancestry.com have similar agreements, though they\u2019re less explicit about these intangible risks. It\u2019s impossible to know, of course, how many customers ever read them. \u201cWe\u2019d like to believe that everyone who\u2019s accepted the terms has actually read them, but in practice we know that that\u2019s not always the case,\u201d says Catherine Afarian, a spokesperson for 23andMe. As the company\u2019s database grows, there are bound to be more people who find out family secrets. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of what actually happens in our society,\u201d Afarian says. Privacy is a top concern for the company, she adds, which is why the consent forms and privacy documents are written in clear and explicit language. \u201cWe try to be really upfront.\u201d For now, these issues haven\u2019t caused any legal problems or customer upsets, she says, and if they do, the company\u2019s privacy policy \u201ccould certainly evolve over time.\u201d Nor is privacy the only area where DNA testing\u2019s ethics are considered a work in progress. In November, 23andMe came under fire from the US Food and Drug Administration, for the part of its service that offers medical risk profiles. Customer results, delivered online with brief explanations of genetic indicators, such as Sandi\u2019s discovery that she was at high risk of cancer, therefore fall under the FDA\u2019s regulatory regime. The agency accused the company of failing to cooperate fully over a period of four years, and of failing to communicate at all for more than six months. And although 23andMe rebuffed the claims, the company has now stopped marketing its services, and faces a class action lawsuit from disgruntled customers. Cheryl has bought 16 kits from 23andMe, two for her (after her first one, she bought an updated version) and 14 on behalf of her friends and family. For each of them, she asked their permission and explained what she wanted to use the data for. But nobody ever read the forms. Still, not everybody is interested in playing the genetic genealogy game. When Cheryl asked her daughter Wendy\u2019s husband, Dennis Plear, if he\u2019d like to test, he flatly refused, and also forbade Wendy from having their children tested. Dennis, a disabled Navy veteran who is half African American and half German, is wary of such personal information winding up in the hands of the government. When told that these companies purport to be keeping the information secure and out of reach of third parties, Dennis wasn\u2019t impressed. \u201cIf you have it on file, on the internet, the government has access to it one way or another.\u201d But for every customer deterred by privacy concerns, there seem to be many more who don\u2019t care. Genetic genealogy databases are growing every day, and that pace will quicken as the costs of genetic sequencing drop. It\u2019s plausible that in the not-too-distant future, we\u2019ll all be identifiable in genetic databases, whether through our personal contribution or that of our relatives. Some ethicists have called for federal legislation to restrict these kinds of collections. But many scientists, including Erlich, are against that idea, pointing out that genetic databases can be used for good\u2014not only for genealogy, but for medical discoveries. \u201cWe cannot change the course of technology,\u201d Erlich says. Instead, he says, regulation should focus on preventing harm to individuals. For example, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), passed in the United States in 2008, says that health insurers and employers cannot use an individual\u2019s genetic information to deny medical coverage or to make employment decisions. \u201cGINA was a good step forward,\u201d Erlich says. \u201cIt\u2019s not about having the information\u2014 it\u2019s about not abusing it.\u201d FROM HER TRAINING AS A NURSE, Cheryl is aware of the need to respect other people\u2019s privacy. So in May of this year, when she first reached out to Effie Jane, she was wary of divulging too much, saying vaguely that she was interested in the Parker family line. About a week later, Effie Jane wrote her back saying she would be happy to talk to her. Over the next couple of weeks, Cheryl and Effie Jane shared many emails and phone calls, and discovered that they had a lot in common. \u201cI never felt like I was a part of my family,\u201d Effie Jane says. Her ruddy complexion and crystal-blue eyes look like Cheryl\u2019s, but that\u2019s the extent of their physical resemblance. Their childhoods, though, were similarly traumatic. Effie Jane started having seizures at six months old, and at 14 her mother died. Her father, Joseph Parker, like Cheryl\u2019s adoptive father, Joe, was cold and indifferent, and \u201cmay have had a little mental imbalance,\u201d Effie Jane says. After her mother died, his personality changed; for example, he instructed her to start calling him \u201cMr. Parker\u201d rather than \u201cDaddy.\u201d Effie Jane has felt rejected her whole life, but found acceptance in Cheryl. \u201cI had always prayed for a sister,\u201d she says. After meeting for the first time at Panera, the women kept talking, and slowly began to broach the sensitive subject on both of their minds: If they were indeed sisters, then how would Vivian have known Mr. Parker? Mr. Parker was a train engineer, and would often be away from home for days at a time. Vivian frequently took the same train he worked on to vacation with her family. So she could have known him for years. Or perhaps she met him just once. Maybe they were friendly; or, who knows, maybe she was raped. These were the theories that Cheryl and Effie Jane tossed around. They wouldn\u2019t know for sure until the test results came back. But Cheryl felt in her gut that this was the one. \u201cI\u2019m feeling really comfortable with where I\u2019m going with this. I feel like I\u2019m going to find answers soon.\u201d That\u2019s what Cheryl said to me during our first phone interview, in early July. She had been anxiously tracking the shipment of Effie Jane\u2019s kit and knew that it had arrived at 23andMe that Saturday. She had just a few weeks to wait. Cheryl and Effie Jane\u2019s relationship blossomed over that period. As Cheryl described in an email to Sandi, \u201cThere are a lot of things about Effie that seem familiar to me, as though we are of the same cloth.\u201d Cheryl and Effie Jane went to the cemetery where Mr. Parker is buried and snapped photos of his plaque. They also attended an all-day church workshop put on by Cheryl\u2019s son, Travis, about how to deal with rejection. \u201cMy mom has a hard time believing that we accept her,\u201d Travis says. \u201cBut that\u2019s because of the deck of cards that she\u2019s playing with.\u201d On July 23, Cheryl wrote to me with the surprising verdict: Effie Jane was not her sister. She was not even a first cousin once removed, as Diane had guessed. The genetic test estimated them as fourth cousins, at most, with just two shared segments of chromosome. I asked Cheryl how she was feeling about it, and her response read, to me, like she was trying to hide her disappointment: \u201cI am good! I am frustrated, as now we will have to find someone else to test, and wait yet again!\u201d Effie Jane took the news in stride. \u201cI didn\u2019t cry. I didn\u2019t have that feeling of being deserted by her,\u201d she told me. And the fact that you don\u2019t share much DNA, does that change how you feel about your relationship, I asked. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, she\u2019s my little sister.\u201d Cheryl, too, says she will probably be lifelong friends with Effie Jane. But there was still a hole in her personal history. And it needed to be filled. EFFIE JANE\u2019S TEST RESULTS WEREN\u2019T WHAT Cheryl was hoping for, but they did help her and Diane to focus on the relevant part of Jeannette\u2019s family tree. Diane quickly identified another man as Cheryl\u2019s potential father, and Cheryl tracked down the phone number of the man\u2019s daughter, Rose. Cheryl called Rose one morning in late July. The conversation went surprisingly well. \u201cShe said, \u2018Oh, are you saying you might be my sister? Oh, I hope you might be my sister!\u2019\u201d Cheryl recalls. Rose agreed to take a 23andMe test, and they tentatively planned to get together the following day to do the spitting. Late that evening, Cheryl had an upsetting phone call with Rose. The DNA test had been weighing on her the entire day, Rose said, and she had decided she didn\u2019t want to tarnish the memory of her father by taking it. \u201cOf course I was in tears,\u201d Cheryl told me the next morning. \u201cIt\u2019s like another rejection.\u201d Cheryl says she understands how Rose must be feeling. \u201cI am nobody to them.\u201d She is now trying to decide whether she should reach out to Rose\u2019s late brother\u2019s wife, to ask if her children might get tested. Cheryl knows that Rose would be upset if she did that; on the other hand, there may be no other way to find out who her father is. \u201cIt will make me feel more complete to know who I came from.\u201d Though she doesn\u2019t fully realize it, Cheryl is playing out the hypothetical scenario painted by bioethicists: How does one person\u2019s right to know stack up against another\u2019s right to privacy? WHILE SHE STRUGGLES WITH her search for a new family, Cheryl is trying to mend the tears that her genetic testing has created among the relatives she already has. In June of last year, the Village News, the local newspaper of Chester, ran a story about Cheryl\u2019s search for her biological father. The article included several factual inaccuracies, as well as a wildly inaccurate description of Joe as a man who \u201cstepped up to the plate making Vivian, as they said then, an honest woman.\u201d All of Cheryl\u2019s sisters were upset by the article. Sandi was upset because of what it implied about Vivian. \u201c[It] shed a somewhat dim light of my mom and some of the report was inaccurate and fabricated,\u201d she told me. \u201cI only want my parents\u2019 legacy to be respected.\u201d On the other hand, Cheryl\u2019s older siblings, her half-sisters by Vivian\u2019s first husband, were crushed by the description of Joe as an upstanding husband and father. \u201cMy sisters were furious. They really wanted to go for blood,\u201d says one of them, JoAnn Lear, who, unlike Cheryl, is tall and boisterous, with a tell-it-like-it-is demeanor. They thought about suing the newspaper, but decided the damage had already been done. I met JoAnn this past August, during a weekend I spent with Cheryl and Dickie at their home. On Saturday afternoon Cheryl organized a family reunion of sorts, so that I could meet her children, grandchildren, and Effie Jane. By the time I arrived, I had been talking to Cheryl on and off for several weeks about her hunt for her biological father. I was expecting to observe strained or awkward family relationships\u2014holes that Cheryl was trying to fill with her genetic search. Instead I was struck by the love, humor, and openness of Cheryl\u2019s family, new and old. When Effie Jane\u2014Cheryl\u2019s newest fourth cousin\u2014arrived, she hugged Cheryl and gave her a gift: a sand dollar. It was a \u201cHoly Ghost Shell,\u201d she explained, with the star in the center representing the Star of Bethlehem. Sandi wasn\u2019t at the reunion\u2014her colorectal cancer had by then spread to her lungs, and it was uncomfortable for her to leave her house or even to speak on the phone. (All of our discussions for this article happened through Facebook chats and emails; Sandi died on September 6, 2013.) Cheryl\u2019s three older sisters weren\u2019t there, either. None of them had talked to Cheryl much since the infamous Village News article had come out. JoAnn, though, had agreed to meet with us the next day. So Cheryl and I made the pretty, winding drive from her riverfront home to the suburbs of Richmond, where JoAnn lives, and picked her up for lunch and a ride around the small towns where they grew up. Cheryl and JoAnn had lost touch in recent years, but had recently reunited to care for Sandi. After about an hour and a half of driving around, we pulled into a quiet road called Mason Avenue, in Chester. \u201cIt was one of these two,\u201d said Cheryl from the back seat, pointing to two small houses. Each house used to hold two apartments, and one of them is where Cheryl, Sandi, Joe, and Vivian once lived. \u201cWe were there,\u201d JoAnn said. \u201cYou were?\u201d Cheryl said, astonished. \u201cI wonder if it was the same incident.\u201d \u201cHe was drunk. And he said he was going to kill us all,\u201d JoAnn continued, her voice welling up with emotion. \u201cWe got out of the house and we took off running, and he was shooting towards us.\u201d JoAnn continued with her memory of the story, and then Cheryl recounted hers. Then the car got quiet. After a minute, Cheryl finally said, \u201cYou know, JoAnn, we really do need to talk these things out between us.\u201d \u201cI know, I know,\u201d JoAnn said.

At some point, they realized that a large number of the \u201cfemale\u201d accounts were actually bait for porn sites and 1\u2013900 numbers. I don\u2019t remember if users complained or if they found it themselves, but they concluded that they needed to get rid of these fake profiles. So they did. And then their numbers started dropping. And dropping. And dropping. Trying to understand why, researchers were sent in. What they learned was that hot men were attracted to the site because there were women that they felt were out of their league. Most of these hot men didn\u2019t really aim for these ultra-hot women, because they felt like they would be inaccessible, but they were happy to talk with women who they saw as being one rung down (as in actual hot women). These hot women, meanwhile, were excited to have these hot men (who they saw as equals) on the site. These also felt that, since there were women hotter than them, that this was a site for them. When they removed the fakes, the hot men felt the site was no longer for them. They disappeared. And then so did the hot women. Etc. The weirdest part? They reintroduced decoy profiles (not as redirects to porn but as fake women who just didn\u2019t respond) and slowly folks came back. Why am I telling you this story? Fake accounts and bots on social media are not new. Yet, in the last couple of weeks, there\u2019s been newfound hysteria around Twitter bots and fake accounts. I find it deeply problematic that folks are saying that having fake followers is inauthentic. This is like saying that makeup is inauthentic. What is really going on here? From the earliest days of Friendster and MySpace, people liked to show how cool they were by how many friends they had. As Alice Marwick eloquently documented, self-branding and performing status were the name of the game for many in the early days of social media. This hasn\u2019t changed. People made entire careers out of appearing to be influential, not just actually being influential. Of course a market emerged around this so that people could buy and sell followers, friends, likes, comments, etc. Indeed, standard practice, especially in the wink-nudge world of Instagram, where monetized content is the game and so-called organic \u201cmacroinfluencers\u201d can easily double their follower size through bots are more than happily followed by bots, paid or not. Some sites have tried to get rid of fake accounts. Indeed, Friendster played whack-a-mole with them, killing off \u201cFakesters\u201d and any account that didn\u2019t follow their strict requirements; this prompted a mass exodus. Facebook\u2019s real-name policy also signaled that such shenanigans would not be allowed on their site, although shhh\u2026. lots of folks figured out how to have multiple accounts and otherwise circumvent the policy. And let\u2019s be honest\u200a\u2014\u200afake accounts are all over most online dating profiles. Ashley Madison, anyone? Bots have been an intrinsic part of Twitter since the early days. Following the Pope\u2019s daily text messaging services, the Vatican set up numerous bots offering Catholics regular reflections. Most major news organizations have bots so that you can keep up with the headlines of their publications. Twitter\u2019s almost-anything-goes policy meant that people have built bots for all sorts of purposes. There are bots that do poetry, ones that argue with anti-vaxxers about their beliefs, and ones that call out sexist comments people post. I\u2019m a big fan of the @censusAmericans bot created by FiveThirtyEight to regularly send out data from the Census about Americans. Over the last year, sentiment towards Twitter\u2019s bots has become decidedly negative. Perhaps most people didn\u2019t even realize that there were bots on the site. They probably don\u2019t think of @NYTimes as a bot. When news coverage obsesses over bots, they primarily associate the phenomenon with nefarious activities meant to seed discord, create chaos, and do harm. It can all be boiled down to: Russian bots. As a result, Congress saw bots as inherently bad and journalists keep accusing Twitter of having a \u201cbot problem\u201d without accounting for how their stories appear on Twitter through bots. Although we often hear about the millions and millions of bots on Twitter as though they\u2019re all manipulative, the stark reality is that bots can be quite fun. I had my students build Twitter bots to teach them how these things worked\u200a\u2014\u200athey had a field day, even if they didn\u2019t get many followers. Of course, there are definitely bots that you can buy to puff up your status. Some of them might even be Russian built. And here\u2019s where we get to the crux of the current conversation. People buy bots to increase their number of followers, retweets, and likes in order to appear cooler than they are. Think of this as mascara for your digital presence. While plenty of users are happy chatting away with their friends without their makeup on, there\u2019s an entire class of professionals who feel the need to be dolled up and giving the best impression possible. It\u2019s a competition for popularity and status, marked by numbers. Number games are not new, especially not in the world of media. Take a well-established firm like Nielsen. Although journalists often uncritically quote Nielsen numbers as though they are \u201cfact,\u201d most people in the ad and media business know that they\u2019re crap. But they\u2019ve long been the best crap out there. And, more importantly, they\u2019re uniform crap so businesses can make predictable decisions off of these numbers, fully aware that they might not be that accurate. The same has long been true of page views and clicks. No major news organization should their page views literally. And yet, lots of news agencies rank their reporters based on this data. What makes the purchasing of Twitter bots and status so nefarious? The NYTimes story suggests that doing so is especially deceptive. Their coverage shamed Twitter into deleting a bunch of Twitter accounts, outing all of the public figures who had bought bots. It almost felt like a discussion of who had gotten Botox. Much of this recent flurry of coverage suggests that the so-called bot problem a new thing that is \u201cfinally\u201d known. It boggles my mind to think that any regular Twitter user hadn\u2019t seen automated accounts in the past. And heck, there have been services like Twitter Audit to see how many fake followers you have since at least 2012. Gilad Lotan even detailed the ecosystem of buying fake followers in 2014. I think that what\u2019s new is that the term \u201cbot\u201d is suddenly toxic. And it gives us an opportunity to engage in another round of social shaming targeted at insecure people\u2019s vanity all under the false pretense of being about bad foreign actors. I\u2019ve never been one to feel the need to put on a lot of makeup in order to leave the house and I haven\u2019t been someone who felt the need to buy bots to appear cool online. But I find it deeply hypocritical to listen to journalists and politicians wring their hands about fake followers and bots given that they\u2019ve been playing at that game for a long time. Who among them is really innocent of trying to garner attention through any means possible? At the end of the day, I don\u2019t really blame Twitter for giving these deeply engaged users what they want and turning a blind eye towards their efforts to puff up their status online. After all, the cosmetic industry is $55 billion. Then again, even cosmetic companies sometimes change their formulas when their products receive bad press.

Insular and unsophisticated, less than 40-percent have a passport, according to Pew Research. So far removed from any reality outside their corner of the map, they fail to understand that Americans do not lose their rights when they travel, or live, outside the USA. That\u2019s okay. The most closeted Americans seem to put a slathering of Trump support on top of their Parochial potato and by the time they\u2019ve popped the top on their favorite brew they\u2019re satisfied with their belief that any media outlet which doesn\u2019t agree with their narrow-minded approach to life is \u2018fake news.\u2019 That\u2019s a mouthful. Sadly, their ignorance is self-imposed. They are the walking-wounded of witlessness. For the rest of America, those that have a passport and can find foreign nations on a map without help, the life of an expat can be a refreshing and challenging change. As long as records have been kept, approximately 400 Americans renounced their citizenship each year\u200a\u2014\u200auntil 2017. That year, a record number of Americans\u200a\u2014\u200aover 2400, according to the U.S. State Department\u200a\u2014\u200aturned their back on their citizenship, paid $2500 for the privilege of giving America the finger and starting life over, well, overseas. A person doesn\u2019t have to renounce citizenship to be an expat. Many people move abroad annually and still maintain the land of the free and the home of the brave as their home. The next time you\u2019re in South America, look me up. Together we\u2019ll laugh and try to figure out exactly how long an American has to be overseas before they lose their rights.

You will think that I am shaming, blaming, and judging you. I am not. My goal is precisely the opposite: to free you a little bit from that. But that is for you to judge, and first we must, as they say, \u201cwork through\u201d those very issues. Over the last couple of decades, a curious observation has struck me everytime I look at American culture. It seems a little more childish every year. It is a regressive culture\u200a\u2014\u200anot just socially, but emotionally regressive, as in \u201cgoing back to acting and thinking like children\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aand I will come to how the two are linked. I am going to start with what will strike you superficial. First let us consider self expression. Americans, by now, quite literally look like little children. Sorry. Someone has to say it. Sweatpants and yoga pants and oversized suits and Untuckits, no attention to whether garments fit or even have a shape\u200a\u2014\u200athis kind of absence of self-care isn\u2019t quite so acceptable, let alone desirable, in other cultures. It\u2019s a little Soviet, this giving up on expressing one\u2019s self. Still, do personal appearances matter? Am I being unfair? I can\u2019t count how many superhero movies and shows there are available on my TV. There are more produced by the week. The point isn\u2019t that they\u2019re bad. I enjoy some myself. It is that no other society in the world needs or has so many. Who is obsessed with superheroes\u200a\u2014\u200aand the villains they must fight? Little children. But these shows are not for children\u200a\u2014\u200athey are for adults, to inhabit whole parallel universes. But self-help books and reality TV and whole bizarre new genres of fabulism\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cAncient Aliens\u201d and \u201cHitler\u2019s Still Alive!!\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aare about superheroes and supervillains, too. In no other place do I get a culture that is made not just for an emotional five year old\u200a\u2014\u200abut will keep you one if you consume it. What does such a culture tell us? Well, they point to another fact of American life: it is marked by magical fairy tales about salvation, made of black-and-white thinking. Ironically, in history, quite literally\u200a\u2014\u200abut still to this day. Good and evil are absolutist affairs. Heroes save us from villains\u200a\u2014\u200aheroes like the Ancient Aliens. People are infallible heroes\u200a\u2014\u200aright up until they are unforgivable villains. Those dirty nations are evil, we are good. Lazy is bad, work is good. Capitalism good, socialism bad. Rigid, magical, incurious, dichotomized thinking is regressive, too \u2014a sign of abuse in children\u200a\u2014\u200abut what does it point to? Where does it come from? From stunted moral development. American life is uniquely marked by a Lex Talionis principle\u200a\u2014\u200aan eye for an eye. But this is also the moral logic of a child. It\u2019s funny\u200a\u2014\u200ayou break a tiny rule and the baby, a little tyrant, lectures you, wagging a cute little finger. But why do children exact such harsh moral punishments? Salvation fairy tales, remember? Children think they risk retribution by fates and gods if you aren\u2019t punished severely for not following the rules exactly, too. The fear of shame overwhelms them. Talionic thought has suffocated America\u2014 incarceration, militarism, bigotry\u2014 but it is only a reflection of a childlike level of moral development, in which the criminal is not the one who risks being punished, but the shameful one who fails to punish him hardest, too. Now. It is not that regression is bad per se. It is not. Quite the opposite. But there is healthy regression, and unhealthy regression. Healthy regression is the baby play we engage in with our pets and loved ones\u200a\u2014\u200ait is a feeling of being nourished emotionally, loved unconditionally, a return to the oceanic primal state of the womb. But a baby can be a spiteful, envious, enraged thing, too. Unhealthy regression is just that: insatiable shame, which, never satisfied, drives intense envy and rage at anyone that gets such love. Anyone that gets such love. In psychology, we might call this sibling rivalry\u200a\u2014\u200aif mommy or daddy love you more, I will feel ashamed, and hurt you. But isn\u2019t that precisely the operative social law we see in American life? American life is permeated by a culture of cruelty. One the world is by now a little aghast at. The smallest infraction of the rules can yield a homeless, ruined, destroyed life. Every tiny interaction is filled with dread and spite and a sense of vengeance\u200a\u2014\u200afrom buying groceries to going to work to sending a tweet. What explains this? This is a kind of regressive rivalry, shame giving way to childlike envy and spite, instead of adult development. People do not lift one another up in any way whatsoever\u200a\u2014\u200afrom investing in one another\u2019s healthcare, to being decent to one another\u200a\u2014\u200abecause they cannot. They are ashamed of who they feel they are\u200a\u2014\u200aunloved little children, unworthy, alone, afraid. Stuck in an unhealthy, rivalrous regression, they are competing for the tiny bits of love left in a broken society. Now. Who is loving them? Or at least caring for, nurturing, and protecting them? You see, we do not regress unless we are threatened\u200a\u2014\u200aor we have been abused to the point that we have never grown into adults. So which one of these explains America\u2019s childlike culture? If we look at American life, there is another curious fact: it tells itself it is the most egalitarian society in modern existence, but in fact it is the most hierarchical society in the rich world. How do Americans spend their lives? In titanic hierarchies. They are born, they ascend through the hierarchy of grade school\u200a\u2014\u200athat much is true in every other country. But right on the cusp of adulthood, a globally unique set of hierarchies hit them: they go to college, and there, instead of being peers, life is organized via extreme hierarchy again. Not a member of a frat? The right sorority? Then they leave college, and work life is again a choice between megacorporations, which again are ordered hierarchically, not just inside, but also socially, according to prestige and power and so on. Thus, extreme hierarchy dominates American life to an extreme it doesn\u2019t elsewhere\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially not in rich countries. That is why CEO to worker pay is the highest, as is inequality, indignity, inopportunity, and so on. Yet the cultural meaning of all this is that Americans do not see one another as equals\u200a\u2014\u200abut as rivals. What does hierarchy teach us? It teaches us obedience. It teaches us revenge. It teaches us power-seeking, through cunning. It teaches us conformity. In other words, hierarchy teaches us that we are children, who can never grow up. Extreme hierarchy keeps Americans regressed, never allowing them the feeling of safety that children need to explore, play, and grow beyond a child state. How? Hierarchy tells us that we can never be safe or loved as we are\u200a\u2014\u200aonly for the position that we occupy, which is usually the very one we have given our true selves up to get. And so children raised in extreme hierarchies often spend their whole lives searching for substitute parents in spouses, bosses, and so on, to validate and appreciate them as perfect, and grow jealous and spiteful and enraged when they are not. Ah, doesn\u2019t that sound exactly like American culture? Now that brings us to fascism. Why did fascism ascend so swiftly and suddenly in America? The answer by now is very simple. American culture left Americans at the emotional level of something like neglected children. They applied moral Talionis laws. They sought salvation by superheroes. They divided the world into good and evil. Hierarchy taught them to treat one another as vicious rivals, not peers\u2014 for only perfection and greatness could earn the love and safety of parental figures, which they never learned to give themselves, or each other. And along came a strongman. What was a nation that was made to feel inside like ashamed, unloved children, raised on grandiose superhero fantasies, fighting one another desperately for a sense of safety and belonging, already desperately always looking for substitute parents, through conformity and obedience and envy, going to do, but flee into his arms? American culture was like a lock, that kept people regressed children\u200a\u2014\u200aand fascism was the key. A nation kept emotional infants needed a stern, commanding, authoritarian father figure\u200a\u2014\u200aand it got one. I said that the point of this essay was to free you, a little bit, from shame. I am sure that if you have read this far, you are reacting strongly. That is shame leaving, in the form of anger, perhaps. Breathe. Give this burden you have been carrying too long away now. Perhaps the world makes a little more sense\u200a\u2014\u200abut, as I have said, that is for you to judge.

For context, a lightning talk is normally around five minutes long. Last autumn, I was invited to Foo Camp, an unconference organized by O\u2019Reilly Media. O\u2019Reilly have held Foo Camps since 2003, and the events are invitation-only (hence the name: Friends of O\u2019Reilly). Foo Camp 2017\u2019s theme was about how we (i.e. the attendees and, I understand, technologists in general) could \u201cbring about a better future by making smart choices about the intersection of technology and the economy.\u201d This intersection of technology and the economy (which is a bit of a, shall we say, passive way of describing the current economic change and disruption) is clearly an interest of Tim O\u2019Reilly\u2019s (the eponymous O\u2019Reilly); he\u2019s recently written a book, WTF? What\u2019s the Future and Why It\u2019s Up to Us, about the subject. One part of the unconference structure of a Foo Camp is the lightning talks: quick, 5 minute \u201cprovocative\u201d talks about a subject. I\u2019d been thinking and writing about technology\u2019s role in society for a while in my newsletter (admittedly from an amateur, non-academic point of view), so Foo Camp\u2019s lightning talks provided a good opportunity to pull my thoughts together in front of an audience of peers and experts. The talk I submitted was titled \u201cThe very model of modern humanist technologists\u201d, and this essay is an adaptation for a wider audience. While the theme of 2017\u2019s Foo Camp was how \u201cwe\u201d could bring about a better future by making smart choices about the intersection of technology and the economy, I made the case that the only way for \u201cus\u201d to bring about that better future is through some sort of technological humanism. To make that case\u200a\u2014\u200aultimately a case for restraint and more considered progress rather than the stereotypical call to action to move fast and break things\u200a\u2014\u200aI decided to tell a personal story. You see, when I make this case for humane technology, I\u2019m making it as both a technologist and a non-technologist. In this photograph, I\u2019m probably around 4 or 5 years old. My parents moved from Hong Kong to the United Kingdom sometime in the 1970s as part of the diaspora. Their parents \u201csent them away\u201d: the idea being that their children, and thus their grandchildren would have access to a better education and a better life in the United Kingdom. Both my parents are academics\u200a\u2014\u200amy dad\u2019s a professor of manufacturing and my mother has a doctorate in educational linguistics. Education was important to them, and in the way that we learn about what\u2019s important by watching the adults in our lives, what was important to them became important to me. I was born in 1979, the same year that The Usborne Book of the Future was published. The Usborne Book of the Future told an optimistic story of how humanity would use technology to solve problems and thrive. This book would become a sort of comfort book to me: I could retreat into its pages and read about a safer, fairer, more equitable and exciting future that would be realized within my lifetime. When you\u2019re worried about not fitting in, the promise of a future where everyone belongs is pretty alluring. I was also incredibly lucky. As a lecturer and later a professor, my dad would borrow computers and equipment from his lab at the university to show them to his family at home. One of my earliest memories is of him bringing home a BBC Micro and being terrified at the sound\u200a\u2014\u200anot the graphics\u200a\u2014\u200aof Galaxian when I was around four years old. Another story: one day, in the mid 80s, my dad arrived home with a giant piece of paper, bigger than me. It was a CAD rendering of the Space Shuttle. I thought it was amazing. I thought he was amazing\u200a\u2014\u200ahe\u2019d taken a bit of that future and brought it into our living room. Right then, Shuttle was a symbol of a better future, tantalizingly close. I would have been six years old. What else? Like many others\u200a\u2014\u200aand many people here too, I suspect\u200a\u2014\u200aI grew up with these paintings commissioned by NASA imagining how we\u2019d live in space in the future: They showed how technology would save us. How technology and science would make everything better. They showed a fairer future. In that future, everyone would belong, and nobody would feel left out. Who wouldn\u2019t want that? (Later, I would have the experience and wisdom to look back on these images and think about everything that wasn\u2019t in these paintings of the future, about all the people and cultures who were missing.) For a kid growing up in the 80s and 90s, this vision of the future, of fitting in, of being accepted was seductive. Especially so for a second-generation immigrant. And over the course of the 80s and 90s, it felt like there was a consensus forming: computers would be a massive part of our future. They\u2019d be integral in bringing in about those visions of a fairer, more equitable future. In the future, I would have my very own computer watch, complete with an emergency button I could press to summon emergency services. I have that watch, now. By the time I got exposed to bulletin boards in the early 1990s, I was hooked. Later, figuring out how to use my dad\u2019s academic SLIP account in the mid 90s convinced me. I became a believer. On the Internet, in a connected society, everyone would be equal. Everyone would be accepted. What we looked like, our gender, our meat wouldn\u2019t matter. What was on the inside would count more than what was on the outside. And, as I\u2019ve spoken to friends about this, they agreed: for a brief moment in the 1990s, it was possible for a woman in technology (albeit more likely than not, a white, professional woman) to be accepted just for what she knew. At the same time, against the growing importance and belief that the internet would be a force for good, there was my growing understanding and acceptance of the fact that we\u2019re a tool-making, tool-using technological species. In my talk, I made this point by using the infamous match cut from Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001, of humanity\u2019s monolith-manipulated ancestors learning to use bones as tools and jumping in time to a space-faring civilization. I believed that our use of technology was a reason to be optimistic. That it is a reason for us to be optimistic, for we use technology to solve problems. (I mean sure, crows do it too. But crows haven\u2019t left our gravity well and as far as we know they don\u2019t think digital watches are neat, so: sucks to be crows.) All of the above is to show that I\u2019m a technologist. I\u2019m born of a generation, I think, that was optimistic, if not utopian and our intentions were good, even while our knowledge or experience wasn\u2019t yet mature. In that way, I consider myself a technologist: that we create technology to solve problems, and solving those problems is part of the way to a better society for ourselves and those who come after us. Tim O\u2019Reilly is clearly a technologist, too. If there were any doubt, in the introduction to 2017\u2019s Foo Camp, he stated that \u201ctechnology is ultimately the solution to human problems.\u201d I agree. Look: growing up, I felt like computers were amazing. Not only did they help me do wonderful, brilliant things in the present, but I felt like I could see and was persuaded by their potential. I was\u200a\u2014\u200aand remain convinced\u200a\u2014\u200athat computing is an amplifier for all the beauty and sadness and for all the hope and despair of humanity. The new media and online communities I immersed and surrounded myself in during the 90s and early 2000s led to deep, long-lasting friendships, family and children. As a technologist, I think one of the stories we told ourselves was that networked computing would fix things. Or at the very least would improve things. That the technology would prove to be an accelerator and an amplifier of the arc of history bending toward justice. In that respect, I think we got part of what we wanted, in that networked computing would have the best chance of fixing things if it were ubiquitous. Sometime during the last 10 years, thanks to an incredibly complicated intersection of Moore\u2019s law, globalism, neoliberal capitalism, the military industrial complex, colonialism and some really hard work, computing got cheap enough. Network access became wireless and then pervasive enough that we hit a qualitative change. \u201cEnough\u201d people have access to networked computing now, to the extent that as technologists we\u2019re capable of making jokes about most computing power not feeling like \u201ccomputers\u201d. The trendlines of the world\u2019s major social networks are pointing upwards and feel unstoppable. It feels inevitable that everyone will get networked, in some fashion. But I think we\u2019ve clearly reached a point that enough people now have access to networked computing, at any time, in any location. This is the qualitative change that I\u2019m talking about, a sort of point of no return where networked technologies can be deployed easily enough, quickly enough that their effects aren\u2019t just more-or-less limited to early adopter communities. The webcam isn\u2019t being pointed at just one coffee pot. It wants to be pointed at every coffee pot\u200a\u2014\u200aand now, it just about can. When enough people gained access to networked computing (available at any time, in any location) the effects that networked computing enabled didn\u2019t just happen to a comparatively small group of technologists. They started to happen to other people, too. To everyone. Platforms like Twitter and, later, Strava, started for small, like-minded groups. These affinity groups (a particular social group in the Bay Area, semi-pro athletes for Strava) had at least some set of shared expectations around privacy, for example. But when those platforms grow past their original audiences into wider ones (commonly propelled by growth expectations placed upon them by investment), those privacy expectations change. When Strava grew past a semi-pro athlete social network into one that\u2019s aiming to attract amateur/casual athletes, into a more mass market, effects and outcomes qualitatively change. Those effects then have to be dealt with as platforms interact with greater segments of society. This seems like a trite observation, but I think it\u2019s fundamental to the psychology and culture of stereotypical west coast style technologists. And, for what it\u2019s worth, I also think it\u2019s applicable to people in general. The ability to systemically affect entire societies in such short timespans isn\u2019t something that I believe we\u2019re intuitively geared up to deal with without very, very deliberately engaging Kahneman\u2019s System 2. And yet everything isn\u2019t better. Sure, some things are better. Networked, global neoliberal capitalism has certainly and undeniably lifted many out of poverty. But at the same time, the world we\u2019re living in isn\u2019t the drastically improved society of people living in harmony I was promised as a child. The 2017 my children and I live in is a messy, human future. One where we talk about the inadvertent algorithmic cruelty of being awkwardly reminded to celebrate your child\u2019s death. Where people worry about the energy expenditure of a cryptocurrency. My talk was originally written for a select gathering (to be clear, Foo Camp has been criticised, and rightly so, as being problematic in terms of inclusivity and diversity) of influential technologists worried that we need to make smarter choices about technology and its effects on our economy. But I\u2019m worried that just thinking about technology and our economy isn\u2019t going to help. If technology is the solution to human problems, we need to do the human work to figure out and agree what our problems are and the kind of society we want. Then we can figure out what technology we want and need to bring about the society we want. Otherwise we\u2019re back to a coordination problem: which problems, what ones? In my talk I put forward the suspicion that many of the technologists gathered in the room weren\u2019t attending just because smarter decisions needed to be made with regard to considered technology and the future of the economy. I suspected that many were in the room because, at the end of the day, everything wasn\u2019t going quite as well as we thought or wished. Because the better future promised by the books we grew up with didn\u2019t automatically happen when enough people got connected. Because we know we need to do better. Because inequality is rising, not decreasing. Because of what feels like rising incidences of hate and abuse, like gamergate. Because of algorithmic cruelty. Because of YouTube and Logan Paul and YouTube and child exploitation. Because right now, it feels like things are getting worse. Here\u2019s what I think. I think we need to figure out what society we want first. The future we want. And then we figure out the technology, the tools, that will get us there. Because if we\u2019re a tool-making, tool-using species that uses technology to solve human problems, then the real question is this: what problems shall we choose to solve? In my talk, I explored just one question that I think will help us in that journey. I think we need to question our gods. By gods, I mean the laws, thinking, aphorisms and habits that we as technologists assume to be true and that appear to guide development of technology. I\u2019ve got two examples. The first is Metcalfe\u2019s Law. The Metcalfe is Robert Metcalfe, a co-inventor of Ethernet, a stupendously successful networking standard. You wouldn\u2019t be reading this, in this way, were it not for Metcalfe. Metcalfe\u2019s law says that the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system. Most technologists know of this law, or a version of it. One of the ways people think about and illustrate Metcalfe\u2019s Law is by understanding that a telephone or fax machine isn\u2019t particularly useful on its own (the examples go to show how comparatively old the law is), but that two are much more useful. Four even more so, and so on. These understandings are a bit like folk understandings. Lately, Metcalfe\u2019s law has been applied to social networks and not just to equipment that\u2019s connected together. Applying Metcalfe\u2019s law to social networks is a sort of folk understanding that the more users your social network has, the more valuable it is. If you value value, then, the law points you in the direction of increasing the number of your users. The problem is, I like to ask dumb questions. Asking dumb questions has served me well in my career. Asking dumb questions in this case means I have two simple questions about the law: First: why do we call Metcalfe\u2019s law a law? Has it been proven to be true? Second: What do we mean, exactly, by value? Now, it turns out Bob Metcalfe did his homework. In 2013, he published a paper (\u201cMetcalfe\u2019s Law after 40 Years of Ethernet\u201d) testing his law in response to critics who had called it \u201ca gross overestimation of the network effect\u201d. Metcalfe found that his theory (remember: not a law) was true. So, how did Metcalfe define \u201cvalue\u201d in his paper? Metcalfe used Facebook\u2019s revenue as a definition of value and found that it fit his law. Revenue is, of course, just one way of measuring value. One could drive a truck through all the things that revenue doesn\u2019t represent that individuals, groups or whole societies might choose to value. For example: does revenue reflect the potential or actual value of harm done in allowing (intentionally or inadvertently) foreign interference in a democratic nation state\u2019s elections? The week I presented this talk, representatives of Facebook and Twitter were testifying to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism in Washington, D.C. Does revenue also reflect the value of harm done to society in both allowing and signalling that allowing advertising that breaks housing discrimination laws is acceptable, a year after being notified? It doesn\u2019t. So maybe revenue isn\u2019t the only mechanism through which we can measure value. Maybe there are a whole bunch of other things that networks do that we want to pay attention to that might be important or, I guess, valuable. Maybe networks don\u2019t automatically, positively, affect those values. Being more deliberate about what we choose to value as a society and whether some measures (e.g. revenue) are able to sufficiently proxy others is part of a current, wider discussion. For example: should the economic value of breast milk be included in when calculating gross domestic product? Over the last couple hundred years, our dominant cultures have done a terrible job of considering negative externalities, the things that we don\u2019t see or choose not to measure when we think about how systems work. There\u2019s an argument one could make that the now dominant global, networked capitalism model incentivizes only certain methods of valuation. Of the more recent examples, it may already be too late for us to effectively deal with climate change. Perhaps it\u2019s time for us to retire the belief\u200a\u2014\u200abecause that\u2019s what it is, just a belief\u200a\u2014\u200athat networks with large numbers of users without other attributes are an unqualified good. My second example comes back to John Perry Barlow\u2019s 1996 manifesto and declaration of the independence of cyberspace. In his manifesto, Barlow (excitedly and optimistically) proclaimed that cyberspace presented an opportunity for new social contracts to be negotiated by individuals that would identify and address wrongs and conflicts. In 2016, The Economist asked Barlow for reflections on his manifesto with the benefit of twenty years of hindsight. First, he says that he would\u2019ve been a bit more humble about the \u201cCitizens of Cyberspace\u201d creating social contracts to deal with bad behavior online. In the early, heady rush of the young internet, where an accident of starting conditions meant it was easy to find certain like-minded people, it was easy to think that \u201csmart\u201d people would build a new, equitable society. We know now in retrospect that new social contracts weren\u2019t created to effectively deal with bad behavior. Some people may have been warning that this wasn\u2019t particularly likely for quite a while. While I admit that I\u2019m cherry picking Barlow\u2019s quotes here, there\u2019s one in particular that I want to highlight: When Barlow said \u201cthe fact remains that there is not much one can do about bad behavior online except to take faith that the vast majority of what goes on there is not bad behavior,\u201d his position was that we should accept the current state of affairs because there is literally no room for improvement. At this point in delivering my talk, I broke out a swear word between \u201ccitation\u201d and \u201cneeded\u201d because, to be completely candid, I was angry. Saying \u201cthere isn\u2019t anything better we can do\u201d isn\u2019t how society works. It isn\u2019t how civilization works. It isn\u2019t how people work together and protect those amongst us who cannot protect themselves. It is a little bit like saying on the one hand that the condition underlying human existence is nasty, brutish and short, and on the other, writing off any progress humanity has made to make our lives less nasty, kinder and longer. In my opinion, Barlow\u2019s opinions on online behavior, given his standing and influence were irresponsible. Saying \u201cwe can do nothing\u201d is what America says in response to the latest mass shooting when every other civilized country is able to regulate the responsible ownership of firearms. Saying \u201cwe can do nothing\u201d is like saying it\u2019s not worth having laws or standards because we can\u2019t achieve perfection. We would do better to be clear: is it true that we can do nothing? Or is it true that we choose to do nothing? (In a way, this highlights to me the bait-and-switch with a belief that machine learning or AI will solve fundamental problems for us. Ultimately, these choices are ours to make.) Barlow\u2019s opinion needs to be seen in context and helpfully leads me to my final points. Not because we\u2019re technologists, but because we\u2019re people, we\u2019re responsible to society for the tools we make. I suggest that for a number of reasons\u200a\u2014\u200aone of them being that technology wasn\u2019t yet pervasive amongst society\u200a\u2014\u200atechnologists in general (and recently and in particular, the strain of technology centered around the West Coast of the United States), have operated on general idea that as technologists we\u2019re apart from society. That, like scientists, we discover and invent new things and then it\u2019s up to \u201cthem\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200asociety, government, and so on\u200a\u2014\u200ato figure out and deal with the implications and results. This argument isn\u2019t entirely wrong: it is society and our government\u2019s job to \u201cfigure out\u201d and \u201cdeal with\u201d the implications and results of technology, but it\u2019s disingenuous of the technological class (and to be more accurate, its flag-wavers and leaders) to sidestep participation and responsiblity. In other words: nobody, not even technologists, is apart from society. Society is all of us, and we all have a responsibility to it. This is all very well and good. But what can we do? And more precisely, what \u201cwe\u201d? There\u2019s increasing acceptance of the reality that the world we live in is intersectional and we all play different and simultaneous roles in our lives. The society of \u201cwe\u201d includes technologists who have a chance of affecting the products and services, it includes customers and users, it includes residents and citizens. I\u2019ve made this case above, but I feel it\u2019s important enough to make again: at a high level, I believe that we need to: This work is hard and, arguably, will never be completed. It necessarily involves compromise. Attitudes, beliefs and what\u2019s considered just changes over time. That said, the above are two high level goals, but what can people do right now? What can we do tactically? I have two questions that I think can be helpful in guiding our present actions, in whatever capacity we might find ourselves. At the most general level, we are all members of a society, embedded in existing governing structures. It certainly feels like in the recent past, those governing structures are coming under increasing strain, and part of the blame is being laid at the feet of technology. One of the most important things we can do collectively is to produce clarity and prioritization where we can. Only by being clearer and more intentional about the kind of society we want and accepting what that means, can our societies and their institutions provide guidance and leadership to technology. These are questions that cannot and should not be left to technologists alone. Advances in technology mean that encryption is a societal issue. Content moderation and censorship are a societal issue. Ultimately, it should be for governments (of the people, by the people) to set expectations and standards at the societal level, not organizations accountable only to a board of directors and shareholders. But to do this, our governing institutions will need to evolve and improve. It is easier, and faster, for platforms now to react to changing social mores. For example, platforms are responding in reaction to society\u2019s reaction to \u201cAI-generated fake porn\u201d faster than governing and enforcing institutions. Prioritizations may necessarily involve compromise, too: the world is not so simple, and we are not so lucky, that it can be easily and always divided into A or B, or good or not-good. Some of my perspective in this area is reflective of the schism American politics is currently experiencing. In a very real way, America, my adoptive country of residence, is having to grapple with revisiting the idea of what America is for. The same is happening in my country of birth with the decision to leave the European Union. These are fundamental issues. Technologists, as members of society, have a point of view on them. But in the way that post-enlightenment governing institutions were set up to protect against asymmetric distribution of power, technology leaders must recognize that their platforms are now an undeniable, powerful influence on society. As a society, we must do the work to have a point of view. What does responsible technology look like? As technologists, we can be excited about re-inventing approaches from first principles. We must resist that impulse here, because there are things that we can do now, that we can learn now, from other professions, industries and areas to apply to our own. For example: My final point is this: no one will tell us or give us permission to do these things. There is no higher organizing power working to put systemic changes in place. There is no top-down way of nudging the arc of technology toward one better aligned with humanity. It starts with all of us. I\u2019ve been working on the bigger themes behind this talk since\u00a0\u2026, and an invitation to 2017\u2019s Foo Camp was a good opportunity to try to clarify and improve my thinking so that it could fit into a five minute lightning talk. It also helped that Foo Camp has the kind of (small, hand-picked\u200a\u2014\u200aagain, for good and ill) influential audience who would be a good litmus test for the quality of my argument, and would be instrumental in taking on and spreading the ideas. In the end, though, I nearly didn\u2019t do this talk at all. Around 6:15pm on Saturday night, just over an hour before the lightning talks were due to start, after the unconference\u2019s sessions had finished and just before dinner, I burst into tears talking to a friend. While I won\u2019t break the societal convention of confidentiality that helps an event like Foo Camp be productive, I\u2019ll share this: the world felt too broken. Specifically, the world felt broken like this: I had the benefit of growing up as a middle-class educated individual (albeit, not white) who believed he could trust that institutions were a) capable and b) would do the right thing. I now live in a country where a) the capability of those institutions has consistently eroded over time, and b) those institutions are now being systematically dismantled, to add insult to injury. In other words, I was left with the feeling that there\u2019s nothing left but ourselves. Do you want the poisonous lead removed from your water supply? Your best bet is to try to do it yourself. Do you want a better school for your children? Your best bet is to start it. Do you want a policing policy that genuinely rehabilitates rather than punishes? Your best bet is to\u2026 And it\u2019s just. Too. Much. Over the course of the next few days, I managed to turn my outlook around. The answer, of course, is that it is too much for one person. But it isn\u2019t too much for all of us. Ideas don\u2019t come into being on their own. Here are some of the people who have influenced me and some of the reading that I\u2019ve built upon when putting together my thoughts. If you\u2019re interested in following people who produce some of the raw material that I used to put together this talk, you should follow: By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

To even mention the word is to get pundits across the spectrum to seize up and instinctively balk, clutch their pearls, recoil as if struck by a cattle prod. Indeed, when Ta-Nehisi Coates published his now incredibly famous (or infamous) article \u201cThe Case for Reparations\u201d in 2014, it often seemed that the furious reaction to it was based far more on the title alone (or really, just the \u201cr\u201d word) than anything he wrote in the article itself. Conservatives in particular seem averse to any discussion of reparations for Black Americans. It requires dealing directly with the most uncomfortable parts of America\u2019s past, the problems of its present, and the question of whether it even deserves a future. To even touch on the subject or discuss it would seemingly open a Pandora\u2019s Box which would lead only to ruin. But is this fear justified? One conservative rejoinder when discussing reparations is that this is an insidious left-wing idea, part and parcel of a long standing socialist and progressive approach in favor of a \u201cjust redistribution of property\u201d from the haves to the have-nots. But while it\u2019s true that reparations mesh easily with redistribution, it is not a concept which is fundamentally anti-conservative. The idea of the government making amends for its wrongdoing to others has in the past received support from conservatives and conservative parties. This is true especially in the two cases often mentioned by supporters of reparations for Black Americans: The 1953 German reparations to the State of Israel for the Holocaust and the 1988 Civil Liberties Act compensating Japanese Americans for their unjust internment during WWII. It was German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer\u200a\u2014\u200aa deeply devout Catholic who was painfully aware of his country\u2019s moral debt and the leader of an explicitly conservative and free market party\u200a\u2014\u200awho was most responsible for the success of the reparations negotiations between Germany and Israel. While he did rely on left-wing SPD votes to push his not very popular idea through the German Parliament, ultimately it was Adenauer, the conservative Christian, who made sure all hurdles were overcome in the process. The same is true of the reparations for the Japanese. While it\u2019s true that the law was carried by Democratic votes, a large minority of Republicans in the House and a small majority of Republicans in the Senate also voted for a bill. And it was signed into law by conservative hero Ronald Reagan. A second argument asserts that reparations for slavery are unjust since they address something which ended a century and a half ago, when many of the ancestors of America\u2019s current White residents weren\u2019t even on the continent. This argument has some merit when it comes to slavery and individual immigrants and latecomers, but it still has two problems. For a start, reparations would necessarily come from the government, and the American federal and state governments owe a profound moral debt to Black Americans\u200a\u2014\u200anot just for perpetuating and allowing slavery but also for either enforcing the Jim Crow rules or allowing them to exist contrary to the explicit purpose of the 13th-15th amendments to the American Constitution. Second, the later immigrants did not just benefit from the economic jump-start America enjoyed from slavery, but also from the explicitly segregated system in place from 1865 to 1965. This especially includes the entire New Deal system which gave Americans a huge social and financial boost\u200a\u2014\u200aSocial Security, easy loans for good housing, favorable zoning of neighborhoods, grants for higher education (and indeed just education funding in general). Black Americans were shut out of all of this (and in some cases they still are), so even if we accept that later immigrants should not be held accountable for slavery, the demand for reparations is for America\u2019s entire sorry record of legal and extra-legal abuse of their fellow citizens, which directly benefits most of them, and which most did not seriously protest. Whether one supports reparations or not\u200a\u2014\u200athe legacies of slavery and Jim Crow are relevant for America today, not some absurd attempt to claim damages for a wrong deep in the past. But it is here that we run into serious problems. Let\u2019s start with the nature of the reparations claims of 1953 and 1988 compared to reparations demands from Black American groups. The former tended to be quite specific and pinpoint what they were collecting damages for\u200a\u2014\u200aproperty without heirs which would never be reclaimed in the case of the Holocaust, harm to civil liberties for a fixed period in the case of Japanese Americans. The demand for reparations for Black Americans, on the other hand, as expressed by Coates and others, is far more sweeping in nature and extent. It covers the entire period from slavery until the civil rights revolution (at least), covering a panoply of injustices rather than any one specific wrongdoing. Its desired results also strike me as incredibly sweeping\u200a\u2014\u200anot just redress for past wrongs, however calculated, but also an almost cosmic reordering of the country in terms of how Black Americans are treated. By contrast, the Holocaust reparations of 1953 very explicitly ruled out the money serving as \u201cblood money\u201d or somehow atoning for the genocide. It was aimed at concrete recovery of something stolen (though it did lead to further reconciliation; see below). People who advocate reparations for Black Americans, on the other hand, seem to desire something far beyond any sum which the government can pay. It is here that the conservative in me balks. We\u2019ve been here before, sadly. After 1965, enormous sums of federal (and often state) money went into trying to help give Black Americans the hand up they had been denied and to somehow atone for past wrongdoings. The results, at best, have been mixed. In far too many cases, money was simply thrown away. The result was and is often doubly insulting to Black Americans, with more bigoted Whites complaining about \u201ctheir money\u201d being given to \u201cthose people\u201d for nothing and Black Americans wondering what money they\u2019re talking about. It is also difficult to speak of reparations to Black Americans as a whole because Black America is not some monolithic community. As Eugene Robinson describes wonderfully in his book Disintegration, Black Americans are divided into at least four major groups in terms of class and origin, and the idea that some global cash injection or government program will magically help them all in the ways they need (and deserve) help strikes me as wishful thinking, at best. Even more importantly, the comparison to the 1953 reparations which Coates engages in doesn\u2019t work here for a very simple reason\u200a\u2014\u200athat money was used by a majority-Jewish state for the economic benefit of all the Jews residing there, while Black Americans are and will remain a minority in America for the foreseeable future, even in the event White Americans dip to a plurality or even a minority. This means that no sum, however calculated, will magically eliminate the problems and issues of Black Americans as citizens in the United States. It may help somewhat, and there is certainly a good moral case to be made for reparations. But for them to make a real difference, to not just be consolation too-little-too-late chump change of the sort Black families receive for wrongful deaths at the hands of police officers or for the awful defrauding of Black homeowners Coates describes, two other aspects are no less important: Restitution and Reconciliation. If reparations are payments made for damages, restitution is the simple action of giving someone what they were entitled in the first place. Conservatives might balk at the former for all kinds of reasons, but the latter perfectly aligns with basic justice and fairness, and I believe that conservatives should not have a problem getting on board with investing heavily in restitution. What would that entail? For starters, it would require removing the boundaries and obstacles which Black Americans face today\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially discriminatory zoning and discrimination at every level of law enforcement, licensure and occupation laws which disproportionately harm minorities. It is here that we need to face a truth which is fundamentally conservative: There are hard limits on what the federal government can do here. Most of the barriers harming Black Americans are at the local and state levels and it is there that they must be solved. The federal government lacks the manpower and the resources to put out fires everywhere, and it is up to conservatives who so espouse local government and solutions to find ways to solve things at that level. Just removing the boundaries and obstacles which stand in the way of Black Americans would go a long way towards ensuring true restitution. But it is not enough. Black educational institutions have historically been starved of resources and funding, and overcorrecting for this in a way that works is an important part of the story. This is not \u201cwelfare\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s paying back what was denied to Black Americans for generations in the interest of keeping them poor and ignorant. To ensure that both reparation and/or restitution are successful\u200a\u2014\u200aindeed, that they get off the ground\u200a\u2014\u200awe need to talk about the third side of the triangle: Reconciliation. After the Holocaust, the west has told itself a beautiful fairy tale: The west woke up, understood the horror of racism and bigotry, and fully admitted the depth of its complicity in one of the most horrible crimes committed by \u201cwestern civilization.\u201d The truth is far more complicated. Monetary reparations in 1953 or afterwards did not automatically lead to sweeping changes in attitudes towards Jews. Germany itself, the country most committed to reconciliation after WWII, took decades to admit that it was not just some small band of criminals that was complicit in the crime, and that large swathes of German society and the army knew and benefited far more than they admitted at the time. Many countries and peoples occupied by the Germans denied any real complicity in helping murder Jews, and even often resisted convicting just those directly responsible for deporting Jews to the death camps. Holocaust denial continues to flourish decades after the last of the 1953 reparations was paid. Reconciliation was and is a painful, contradictory process which will probably never be finished. Some scars are too deep. Anyone expecting some magical racial reconciliation in the wake of reparations is headed for similarly serious disappointment. We need to be far more honest and realistic about this, understanding that it will take generations of work and good faith to repair the wounds. In a democracy, it is changes in attitudes which help lead to change in policy more than anything else, and this will be the hardest and most necessary aspect of the entire project. Conservatives have an important role to play here, and not just because making the issue bipartisan can ensure success. Through faith, through our reverence for the past, through our own belief in the limited but very real possibility of human virtue and correction, we can help provide insights, temper unrealistic expectations, and show how slow but sure change will help alongside whatever leaps are necessary (such as 1965). More importantly, we can show that coping with the dark past does not mean that America does not deserve a future, or that accepting the hard facts means we must agree with every remedy the left proposes. We can help work together to create a common ground on which to debate and engage\u200a\u2014\u200anot just with Democrats in general but most importantly with Black Americans themselves, who are after all the subject of this story. And perhaps more than anything, we can help hone and refine and recreate that most necessary of antidotes to bigotry: The principle of human moral equality, in its most profound sense.

After all, you thought of it. However, determining if your product or service is actually something your audience wants and needs is critical to your success as an entrepreneur. As we developed the HBX course Entrepreneurship Essentials, we asked the case protagonists featured in the course\u200a\u2014\u200athe entrepreneurs and investors interviewed\u200a\u2014\u200awhat advice they have for aspiring entrepreneurs. Here\u2019s what they had to say. John Osher, a serial entrepreneur behind the SpinBrush toothbrush and many other successful consumer products, highlights that entrepreneurs need to relentlessly seek the truth about their ideas. Osher points out that willful blindness to negative feedback from customers can lead to costly mistakes. Osher explains that the most important thing as an entrepreneur is finding and listening to the truth, no matter how hard it may be. You may think a product is a hit until you put it on the shelf and consumers tell you otherwise. It\u2019s much easier to accept the truth in the beginning stages before you have a total emotional investment in the product or service and you are out of financial resources. \u201cIf an entrepreneur puts truth first, they will always find a way to solve the problem,\u201d Osher explains. \u201cPutting your personal feelings and passion for the product ahead of the truth is a recipe for failure.\u201d Openness to feedback from customers can not only prevent entrepreneurs from leading their ventures astray but it will also guide them to unforeseen opportunities. Scott Cook, co-founder and chairman of Intuit, explains this lesson from a critical moment when his company was in the development stage of the company\u2019s Quicken bookkeeping software. Cook also highlights a key theme in Entrepreneurship Essentials\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cthe power of structured experimentation to guide new ventures.\u201d Cook explains that Quicken was built as a consumer product for personal finance. What they didn\u2019t realize was that their customers were actually using it for their business rather than their personal finances. By listening to its customers, Intuit identified a much bigger opportunity. We said, \u201cWait a minute, there\u2019s a giant market of businesses who need the kind of thing we built, but we just never built it for business,\u201d Cook said. \u201cSo that\u2019s why we run experiments, and run them early, so we can get those surprises early and see the things you only can see when you run an experiment to learn.\u201d It\u2019s critical to listen when the market is trying to speak to you. Jenn Hyman, co-founder and CEO of Rent the Runway, developed a service for customers to rent high fashion clothing and accessories at a much more accessible price point than purchasing them outright. The venture\u2019s business model challenged the status quo for designers. Many said \u201cno\u201d to working with Rent the Runway. For Hyman, \u201cno\u201d became the start of helpful conversations. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the word \u2018no,\u2019\u201d says Hyman. \u201cTo me, \u2018no\u2019 does not mean no; it means no for now.\u201d By viewing \u2018no\u2019 as an invitation for a conversation, you just might turn the no into a yes. But if you never achieve a \u2018yes,\u2019 you still at least learn why they said no, which can be equally as valuable. It takes time for a new concept to receive wide acceptance, and Rent the Runway\u2019s business model is no exception. The concept of renting vs. buying dresses hadn\u2019t been introduced yet, so it was met with initial skepticism. However, once designers took a chance on the model, they saw its potential. By being open to understanding why designers were apprehensive and then adapting the model to fit a designer\u2019s needs, Hyman was able to sell in her idea and gain widespread adoption. Osher, Cook, and Hyman all highlight the critical importance of listening to external feedback to fuel their understanding of opportunities they were pursuing. Jennifer Fonstad, founding partner of venture capital firm Aspect Ventures, encourages the early-stage ventures she works with to bring a mindset of openness to internal hiring as well. By hiring colleagues with differing perspectives, you foster new ways of thinking that can aid your business. As Fonstad explains, \u201cThose who embrace being challenged and those who embrace different perspectives tend to be more successful and make better decisions over time. So we encourage teams to think about how to bring in those different voices, whether it be through your employees and your co-founders, or whether you bring it in through your finance partners or your other board members.\u201d Beyond hiring for skills and perspective that complement an existing team, Abe Ankumah, co-founder and CEO of IT operations firm Nyansa, highlights the importance of a builder mentality in hiring for a startup team member. You try to find old classmates who you have worked with and trust and those who know how to work. At some point you will run out of these personal contacts and you will need to look for ones who can join your team. You must find the right culture for your team. Startups need to look for a certain type of personality\u200a\u2014\u200athose who roll up their sleeves ready to build, versus those who want to join an established company, as Ankumah explains: \u201cYou want to find people who want to build the next Google to make it Google, versus people who want to join Google because it\u2019s already Google.\u201d Learning from others is central to the HBX learning experience, and the individuals represented here are just some of the many protagonists and experts featured in HBX online courses. As in the Harvard Business School classroom, participants of HBX courses dive into a case study of a real world company and together with a cohort of peers from around the world, they master essential business concepts. HBX currently offers a 4-week course, Entrepreneurship Essentials, where participants master a proven framework for building and financing new ventures and learn to speak the language of the startup world.

Typically the people doing this work at startup companies looking to disrupt existing industries. They have dealt with a problem for a long time and they have dreamed of a solution which fixes it. And once you have found them, how can you help them in pursuit of their mission? The mechanisms for accumulating wealth in this system are more clear. The earliest employees in any startup are typically awarded equity in the venture. This is often in recognition of the difficulty the business will face in achieving its dreams and acts as an incentive for these people to commit for a long period of time and work incredibly hard\u200a\u2014\u200aoptions typically vest over a period of 3\u20134 years. As an incentive this is incredibly powerful. As a reward things become less certain. In the analogue world, those problems cloud the certainty of participation. They make doing so worrisome and can inject tremendous amounts of stress and strain into relationships. I want to work on the most innovative products in the world, but they are hard to find and they have no reputation to provide any fraction of certainty that the time you spend will be worthwhile or you will be rewarded as promised. I\u2019d love to work for equity, particularly as a side hustle, but there is nowhere I would trust that my equity would ever be received. That could be changing. Dogezer is a platform which integrates all of the necessary tools for people to work together on innovative projects, with the ability to use project-specific tokens to reward results and incentivise collaboration. Dogezer allows you to get it done together with the experts from around the world by paying them with tokens and shares inyour company.

This isn\u2019t a speculative gamble on a company that might not produce anything. This is an existing product which has support and advise from some of the most knowledgeable and influential individuals in the space. Dogezer aims to bring a different sort of organisation for ICOs\u200a\u2014\u200amaking them fairer, more predictable and under control. That is something I believe the market needs and is a company ethos I trust. In the same way you will be able to participate and influence the development of startups and services on the platform, you will do the same for Dogezer itself. Everyone will be able to join the project and develop additional features for it, and be rewarded from future revenue of the platform. Effectively this means you can become one of the cofounders and possess the same influence on the future of the platform as those who have created it to this point.

My greatest luck was being born into a family that was loving and supportive. I never felt that I was restricted by gender, but rather that I could accomplish anything. I always felt supported and loved. These are profound gifts leading to self confidence that parents can give in ways that no one else can.\u201d Yitzi: Can you share the funniest or most interesting story that occurred to you in the course of your career? \u201cOne of my most interestings mornings was during my time as ambassador when I hosted Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor and author.

How have you used your success to bring goodness to the world? Yes, We have been helping to raise funds to support victims of the recent and devastating wine country fires in Northern California by making a pledge to match donations. It has been heartwarming to see the outpouring of support from all over the Country. We have helped raised approximately $500,000. Yitzi: Wow! Can you tell me a story about a person who was impacted by your cause? We donated 261 rooms total at SENZA Hotel for those displaced by fires. Of that, approximately 20 were first responders from outside of the area needing to rest up to help aid in the relief.

With only a few meters of steep climbing to go, Daly reached a rock where he could not place any protection. Not a big deal for someone with his experience. Well\u2026 not this time. Daly began to fall.\u00a0In a few seconds, he fell more than hundred-feet down the mountain. He bounced and eventually collided with his partner.\u00a0But it wasn\u2019t over. He kept falling. 20 meters more. Daly cratered into the mountainside. Incredibly, the two remaining strands of cord, less than two millimeters thick, didn\u2019t break. At this point, he lost consciousness. When he regained consciousness a few minutes later, he could feel blood dripping from his scalp. He looked down and saw his feet flopping around, devastated by compound fractures. Useless. Meanwhile, Donini had descended to Daly. They soon realized that any movement could severely impact Daly\u2019s condition and pose a threat to his life. Therefore, they decided that Donini would descend further and seek help. Daly had no clue if he could get rescued at all and how long it would take. Nevertheless, he didn\u2019t fall into despair: he had prepared with thousands of hours of disciplined training. He had prepared psychologically as well, planning for different scenarios and reading survival literature to be ready in case of life-threatening events. Daly made what he later described as a decision to live. To avoid hypothermia, he began to exercise as follows: 100 windmills on one arm, then 100 on the other arm; then 100 stomach crunches. Repeat. Keeping his mind focused: counting precisely to 100. When he couldn\u2019t reach 100, he lowered the rhythm first to 50, then 20. Always with rigorous pace. Daly had the mental and physical strength to keep this up for 44 hours, when a rescue pilot hanging from a helicopter grabbed him out of the cold embrace of the mountain. Speaking about this experience, Daly later reflected: Seems easy, huh? We all know, it\u2019s not. Because it requires the ability to screen and control what\u2019s going on in the mind, to an extent that few of us have ever learned or practiced. It requires the mind of a Zen Master. Or Yoda. Or some other larger-than-life character. Doesn\u2019t it? Maybe. But isn\u2019t it something we can all learn?Sure, it requires practice. A lot of it. Our thought-manufacturing machine is continuously busy with worries, goals, comparisons, judgments, stress and the likes. A lot of \u201cfood for thoughts\u201d which keeps the ego at work. With little breaks and lots of overtime. And well beyond the level it needs to serve us in positive and creative ways. We all know that our brain is hardwired to worry and to depict worst case scenarios. It\u2019s a survival endowment. When living in the wild, we had to read every single signal of potential danger AS IF the threat was real.\u00a0We could not afford to underestimate the risk of becoming food for predators. But we\u2019re over this time, aren\u2019t we? It\u2019s time for us to turn things around. To consciously cultivate and master our thinking mind in ways that serve our deeper purposes. Some call \u201cmindfulness\u201d the skill of mastering thinking. The art of being present. The ability to separate a thought from the awareness that lies underneath. The recognition that a deliberate life stems from the conscious decision to focus on opportunities to learn, develop and create rather than getting stuck in repetitive negative mental patterns. I guess it doesn\u2019t really matter how we call this ability.The fact of the matter is: it\u2019s time to purposefully steer the vessel of our consciousness through new seas. No, wait\u2026 to new planets.Because this vessel is a spaceship, not a boat.\u00a0It\u2019s the Enterprise, not the Santa Maria. I came across the Daly story through the book \u201cGreat by choice\u201d by Jim Collins, during one of the most challenging periods of my life, 5 years ago. At that time, I had recurring negative thoughts caused by the dramatic outcome of a relationship. I was devastated, I felt betrayed and outraged.\u00a0I could observe my mind lingering continuously on thoughts that were speaking shame, anger, sadness. Although it wasn\u2019t certainly a question of survival, I knew that I needed to keep my head high and stand on my feet. My ability to recover and avoid losing focus on my work, my health and my connections were all under threat. After reading this story in the chapter of the book dedicated to \u201cluck\u201d, more than once I pictured Daly laying on the frozen snow, swirling his arms. Like him, I realized that the negative energies associated with my loss could prove detrimental to my well-being. They would serve no purpose, as the drama had already happened and there wasn\u2019t really much I could do to fix it. Not on the external level. But I could certainly work on my inner state. How? Per Daly\u2019s teaching:Taking those thoughts, and putting them on a shelf. At that time, I had even created a mental film of \u201cgrabbing a thought\u201d \u2013in the shape of a box\u2013 from a table (representing my active consciousness) and gently laying it on a high shelf.One of those shelves right at the top of a cupboard. One of those that would require me to pull my feet up to be able to lay the box onto it. A shelf on which the box would become almost out of reach.\u00a0I didn\u2019t want that box to be on the table again. My recovery process wasn\u2019t easy nor smooth: negative emotions kept coming up for a while, but the \u201ctrick of the box and the shelf\u201d certainly helped me navigate through that tough period.\u00a0Until the day I became a father, a few weeks ago. 5 years later, Daly, the box and the shelf came once again to my mind. On January 18th, my daughter Annaluna was born.It\u2019s been an overwhelming feeling of bliss, connection, fulfillment.I was with her for the entire first hour of her life, waiting for my girlfriend\u2019s C-section surgery to be over. One and a half hours after the birth (double the time I was told it was going to take), the surgeon came out. She said the surgery hadn\u2019t been smooth. Her face was all but reassuring.When I saw my girlfriend a few minutes later, she was pale and trembling on the stretcher. You bet, I began to worry. So that night we had to hold all our joy. The day after, she was recommended to have a transfusion\u2026 something neither of us had ever experienced before. We knew something was not ok. The morning of the following day, I began to hear my brain telling me stories. Dramatic scenarios.What happens if she dies? What if she can\u2019t breastfeed our daughter?What if? What if? What if? At some point, I had a few seconds of still awareness.\u00a0Hey dude, what\u2019s going on here? I was letting my worrisome thoughts take over. I asked myself:\u00a0\u201cIs fear what life asks of me now? Does it serve my purpose?\u201d I resolved that life was rather calling for my attention, empathy and focus.\u00a0For my unconditional love and support to my girlfriend and my newborn daughter. Yes, that was the ask. So, here\u2019s what I decided at that very moment: \u201cI take these thoughts, pack them nicely in the box, and put them on a shelf.\u201d Thankfully, I have learned how to better take control of my thinking patterns through mindfulness, meditation and journaling in the last 3 years.\u00a0All along, I didn\u2019t even have to remind myself of the box & shelf narrative.\u00a0The benefits came with practice. These habits can help in many day-to-day situations in life. They lower average stress levels. They make life more enjoyable. They help you savor the moment and cultivate a mindset of gratitude. However, when the stakes get high, my ability to keep inner peace and manage fear is still being tested.I feel the stretch, but I can keep cool and respond to the challenges in ways that are more effective for me to tackle the cliffs and valleys of life. Yes, I know: I\u2019m lucky. Everything went well in the end: we are happy mother and father. It\u2019s such an immense joy. And you know what?We have a plan for next weekend: install few more shelves in the house.\u00a0At least one more in each room. For some reason, we feel there\u2019s a purpose to it.

How much is your design taking up? As designers, we know our designs should reduce cognitive loads. We\u2019ve heard that good design is invisible design. But why? What is the physiological or psychological reasoning for this? Hard to answer, right? It\u2019ll be much easier to answer once we understand what our working memory is. The working memory is where we learn, where we do math, where we reason. It\u2019s what we use as we\u2019re reading this sentence and when we\u2019re using any app. Essentially, working memory is what processes information, the information that\u2019s stored temporarily in our short term memory and more permanently in our long-term memory. Here\u2019s an example. Close your eyes and do the following equation. Try it, then open your eyes. Short term memory allows you to remember that you need to add 24 and 55. You know how to add because that\u2019s been stored in your long term memory since elementary school. Working memory is when you\u2019re actually doing the operation. But working memory is severely limited. Unlike long term memory, which is unlimited, short term and working memory can only hold and process 4 +/- 1 discrete pieces of info (if you\u2019ve previously heard 7, read the footnotes to learn more). If I changed the operation to 247 + 551, notice how much harder it\u2019s become. If I asked you to close your eyes again, just keeping the numbers in your head is quite difficult. Processing it becomes even harder. And remember, working memory only has ~4 spots! Using the same math example again, let\u2019s say you must remember 247 + 551 because you can\u2019t write it down or refer back to this post. Now pretend I gave you an abacus to do the math problem. Chances are you\u2019ve never used it before, so now remembering your goal of adding 247 + 551 has become much harder because your memory has now been relegated to learn how to use a new tool. That mental anguish, the mental taxation, that\u2019s because all your working memory is at its ~4 capacity. That is cognitive load. A psych term, it literally means the amount of working memory used for a task. Compare using an abacus to using a calculator. A calculator, a tool that you\u2019re familiar with, disappears into the background, so that all your working memory is focused on punching in 247 + 551 instead of figuring out how the tool works. Much less cognitive load. So why should design fall into the background? Literally, it\u2019s because working memory, when focused on its own goal, has less capacity to figure out how to use a tool. With only ~4 capacity storage, it\u2019s a zero sum game. If working memory is focused on the tool, it\u2019s not focused on its goal. If it\u2019s focused on the goal, it has little room for a complex tool. If it wants to focus on both, then we\u2019ll feel a lot more mental fatigue and be more error prone. Recently I\u2019ve been fascinated by our eyes. In another article, I wrote about how 30% of our brain is composed of neurons dedicated to vision and how 90% of transmitted info to the brain is visual. As a matter of fact, our eyes are optical neurons that outgrew from the brain! Our eyes quickly and easily make tremendous sense of the world around us. When things are laid out nicely, our eyes can \u201cunderstand\u201d the page or screen. When a page has good information architecture and visual hierarchy, when buttons and links have good affordances, and when objects follow the Gestalt principles, our eyes can quickly and correctly make sense of a screen. This clears the brain from being involved in the \u201cunderstanding\u201d so more of the working memory can be used to reach its original goals. But when a page has a lot of text, when objects don\u2019t follow the Gestalt principles, when a screen isn\u2019t laid out to be easily understood, that computation has now been passed on from our eyes to our brains. Our brains are more actively required to make sense of the screen, and that increases the cognitive load by using up more of our working memory. So the next time we\u2019re designing, remember that working memory is very limited and precious. Our users should be using all of it to reach their goals, not to understand how to use our tools. Leave the \u201cunderstanding\u201d to our eyes. Or just remember our little experiment: are you designing an abacus or a calculator? Next week I\u2019ll be writing a follow up about how emotions affect our working memory and what that means for our designs. Follow me to be updated! Also, my last article explored our 3 brains and how to design for them. This article was actually a continuation of the last, exploring how to design for our new brain. Footnotes / Further Explanations: If you thought our working memory can hold ~7 pieces of info, that\u2019s from George Miller, who actually said that in a joke. Since then Nelson Cowan has proven that the capacity of our working memory is actually much smaller, holding only ~4 pieces of info. 4 +/- 1 also depends on the person, their knowledge, schemas and expertise. For example, how many of \u201cFBINATOCIANSA\u201d letters can you remember in order? What if I broke it down to FBI NATO CIA NSA? Chances are you can remember all letters in order no problem now. But for a child or a foreigner, breaking down the letters won\u2019t help, because they don\u2019t have this knowledge stored in their long-term memory. Design is the same. Depending on who your users are, they probably already have quite a lot stored in their long-term memory that they can pull from. Designing for millennials who know technology probably better than the back of their hands is very different from designing for users in their 60s, who have difficulties finding the period on the keyboard. I should mention that the ~4 storage capacity aren\u2019t always even being delegated to the user\u2019s goal while they\u2019re using your product. Anything else the user might be doing/thinking or anything from the environment is also vying for those ~4 precious working memory spots. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re using Google Maps. Chances are you\u2019re out in traffic, trying to navigate between cars and pedestrians while paying attention to cyclists and traffic lights. Those are all using up those ~4 working memory spots! And if you\u2019re new to driving. Well, then you\u2019re just f*ed. Working memory overload! By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

Living a largely pre-modern-type live surrounded by modern society, and modern record-keeping, many demographers treat the Amish as a kind of \u201cliving fossil,\u201d that is, a look at \u201cnatural fertility conditions,\u201d that is, fertility conditions without birth control or industrialization. I think that view is mostly wrong, but explaining why is a bit tricky, and getting data on these folks ain\u2019t always easy. So let\u2019s look at the Amish. First of all, how many are there? There are a lot of studies out there that estimate the number of Amish people. Some agree, some disagree, but the differences aren\u2019t huge. I will basically take the estimates of the Amish Studies Center at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania, supplemented by a few other sources on earlier periods, and directly interpolated for missing years. And that folks is an exponential growth curve. You don\u2019t see one of them suckers in the demographic wild every day, and, when you do, it\u2019s usually some kind of new-settlement of virgin country or something\u2026 or a developing country with few mass-catastrophic events. Here\u2019s population growth (spiky because of my linear interpolations): Growth rates have risen and fallen, but there\u2019s no strong time trend here. You may also be wondering, \u201cWith growth rates that high, how long until Amish population doubles?\u201d Weeeeelll\u2026 So a reasonable presumption would be that the Amish population doubles every 15 to 30 years. In other words, every generation is about twice as big as the one before it. This means the average woman must be having at least 4.2 kids assuming no conversions. But if you then assume, as most literature suggests, that about a quarter of Amish youths ultimately leave the church, and that conversions into the Amish lifestyle are very rare, then you arrive at a situation where long-run fertility of the Amish in the 20th century must have been 5.5\u20136.5 children per woman. But do we have any data to pack that up? Heck yes we do! One team of researchers uses Census data to identify women who had completed their fertility years in the 1960, 80, and 90 Censuses and who spoke Pennsylvania Dutch, the distinctive language spoken almost exclusively spoken by Amish people. As a second specification, they narrowed this sample to women who had no phone in their home in the 1980 and 90 censuses. Here are their resulting estimates of completed fertility by birth cohort for Old Order Amish (a subset of the most \u201cplain\u201d Amish), vs some key baselines. I have also included completed fertility rates directly measured in the Amish communities of Geauga, Ohio, by a different team of researchers. That second team uses Amish community records of births to estimate historic birth trends. The most reliable data, the Geauga data, shows completed fertility of over 7 kids per woman for those born in the first half of the 20th century, then a decline. The Census-based data is lower, but still confirms very high fertility, and a decline in the postwar-born generation. Interestingly, simply speaking Pennsylvania Dutch is not a powerful indicator of super-high fertility. It\u2019s Pennsylvania Dutch and lack of a phone that seems to be the really strong indicator of Amish-type fertility. So with that in mind, I did a little digging myself in IPUMS. What are current fertility rates for Pennsylvania Dutch-speaking-women-with-no-phones? The above chart doesn\u2019t show any indicator for Amish women. Instead, it shows some food-for-thought. Rural women already have higher birth rates than women generally, and the Amish are overwhelmingly rural. Another interesting comparison is Hispanic women. Hispanics are classically considered to have higher fertility rates than non-Hispanic women, so it should be interesting to compare them to the Amish. Now then. Let\u2019s add the Amish. We\u2019ll do one line for Pennsylvania Dutch-speakers, and one line for Pennsylvania Dutch-speakers who also have no phone. aaaaand there you have it folks. Fertility is still extremely high among Pennsylvania Dutch speakers, and especially high among those with no phone. We\u2019re talking average TFRs from 2001\u20132015 of about 6 or 7 births per woman. That\u2019s genuinely remarkable, and that doesn\u2019t include twinning. That\u2019s just delivery count. Now here\u2019s a cool trick. The Geauga Amish study was able to give us age-specific fertility rates by birth cohort, which we can reallign into period-specific fertility rates, to get estimated Amish TFRs for a limited number of years. Here\u2019s the result: But those ACS-derived TFRs are so bouncy. Let\u2019s smooth them out by averaging across several years. Now, one last thing. Let\u2019s, just for fun, do a few more adjustments. Let\u2019s assume actual Amish fertility in recent years is the average of our 2 estimators. And let\u2019s assume it\u2019s a contiguous series with the Geauga series. And let\u2019s see if changes in that series mimic changes in U.S. fertility generally. Well, well, well. What have we here. At least in the Geauga, Ohio Amish settlements, the decline in fertility followed national fertility trends very closely. Here\u2019s a fun fact: the Amish don\u2019t use most forms of birth control or abortion. Now, this doesn\u2019t mean Amish fertility fell as low as U.S. general fertility; it simply means that Amish fertility fell as much as U.S. general fertility. In the modern period, we can see that, from the early 1980s to 2000, Amish fertility had actually fallen way more than U.S. TFR on the whole. Then it spiked in the late 2000s, and has fallen since. But let\u2019s zoom in on the 2000s for a second and index both Amish fertility and U.S. TFR to 2001. You seein\u2019 what I\u2019m seein\u2019? Cuz what I\u2019m seein\u2019 is that Amish fertility is pretty well correlated with U.S. TFR on the whole. And no, the Amish are not a big enough population to drive this trend: removing the Amish from the sample doesn\u2019t change U.S. TFR essentially at all. So this is actually very important. See, the Amish are cut off from certain parts of U.S. society (many cultural norms, certain technologies, etc), but they aren\u2019t cut off from others. The Amish have farms and businesses that have to make money, and most Amish consider it morally acceptable to manage the spacing (and to a limited extent even the total number) of childbirths. So the Amish are impacted by the business cycle. I have been strongly on the side saying that the decline in fertility in the U.S. is driven by technological changes (LARCs and emergency contraception) and by cultural changes; that the business cycle is not the primary cause anymore. But the evidence from the Amish suggests otherwise. Even a group that had contraceptive use and cultural norms held roughly constant experienced a similar change in fertility as the U.S. general population. The only thing that they would have been exposed to is economically-transmitted fertility shocks via changes in economic returns from their businesses which sell to non-Amish people. This biases in favor of economic cyclicality driving fertility trends, and against culture. Let\u2019s talk maps. The Amish don\u2019t live everywhere evenly, but are concentrated in certain areas. Here\u2019s a map of adherency to Amish religious bodies, as tracked by the U.S. religion census, as a share of county-level population in 2010: Surprise! The Amish cluster in certain areas, particularly Pennsylvania and Ohio. But if Amish people really have an impact on birth rates\u2026 then these counties should have higher births. Sadly, I can\u2019t get TFRs by county because both CDC and the ACS have extremely limited ability or willingness to share detailed data on small geographies. But I can at least get the crude birth rate. The interesting thing here is that the Amish mostly live in rural places, and rural places mostly have older populations, and so should have lower crude birth rates. The chart below shows the average percent difference in crude birth rates for counties vs. the state they are in by the Amish share of the population. In other words, for the 4 counties in Ohio with 5% Amish or more, I take the difference between their crude birth rates and Ohio\u2019s statewide crude birth rate, to get a residual birth rate. I then take all the county-level residual birth rates for counties with at least 5% Amish, and average them. It\u2019s a crude method, but it shows some pretty huge effects. Counties where 15% or more of the population is Amish have, on average, 10 to 65% higher crude birth rates than the state on the whole. There\u2019s some change over time, with the Amish becoming more distinctive, but it\u2019s not a huge change. Because we\u2019re dealing with a relatively small number of counties, the range on these estimates is pretty wide, so the 5% and 10% group can\u2019t necessarily reject 0 effect. But it is striking to me that each rank higher you go, the higher the crude birth rate residual gets. Let\u2019s do this scatterplot style. We\u2019ll take the average crude birth rate residual by county from 2000 to 2016, and graph it vs. 2010 estimated Amish share. It\u2019s not a perfect fit. But it does seem to be the case that, especially when Amish share is very high, birth rates really do rise. It\u2019s worth noting that Lancaster County, Pennsylvania (the big dot at 5% Amish and 20% birth residual) actually is large enough for CDC to provide a general fertility rate estimate for it: and it\u2019s the highest GFR in Pennsylvania. I can get an ACS-based TFR estimate for Wayne County, Ohio the largish dot just about the line at about 8% Amish share. The TFR there is about 2.2\u20133 for the whole county depending on the year, way higher than the Ohio average. Geauga county is too small for me to get data on, and I\u2019m perplexed why it doesn\u2019t do better, and indeed seems to have a low birth rate. But that may simply reflect that the other 90% of the county\u2019s population blows Amish reproductive trends out of the water. Are the Amish going to overtake America? The answer is probably no. Amish fertility, while vastly higher than the U.S. on the whole, does seem to be declining somewhat. And even if Amish population growth continued at current trends, it would still take them over 200 years more to make up 100% of American population, barring some non-Amish population collapse. Exponential growth is a powerful thing, but the Amish are starting from a very low base. But even so, Amish fertility offers some fascinating insights. First of all, it\u2019s more responsive to wider social trends than we might expect, suggesting that they may not be experiencing truly \u201cnatural fertility conditions.\u201d Amish society, far from a living fossil, exists in a dynamic relationship with the wider economy. There\u2019s been a gradual shift among the Amish increasingly away from traditional farming, towards manufacturing, like furniture, in no small part driven by profit-signals from the non-Amish economy. Finally, while the Amish example suggests that the economy may be the driving force in current fertility declines\u2026 they nonetheless show the importance of culture in determining fertility trends. Voluntary choices by even fairly modest numbers of people (there are under 400,000 Amish people in America) can have impacts large enough to show up in national-level surveys. Minute-scale subcultures can be demographically significant. And while culture and technology might not be the cause of the current fertility decline, it\u2019s quite possible one or both could be part of the solution.

Gordon (this piece was originally published on May 24, 2017) \u201cWe lived as usual, by ignoring. Ignoring isn\u2019t the same as ignorance, you have to work at it.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aMargaret Atwood, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale \u201cI get how it can be news to some of you that people are victimized by systems legitimated by your nation, countrymen, and god. But I\u2019m black and female and southern. I call that Tuesday.\u201d \u2013Tressie McMillan Cottom (This essay contains spoilers up to Season 1, Episode 7 of Hulu\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale) 1 I first read Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale in college for a class on feminist writers. From the very first paragraph, the novel was overpowering for me as a black, gay man; Atwood\u2019s novel is about many things, but what struck me most was one theme, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been able to articulate it fully until now: The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is about an American white woman \u201cnigger-ed\u201d by the society that has betrayed her. The most obvious take on the book, of course, is that Offred is dealing with a sexist, patriarchal society run amok. But Offred also wakes up to a changed world and has to negotiate \u201cwhiteness\u201d for the first time in her life, and I empathized with her because, at the university campus I attended, I was negotiating a fair amount of whiteness myself. What gripped me about the book, which I believe couldn\u2019t have been achieved as effectively through the third person, was the way Atwood chose to render the story; Offred\u2019s tale reads like a slave narrative. The book is often compared, as a dystopia, with Orwell\u2019s 1984, or Anthony Burgess\u2019 A Clockwork Orange, but it is also Narrative of the Life of Fredrick Douglass, Ellison\u2019s Invisible Man. The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is about the black experience in America as told by a white woman. In what was once the United States, now the Republic of Gilead, a reasonably privileged, educated, married, heterosexual white woman now has to negotiate her life as an enslaved black: she is forced to pick up nuances of tone and respond to the whims of personality of the \u201cwhite folks\u201d around her, her \u201cmasters\u201d, the people who own her. Her every moment is circumscribed, she is forbidden to read or write. She even loses her name, the definitive characteristic of the slave experience. She becomes Offred\u200a\u2014\u200aOf Fred, the commander to whose home she is sent on reproductive assignment, and where she is raped with the authority and sanction of the State. If she doesn\u2019t give birth and is still fertile, she may be reassigned to a different post, where she will then be Ofmark or Ofjohn. The baby, when she gives birth, will be taken from her after she nurses it. Her womb is the property of Gilead. And while we may see the parallels to a black woman\u2019s children being sold during slavery, we are often unable to comprehend the full horror of that historic violation because of the mythology that still prevails about black women\u2019s sexuality, and our inability to have an honest national conversation about slavery in this country. Through The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, however, we are appalled in a quite different way when the women whose children are taken from them are blonde, educated, and named Laura, Becky, Susan, Michelle, June\u200a\u2014\u200aprofessional women, women with their own children, their own homes, money, and power. The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is Miss Ann cast as a slave. In some ways, this is an unfair assessment: Offred, as written by Atwood, hardly feels like a Miss Ann. She has a sensitive voice we trust immediately through her observations, and she is as mystified by the society she finds herself in as we are. I am also aware that I need to be careful here: I have never lived as a woman, white or black, in a sexist society. But if Offred\u2019s experience is about sexism, it is also decidedly about race; which is why a courageous exploration of whiteness is essential to adapting the novel. This is also why there may still be a twinge of revenge fantasy in the story for some readers of color: Offred, in her comfortable white America, is probably a Democrat, but there is no suggestion that she is an activist, or political, unlike her feminist mother. In the book, Offred admits to not attending a protest march because \u201cLuke said it would be futile and I had to think about my family, him and her.\u201d A confrontation about feminist politics between Offred, her husband and her mother, recalled in a flashback, is a highlight of the book. (Offred\u2019s mother, exasperated by her daughter for taking equal rights for granted, represents the \u201ccynical left\u201d.) Certain readers, while deeply moved by Offred\u2019s tragedy, may also feel like saying to her, \u201cWe tried to tell you these right-wing white people were crazy, but you didn\u2019t want to listen or fight back when you were comfortable\u200a\u2014\u200awhen society worked for you\u200a\u2014\u200aand now it is too late.\u201d (A sentiment shared by more than a few people I know on November 9, the day after Hillary Clinton lost.) For this reason, I would argue that \u201cblackness\u201d is inherent in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, regardless of who is cast. And while on one level I admire the decision to blind cast for greater diversity in Hulu\u2019s televised production, it does bring up fascinating questions for the viewer, and diminishes some of the novel\u2019s comments on race, patriarchy and white supremacy. 2 Executive producer and writer Bruce Miller was quoted as saying in defense of the casting, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between making a show about racists and making a racist show?\u201d Miller has a point, but color-blind casting The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, unlike like Shakespeare in the Park, may be like color-blind casting 12 Years A Slave. It is the show\u2019s conceit, for example, that Offred is now in an interracial marriage, with a daughter of color, when she and her husband Luke are attempting to escape over the Canadian border. Her best friend Moira, who joins her at the Red Center where the women are reprogrammed and prepared for their fate as Handmaids, remains gay, but is also re-imagined as black. In the novel, Offred is aware that her husband has been shot, but only able to speculate about whether he is dead or alive. In the televised series she reveals that he was shot, and her answer seems decisive, final. (In episode 6, we find out he\u2019s alive.) This may seem like a small difference, but it is a difference that matters as it relates to the \u201cblack\u201d experience: it is Offred\u2019s constant \u201cnot-knowing\u201d that sets the tone of much of her story, the melancholy devastation which defines the book. Part of Offred\u2019s \u201cmiddle passage\u201d into the slavery of Gilead, and the heartbreak of memory, is that she doesn\u2019t know exactly what has happened to her or the people she loves. She has been removed from her life mid-sentence, she knows she has been given electric shock, and has possibly been drugged, and she is forced to wonder whether her husband, her mother and her daughter are still alive. This dislocation is not dissimilar to the way the reader is thrust into the world of slavery in Toni Morrison\u2019s novel Beloved. (I remember a bronze memorial sculpture by Karl Biedermann I saw in a square in Berlin, of a table with one chair pushed in, the other overturned, called Der Verlassene Raum\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Abandoned Room. No film on the Holocaust that I\u2019ve ever seen, no documentary, affected me the way this piece of art did, or terrified me in quite the same way. I understood something about encountering evil in that moment, the suggestion of how a life can be interrupted, the things that are never resolved.) Regrettably, the series also decides at the end of the first episode to stray from the book and have Offred say, straight to the viewer, \u201cMy name is June.\u201d Later in the series after she reveals her name in exasperation, a character says, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, June.\u201d While this may seem like an act of defiance or modern-day liberation, readers of the novel are forced to imagine what Offred\u2019s actual name is throughout the book (though some may feel there are hints, her name is never confirmed). This anonymity gives her experience another level of horror and anguish and relates to the erasure of her identity and history: we have a deep intimacy with the character, but on some level we never know her and we never will. Offred, nameless in the book, becomes legion: she may be your sister, your neighbor, a woman you knew at work. Atwood could easily have given us Offred\u2019s real name in a flashback, a line of dialogue, but Offred is an \u201cInvisible Woman\u201d. If she doesn\u2019t perform her duties, she can easily be replaced by another woman who will become the new \u201cOffred\u201d. When she finds out that her predecessor, also Offred (who leaves behind the message \u201cNolite te bastardes carorundorum\u201d), killed herself, we mourn the woman\u2019s death, but we never know who she was\u200a\u2014\u200ashe too remains nameless. There is a crucial scene in the series in which Offred finds out that her bank account has been frozen, and that she is no longer able to take care of herself without her husband\u2019s help. The society she has known is crumbling, and she is at home, plotting her next move with her husband and best friend\u200a\u2014\u200aboth black. It is a credit to the actors that this scene works at all: it becomes a very different encounter with two black Americans sitting at that table. Watching it, I recalled the reactions of astonishment when Donald Trump was elected\u200a\u2014\u200athere were my friends who \u201cjust couldn\u2019t believe it\u201d and those, usually of color, who felt a wary cynicism that never wavered after the election of George W. Bush, and saw it coming. This is a bit too simplistic along racial lines, and there are exceptions, of course, but Luke and Moira, cast as black Americans, would have a more nuanced reaction to Gilead than the script gives them. An inspired screenwriter would appreciate what they would say to Offred, who, on a certain level, even with a black husband, might be losing her innocence about what her white countrymen and -women are truly capable of. Samira Wiley gives a riveting performance as Moira, the rebel force who inspires Offred because of her courage to fight and stay alive. The anger and survival instinct in Wiley\u2019s work achieve what black actors have done for decades in films: there are shadings in her performance that suggest a greater experience of blackness than what is in the writing. We see from Wiley\u2019s face that this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s dealt with \u201cGilead\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athe only difference is degree. But an unfortunate scene in which Offred and Moira escape from the Red Center, an act which could cost them their lives, has all the suspense of two high school students skipping fourth period biology together. Moira and Offred overpower one of the \u201cAunts\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athe overseers who train the Handmaids and keep them enslaved. Moira steals the Aunt\u2019s outfit, Offred is dressed in her red Handmaid\u2019s garb, and together they leave the Red Center and hit the streets. This crucial scene is not given any racial context, and it absolutely needs one. The color-blind casting fails spectacularly here. While we see a few black Handmaids in the Red Center, we haven\u2019t yet seen any black women in authority, no black \u201cAunts\u201d. It is not impossible that Gilead would have some black Handmaids and Aunts\u200a\u2014\u200aa white supremacist society might have black commanders who need babies too, and there is certainly a comment to be made about patriarchy, racism, and black complicity. But we need more than just a few black faces scattered on the screen for a production to be \u201cdiverse\u201d. Blind casting is truly \u201cblind\u201d in a production like this, if they just take a white actor out and put a black one in, without adjusting the script to reflect \u201cthe black experience\u201d. We need to see one of the men confront Moira\u2019s \u201cAunt\u201d when she passes, and for her to reduce him, as only an Aunt could; we need to see how this black woman can imitate white entitlement and religious fervor when her life depends on it. We need to imagine the experiences that would inform a black Moira: the \u201cAunt\u201d she imitates may be based on a racist teacher, or a woman her grandmother once worked for as a maid. There are no bad performances in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, and yet something feels off in the conception. Ann Dowd is terrifying as Aunt Lydia, but her casting feels a bit offensive. Dowd, as presented here, is a large, \u201cmasculine\u201d woman\u200a\u2014\u200athe Incredible Hulk as a Quaker. When she takes her anger out on the Handmaids she is like the outcast in high school, the girl who is always reading and can\u2019t get a date, torturing the cheerleaders because they are more popular than she is. I\u2019d find this role much more interesting if it were played by Michelle Pfeiffer or, even better, Katie Couric. When I first read the book in the Nineties, I imagined Sandy Duncan. (Aunt Lydia, as written by Atwood, is described as a beseeching woman with rodent-like teeth, given to sentimentality, who \u201ctwinkles\u201d and is of \u201cgood cheer\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aa team player, a company woman.) The TV character, on the other hand, looks as if she may be someone\u2019s stereotype of a gay woman, which might be a commentary of a different kind. Dowd as Aunt Lydia is presented, without make-up, as a big, \u201cunfeminine\u201d woman. She\u2019s scary as hell, but a little too easy for audiences to hate\u200a\u2014\u200aDowd stands outside a certain kind of white female archetype, and she isn\u2019t the actress to subvert it. And this is basically the problem: Atwood\u2019s book, with few exceptions, doesn\u2019t resist examining whiteness, but the series does, or just doesn\u2019t go far enough. This is the second attempt at filming the novel, and while it is, at times, the superior effort, I dream of a filmmaker who goes all the way in, and isn\u2019t afraid to cast \u201cwhite\u201d-white women, white women we love, in the evil roles. (I remember the devastation TV audiences of Roots felt when Robert Reed, the beloved father from The Brady Bunch, sold Kissy Kinte to another plantation for learning to read and write.) Australian actress Yvonne Strahovski is a much younger, more appealing Serena Joy than in the novel. The character is so beautiful that at times she looks as if she has stepped out of an oil painting\u200a\u2014\u200ahardly the woman who puts out her cigarette \u201cdecisively, one jab and one grind, not the series of genteel taps favored by many of the Wives\u201d, as Offred describes in the book. Serena Joy in the novel is wrecked, and angry, and from this one detail, one imagines, capable of great violence. (This is a character with whom one could start a conversation about American slavery!) Strahovski is compelling, but her Serena Joy says something very different about racism and white supremacy in America than if the character were played by Reese Witherspoon. Witherspoon in comedy, when she\u2019s in the right vehicle, has a gift for revealing the shadow side of the American dream and white womanhood. She\u2019s not afraid to show the insanity of what it means to be an American \u201cgirl\u201d, the rage behind having to be \u201cperky\u201d. (Consider Reese Witherspoon as Martha Stewart as Serena Joy!) In episode six of The Handmaid\u2019 Tale, \u201cA Woman\u2019s Place\u201d, we delve into Serena Joy\u2019s past and discover that she has led the movement that helped create Gilead; through her books and speeches, she\u2019s helped encourage women to accept their second-class status. Strahovski\u2019s Serena Joy may recall singer Elizabeth Schwarzkopf during Nazi rule, but, unlike Schwarzkopf, Serena isn\u2019t allowed to \u201csing\u201d anymore; minutes before she is to give a speech during Gilead\u2019s transition, she is told by her husband that it has been cancelled. The implication is that, despite her higher rank, on some level Serena Joy is as oppressed as Offred (In Gilead, she\u2019s forced to wear teal dresses only and give dinner parties). We don\u2019t get any scenes, however, of Serena Joy on \u201cThe View\u201d or \u201cGood Morning, America\u201d or \u201cFox News\u201d, rallying the sexist troops, we don\u2019t sense that she loved her career, and hadn\u2019t anticipated what Gilead would personally cost her. As she\u2019s written and played, she seems as depressed in the flashbacks as she is in the present. She\u2019s definitely no Ann Coulter, as some reviewers have suggested. In fact, The Handmaid Tale ladles on so much empathy for Serena Joy that, at times, she seems more bewildered than Offred is. A friend of mine and I played a game, imagining women we would cast in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale from any era, Debbie Reynolds or Doris Day as Serena Joy, Meg Ryan or Jennifer Aniston as Aunt Lydia. With these \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts\u201d and \u201cAll-American Girls\u201d in the roles as conceived in the novel, we would be forced to explore whiteness and racial violence in ways that would make us all squirm. Because if our whitest icons are exposed and found not to be white, if we finally tell the truth about Scarlett O\u2019Hara, then we may find out that America isn\u2019t white anymore, that it never was. And with the destruction of the myth of American white womanhood, with the acknowledgment that we\u2019re all human, all American, comes the more difficult conversation\u200a\u2014\u200ahow much do you pay the black woman (or her descendants) who raised your children for free for hundreds of years at the expense and sacrifice of her own? 3 Many readers of a book like The Handmaid\u2019s Tale feel protective, and fear that filmmakers are going to \u201cruin\u201d it. It is impossible to avoid this apprehension when the book is a fan favorite, when it cuts so emotionally deep. Atwood\u2019s novel floods the imagination. And I respect why bringing the novel\u2019s flashbacks into 2016, with references to Uber and Tinder, can make the story more present for women and men of a younger generation, and why color-blind casting may seem the more progressive choice. But inevitably other significant details are lost: Offred recalls when first meeting Serena Joy, for example, that she has seen her before on a Sunday morning gospel program that she would watch as a child before her mother woke. This locates Offred in a time before cable and television offered a thousand options, when there were only a handful of channels to choose from\u200a\u2014\u200aI remember those Sunday mornings, I remember watching those programs. I also remember pressing my hand, \u201cPoltergeist\u201d style, against the television screen when a TV preacher said something about letting Jesus into my heart. While the TV evangelist, via the 700 Club and Tammy Faye Baker, may be a dated cultural reference, I can imagine an updated Offred who has seen Serena Joy on CNN defending prayer in school (Kellyann Conway as the Commander\u2019s wife.) The critical implication here, which is missing from the series, is that the brainwashing of Offred began early. In the novel, as Luke is preparing dinner, Offred\u2019s feminist mother says, \u201cLook at him, slicing up the carrots. Don\u2019t you know how many lives, how many women\u2019s bodies, the tanks had to roll over just to get that far?\u201d Luke responds that cooking is his hobby. In the series we lose an opportunity to appreciate how powerless her mother feels, trying to explain to her daughter what she has spent her life fighting for, and the motivation that she feels to smash Luke\u2019s white male privilege and smugness. This scene simply cannot be played the same way with a black man in the role. (And Offred\u2019s mother is sorely missed as a character; in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale there are no heroic women in the series over the age of thirty.) In \u201cA Woman\u2019s Place\u201d, a female Mexican ambassador visits Gilead to participate in a trade deal. Offred thinks the deal is about oranges, only to find out they are trading Handmaids as sex slaves. During an elaborate dinner given in the ambassador\u2019s honor, the children of Gilead, the fruits of the Handmaid\u2019s labors, are trotted out, Halloween-pageant-style, for all to see: black girls in braids frolic with white boys with blue eyes and blonde hair. (\u201cRacist\u201d Gilead has more diversity than most pre-K schools on New York\u2019s Upper East Side.) When the ambassador first asks her about life in Gilead, Offred lies to her in front of others, but in a final scene when she gives her a gift of Mexican chocolates, Offred reveals that she is miserable, that her daughter has been taken and that she herself has been raped and tortured. In this moment, the irony is not lost that Offred has to ask a woman of color, a foreigner in power, for help. (This scene isn\u2019t in the book.) But when the woman refuses her, Offred steps right up to her face and asks how she can trade women for \u201cfucking\u201d chocolate. In moments like these, Offred gets to be \u201cwhite\u201d again, and The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, despite Elizabeth Moss\u2019 strong performance, becomes ridiculous. Sassy slaves are usually whipped or sold\u200a\u2014\u200aOffred gets to tell off world leaders and keep her chocolates. It is becoming increasingly clear after watching the last episode of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale that the creators have envisioned the production less as a one-time \u201cevent\u201d and more as a series that will run for several seasons. If so, this seems profoundly misguided: Gilead envisioned as a place to which viewers will want to return weekly like Thornton Wilder\u2019s Our Town. This must be a business decision rather than an aesthetic one meant to honor the book. Can\u2019t the showrunners see that the claustrophobia of Offred\u2019s daily reality is the key to her story, that part of her testimony is revealed to us through dissociation, and that her will to escape through her mind becomes a powerful comment on how one survives recurring sexual abuse? That brevity is essential to the book\u2019s harrowing effect? By \u201copening out\u201d the narrative and giving Luke his own episode in \u201cThe Other Side\u201d, the story is finally extended into hopeless contrivance: Luke, having been shot, is then taken away in an ambulance, which then overturns, killing the Guardians inside so that he is free to escape. (We later discover that other dissenters are hanged from church rafters, but Luke gets an ambulance to rush him to the hospital; in Gilead, clearly, Black Lives Matter.) Luke, action-figure hero, then meets a traveling group of escapees from TV Screenwriting 101: a blonde woman mute from trauma, a friendly black nun, a gay man, and their feisty white ringleader, an army brat called Zoe. When Luke insists that they pull their van over so that he can get back to Boston to save his family, Zoe gets her inner \u201cHarriet Tubman\u201d on and pulls a gun on him to save his life. We are then flashed forward three years and discover that Luke lives in a section of Canada called \u201cLittle America\u201d (Toronto) and that he is friends with the mute woman. She still doesn\u2019t speak, but can roll her eyes when he informs her the \u201ccoffee\u201d he hands her is really tea because of rationing. (In dystopic societies, Starbucks is the first thing to go.) It was at this precise moment that I began to despise Hulu\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. An even bigger mystery than who will save Offred from Gilead: who will save Atwood\u2019s novel from Bruce Miller? 4 I was a huge fan of Downton Abbey in its first three seasons, and was interested, and more than a little skeptical, when it was announced that they were to introduce a black character in Season 4. I am usually very sensitive to the absence of diversity on a television show\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is one of the reasons I have never watched more than a handful of episodes of Friends, and can\u2019t bring myself to watch anything by Woody Allen anymore. But surprisingly, I didn\u2019t require a black face on Downton, and when I got it, was bewildered. The character they came up with, an American jazz musician named Jack Ross, based on an historical figure, who has an affair with Lady Rose Aldridge, was unoffensive, I suppose, but the character didn\u2019t tell me much about being black, or being American, or about jazz, or much of anything else. Part of the problem was that, while the show did allow a few sour glances in Jack\u2019s direction, I knew that Downton Abbey wasn\u2019t prepared to show us how Lord and Lady Grantham would really react to an interracial romance between their aristocratic white relation and a black American in 1920s England. I knew they weren\u2019t prepared to damage the Downton brand, to destroy the feeling on the show that sometimes permits viewers to think, \u201cI wish I could have been a lady\u2019s maid or valet in England\u201d, or to make the characters we\u2019ve come to love over the years unlikeable by showing them as historically accurate (read racist.) So, while I was glad a black actor had a job, I remember wishing that if they couldn\u2019t be honest about the plot line, they should have just left it alone. Downton Abbey, however, was in a different position from The Handmaid\u2019s Tale (by the time that black character arrived at Downton, the show had so many other challenges to credibility that an unbelievable black character was the least of their problems). TheHandmaid\u2019s Tale is about a totalitarian society controlled by the religious right. These are the people I watched at last year\u2019s Republican National Convention when Donald Trump was nominated for President, one of the single most frightening experiences I have ever had watching television. I thought hard about The Handmaid\u2019s Tale that night, and Gilead; and Margaret Atwood\u2019s nightmarish fantasy which could \u201cnever happen\u201d seemed to be unfolding before my eyes. In the novel, black people, \u201cThe Children of Ham\u201d in the bible, are sent off to the \u201cNational Homeland One\u201d; \u201cUnwomen\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aolder white women and the infertile\u200a\u2014\u200aare sent to the Colonies. Basically, Gilead dispatches everyone their society considers garbage and worthless. This felt true to me when I read the book; I saw myself in the story by my absence, and I remember even smiling in recognition, appreciating that Atwood hadn\u2019t condescended to me as a reader. She knew the people she was writing about, and I knew them too. I knew that Gilead, with its white supremacy, wouldn\u2019t give a shit about black men or women, except as a labor force or as sex workers, and that as a gay man, I would be hanged for \u201cgender treachery.\u201d (Some of Miller\u2019s changes do work, and a subplot about a gay woman is very moving.) But it is unclear to me, as the series is conceived now, where, for example, Offred\u2019s interrracial daughter might be, and who would be taking care of her; would she be with a white family, and would they accept a black child, when orphaned black children are hard to place in families, black or white, in 2017? A critical scene from the book, in which Serena Joy produces a picture of Offred\u2019s daughter, who is still alive, as a way of manipulating her, hasn\u2019t yet appeared. Offred has had several clandestine exchanges with both the commander and his wife, yet hasn\u2019t once asked about her daughter\u2019s whereabouts, calling her character into question for the viewer. Where is the conversation, painful but necessary, in which Wiley\u2019s exasperated black Moira tells her white best friend to snap out of it, in which they are forced to examine entitlement in their friendship as black and white American women\u200a\u2014\u200awhat Moira has assumed about society and June has taken for granted? Despite admiring Wiley\u2019s performance, I must admit to missing \u201cwhite\u201d Moira from the book. Her punk rebelliousness and disobedience create an important archetype of a white woman who resists patriarchy, who refuses to be cute or girlish, or to \u201cplay nice\u201d. When black Moira roughs up the Aunt in the bathroom and snatches her cattleprod or taser, viewers may be conditioned to expect a violence reaction from a black woman (Wiley\u2019s smaller size helps subvert this expectation, but defeats her in the escape scene). But when Moira as a white woman kicks white patriarchal ass, something important is being repudiated, something else is at stake, and her rejecting white womanhood has different consequences for the character. What the series might have done is to have kept Moira white, and created another character whom Offred knew in college, a black woman whose fate she would also have had to speculate on. Or this woman, a close friend, and a mother herself, would be followed in a separate story line; we might see her life in the National Homelands, and find out what happened to her children. The shock for the viewer might be that, had this woman met Offred again and offered her testimony, much like impoverished Americans whose lives didn\u2019t change that much during the 1930s Depression, she might have admitted that life for her in the Republic of Gilead wasn\u2019t really that different from what she experienced living in Flint, Michigan in The United States of America. I am seven episodes into The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, and while I know what Gilead thinks about homosexuality and women\u2019s bodies, I have absolutely no idea how it feels about race. And that\u2019s a big problem. Because truly to appreciate the intersectionality of the forces against us now, we need to make the connection between an administration that would fight in court for a racist travel ban while threatening to overturn marriage equality and Roe vs. Wade. In the novel\u2019s concluding \u201chistorical notes\u201d Atwood writes, \u201cIt\u2019s racist policies\u2026were firmly rooted in the pre-Gilead period, and racist fears provided some of the emotional fuel that allowed the Gilead takeover to succeed as well as it did.\u201d At a coffee shop in my neighborhood, a woman behind the counter said she couldn\u2019t wait to watch the series, because \u201cI\u2019m way too lazy to read the book.\u201d It\u2019s exciting that the story has been brought to a larger audience, and while there are moments of greatness, what exactly are we experiencing, and what has been compromised? Atwood\u2019s triumph was taking white supremacy, patriarchy, religious fanaticism, totalitarianism, American slavery and racism, the Holocaust, South African apartheid, violence against gay men and women, and the historical oppression of women throughout the world, most of them of color, and condensing the experience into one character\u200a\u2014\u200aan American white woman named Offred. Her point was clear by the end of the book and I loved her for it: one woman\u2019s dystopia is another woman\u2019s Tuesday.

Today, with over 4 million women on the app, we want to share how our data and machine learning approach helped us grow. It\u2019s been chaotic but it is now under control. If we wanted to build a human-level tool to offer automated outfit advice, we needed to understand people\u2019s fashion taste. A friend can give us outfit advice because after seeing what we normally wear, she\u2019s learnt our style. How could we build a system that learns fashion taste? We had previous experience with taste-based projects and a background in machine learning applied to music and other sectors. We saw how a collaborative filtering tool transformed the music industry from blindness to totally understanding people (check out the Audioscrobbler story). It also made life better for those who love music, and created several unicorns along the way. With this background, we built the following thesis: online fashion will be transformed by a tool that understands taste. Because if you understand taste, you can delight people with relevant content and a meaningful experience. We also thought that \u201coutfits\u201d were the asset that would allow taste to be understood, to learn what people wear or have in their closet, and what style each of us like. We decided we were going to build that tool to understand taste. We focused on developing the correct dataset, and built two assets: our mobile app and our data platform. From previous experience building mobile products, even in Symbian back then, we knew it was easy to bring people to an app but difficult to retain them. So we focused on small iterations to learn as fast as possible. We launched an extremely early alpha of Chicisimo with one key functionality. We launched under another name and in another country. You couldn\u2019t even upload photos\u2026 but it allowed us to iterate with real data and get a lot of qualitative input. At some point, we launched the real Chicisimo, and removed this alpha from the App Store. We spent a long time trying to understand what our true levers of retention were, and what algorithms we needed in order to match content and people. Three things helped with retention: (a) identify retention levers using behavioral cohorts (we use Mixpanel for this). We run cohorts not only over the actions that people performed, but also over the value they received. This was hard to conceptualize for an app such as Chicisimo*. We thought in terms of what specific and measurable value people received, measured it, and run cohorts over those events, and then we were able to iterate over value received, not only over actions people performed. We also defined and removed anti-levers (all those noisy things that distract from the main value) and got all the relevant metrics for different time periods: first session, first day, first week, etc. These super specific metrics allowed us to iterate (*Nir Eyal\u2019s book Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products discusses a framework to create habits that helped us build our model); (b) re-think the onboarding process, once we knew the levers of retention. We define it as the process by which new signups find the value of the app as soon as possible, and before we lose them. We clearly articulated to ourselves what needed to happen (what and when). It went something like this: If people don\u2019t do [action] during their first 7 minutes in their first session, they will not come back. So we need to change the experience to make that happen. We also run tons of user-tests with different types of people, and observed how they perceived (or mostly didn\u2019t) the retention lever; (c) define how we learn. The data approach described above is key, but there is much more than data when building a product people love. In our case, first of all, we think that the what-to-wear problem is a very important one to solve, and we truly respect it. We obsess over understanding the problem, and over understanding how our solution is helping, or not. It\u2019s our way of showing respect. This leads me to one of the most surprising aspects IMO of building a product: the fact that, regularly, we access new corpuses of knowledge that we did not have before, which help us improve the product significantly. When we\u2019ve obtained these game-changing learnings, it\u2019s always been by focusing on two aspects: how people relate to the problem, and how people relate to the product (the red arrows in the image below). There are a million subtleties that happen in these two relations, and we are building Chicisimo by trying to understand them. Now, we know that at any point there is something important that we don\u2019t know and therefore the question always is: how can we learn\u2026 sooner? Talking with one of my colleagues, she once told me, \u201cthis is not about data, this is about people\u201d. And the truth is, from day one we\u2019ve learnt significantly by having conversations with women about how they relate with the problem, and with solutions. We use several mechanisms: having face to face conversations, reading the emails we get from women without predefined questions, or asking for feedback around specific topics (we now use Typeform and its a great tool for product insight). And then we talk among ourselves and try to articulate the learnings. We also seek external references: we talk with other product people, we play with inspiring apps, and we re-read articles that help us think. This process is what allows us to learn, and then build product and develop technology. At some point, we were lucky to get noticed by the App Store team, and we\u2019ve been featured as App of the Day throughout the world (view Apple\u2019s description of Chicisimo, here). On December 31st, Chicisimo was featured in a summary of apps the App Store team did, we are the pink \u201cC.\u201d in the left image below \ud83d\ude00. The app got viewed by 957,437 uniques thanks to this feature, for a total of 1.3M times. In our case, app features have a 0,5% conversion rate from impression to app install (normally: impression > product page view > install); ASO has a 3% conversion, and referrers 45%. The app aims at understanding taste so we can do a better job at suggesting outfit ideas. The simple act of delivering the right content at the right time can absolutely wow people, although it is an extremely difficult utility to build. Chicisimo content is 100% user-generated, and this poses some challenges: the system needs to classify different types of content automatically, build the right incentives, and understand how to match content and needs. We soon saw that there was a lot of data coming in. After thinking \u201chey, how cool we are, look at all this data we have\u201d, we realized it was actually a nightmare because, being chaotic, the data wasn\u2019t actionable. This wasn\u2019t cool at all. But then we decided to start giving some structure to parts of the data, and we ended inventing what we called the Social Fashion Graph. The graph is a compact representation of how needs, outfits and people interrelate, a concept that helped us build the data platform. The data platform creates a high-quality dataset linked to a learning and training world, our app, which therefore improves with each new expression of taste. We thought of outfits as playlists: an outfit is a combination of items that makes sense to consume together. Using collaborative filtering, the relations captured here allow us to offer recommendations in different areas of the app. There was still a lot of noise in the data, and one of the hardest things was to understand how people were expressing the same fashion need in different ways, which made matching content and needs even more difficult. Lots of people might need ideas to go to school, and express that specific need in a hundred different ways. How do you capture this diversity, and how do you provide structure to it? We built a system to collect concepts (we call them needs) and captured equivalences among different ways to express the same need. We ended up building a list of the world\u2019s what-to-wear needs, which we call our ontology. This really cleaned up the dataset and helped us understand what we had. This understanding led to better product decisions. We now understand that an outfit, a need or a person, can have a lot of understandable data attached, if you allow people to express freely (the app) while having the right system behind (the platform). Structuring data gave us control, while encouraging unstructured data gave us knowledge and flexibility. The end result is our current system. A system that learns the meaning of an outfit, how to respond to a need, or the taste of an individual. And I wouldn\u2019t even dare saying that this is Day 1 for us. Screenshot of an internal tool. The amount of work we have in front of us is immense, but we feel things are now under control. One of the new areas we\u2019ve been working on is adding a fourth element to the Social Fashion Graph: shoppable products. A system to match outfits to products automatically, and to help people decide what to buy next. This is pretty exciting. Back when we built recommender systems for music and other products, it was pretty easy (that\u2019s what we think now, we obviously didn\u2019t think that at the time:). First, it was easy to capture that you liked a given song. Then, it was easy to capture the sequence in which you and others would listen to that song, and therefore you could capture the correlations. With this data, you could do a lot. However, as we soon found out, fashion has its own challenges. There is not an easy way to match an outfit to a shoppable product (think about most garments in your wardrobe, most likely you won\u2019t find a link to view/buy those garments online, something you can do for many other products you have at home). Another challenge: the industry is not capturing how people describe clothes or outfits, so there is a strong disconnect between many ecommerces and its shoppers (we think we\u2019ve solved that problem. Also Similar.ai and Twiggle are working on it). Another challenge: style is complex to capture and classify by a machine. Now, deep learning brings a new tool to add to other mechanisms, and changes everything. Owning the correct data set allows us to focus on the specific narrow use cases related to outfit recommendations, and to focus on delivering value through the algorithms instead of spending time collecting and cleaning data. \ud83d\udc49 Now comes the fun and rewarding part, so please email us if you want to join the team and help build algorithms that have real impact on people\u200a\u2014\u200awe are 100% remote, Slack based \ud83d\udc48 -\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude09 \ud83d\ude09 \ud83d\ude09. People\u2019s very personal style can become as actionable as metadata and possibly as transparent as well (?), and I think we can see the path to get there. As we have a consumer product that people already love, we can ship early results of these algorithms partially hidden, and increase their presence as feedback improves results. There are more and more researchers working of these areas, you can read Tangseng\u2019s paper on recommending outfits from personal closet or clothing parsing project, or how Edgar Simo-Serra defines similarity between images using user-provided metadata. Outfits are a key asset in the race to capture the $123 billion US apparel market. Data is also the reason many players are taking outfits to the forefront of technology: outfits are a daily habit, and have proven to be great assets to attract and retain shoppers, and capture their data. Many players are introducing a Shop the Look section with outfits from real people: Amazon, Zalando or Google are a few examples. Google recently introduced a new feature called Style Ideas showing how a \u201cproduct can be worn in real life\u201d. Same month Amazon launched its Alexa Echo Look to help you with your outfit, and Alibaba\u2019s artificial intelligence personal stylist helped them achieve record sales during Singles Day. Some people think that fashion data is in the same place as music data was in 2003: ready to play a very relevant role. The good news is: the daily habit of deciding what to wear will not change. The need to buy new clothes won\u2019t disappear, either. So, what do you think? Where will we be 10 years from now? Will taste data build unique online experiences? What role will outfits play? How will machine learning change fashion ecommerce? Will everything change, 10 years from now? We are a small team of eight, four on product and four engineers. We believe in focusing on our very specific problem, no one on earth can understand the problem better than us. We also believe on building the complete solution ourselves while doing as few things as possible. We work 100% remote and live in Slack + GitHub.

Let\u2019s take them in chronological order: First, Germany\u2019s new law stands in contrast to current U.S. law (47 U.S.C. 230), which shields Internet platforms form liability for the content they host. Germany\u2019s law has already had a tumultuous first couple of weeks, with Twitter temporarily suspending a satirical account and alt-right leaders using the law to paint themselves \u201cvictims\u201d of censorship. The law puts platforms in the difficult position of having to remove \u201cobviously illegal\u201d hate speech within 24 hours of receiving a notification, and removing simply \u201cillegal\u201d speech with 7 days. Perhaps it\u2019s not uncharacteristic for Germany, a country with notoriously strong hate speech laws, to place the onus of censorship on these private companies. But even the first few days of the law in action illustrate the danger of making technology companies judge and jury over what constitutes illegal content. The power of these platforms is that anyone can post anything, and a law restricting that fundamentally constrains individual voices. And Germany\u2019s law is already resulting in a regime of over censorship as companies respond to the new incentives, leading to the voices of some not being heard. A few days after that, Steve Kerr got on his pedestal about some \u201csocietal issue\u201d that has supposedly infected our society: People are entertained by some blowhard bloviating into a microphone and the media is covering it to attract more viewers? What a revelation, Steve! The real difference is that if ESPN didn\u2019t cover it, people would get their Big Baller fix from Facebook, Instagram, or another platform of their choice. So ESPN might as well make a few bucks getting clicks while they can. Sports has historically been protected from the disruption technology has wrought on traditional media, driven by its live must-see nature and the tight control teams maintain over access to players and coaches. Kerr is asking ESPN to play the same role that Germany has asked social media platforms to play, albeit on a smaller scale: censor content that we, the NBA, don\u2019t like. But Ball is showing that\u2019s not how the model works anymore, and it\u2019s pissing people off. For better or worse, the world is demand-driven now. Consumers, users and viewers get what they want, and if your organization isn\u2019t willing to serve it to them, you\u2019re dead. Kerr seems to think if ESPN stops putting a mic in front of LaVar, he\u2019ll go away. But that\u2019s not how it works anymore, as much as some might like it. Logan Paul is exhibit A here; he\u2019s continued to see subscriber growth since posting his disgusting video on December 31. YouTube can cut off the money siphon, but he\u2019s still getting the attention he obviously craves much so much: Meanwhile, Facebook\u2019s latest attempt to \u201cfix\u201d itself in the U.S. is\u00a0\u2026 weird. They say they\u2019ll emphasize posts from friends and family more than news now, but personal updates on the site have been declining for years. It\u2019s a laudable attempt to move towards the \u201cquality engagement\u201d I suggested Facebook strive for last week, but it\u2019s not clear it\u2019ll truly solve the problems of filter bubbles and fake news. As the \u2018book\u2019s head of News Feed explained, \u201cyou might have a really engaging conversation with someone who shares interests in a group.\u201d Yea, and that just might be a white supremacy group. As a society, we\u2019re only just beginning to grapple with the problems wrought by the structure of an increasingly centralized Internet dominated by a few mega-platforms. Sure, Zuckerberg\u2019s solution might be right. But, more likely, he\u2019s wrong. And then he\u2019ll try the next thing, and then the next thing, while we all wait. However, in a vibrant, innovative environment, many people and companies are trying many things at once, and the best one tends to win out. With our current Internet structure, whatever Zuckerberg says goes in the world of social media (and so it is for Google in search, and arguably, Amazon in ecommerce). Surely, many ideas were dreamt up and thrown away by Facebook before it arrived at the announced solution\u200a\u2014\u200amonopolies like Facebook notoriously suppress innovation internally. Ma Bell is perhaps most infamous, hiding inventions like the answering machine and mobile phone for decades. But this begets the real contradiction of the situation: it\u2019s actually better to have just one social media platform serving everyone, and we\u2019ve all benefitted from this scale in many ways. These platforms are most valuable when anyone can join, post, and attract an audience, even idiots like Logan Paul and LaVar Ball. But we\u2019re now beginning to realize the costs of this centralized structure and lack of true platform choice. Historically, the answer to such a regime has come in the form of a new, truly disruptive technology or a landmark antitrust case. Finally, former President Obama made an appearance on David Letterman\u2019s new Netflix show, and one of the topics they dug into was the issue of social media and filter bubbles. Obama ended the discussion with a note of optimism, saying, \u201cI think it is a solvable problem, but I think it\u2019s one that we have to spend a lot of time thinking about\u201d. And so we\u2019ll leave with that same note of optimism. A recently published Amazon patent application details a new way of figuring out media (e.g. music, movies) that is likely to be popular. The system identifies early adopters that tend to listen to (for example) popular music before that music became popular, and can then follow the listening patterns of these \u201cearly adopters\u201d to predict obscure or unpopular artists that may become popular, recommending them to other users. Yea, but what if the hipster is listening on vinyl? Last week was conference-palooza, because nothing is more important than important people getting together to talk about important things. With both the Consumer Electronics Show and JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, many important things were certainly talked about. And while there was plenty to be excited about (I\u2019m all for free robot-therapy stuffed ducks for kids), dispatches from the front line illustrate how far we still have to go: The Future is Michael. 94% of company presenters at JPMorgan were male, while 77% of all speakers were male. STAT News provided the starkest statistic, showing that 22 Michaels were speaking, but only 20 female CEOs. STAT News CES Is No Better. In the past seven years, only 3 women have spoken on CES\u2019 main stage. That number didn\u2019t increase this year, as no women were keynote speakers. \u201cAs upsetting as it is, there is a limited pool when it comes to women in these positions,\u201d CES\u2019 organizers said. (1) That\u2019s idiotic and (2) if the organizers of the largest consumer electronics trade show in the country can\u2019t understand how they can bring change to the technology industry, we clearly have a long way to go. Recode Apparently building a cool cam is only half-pipe the battle. GoPro is reportedly testing the waters for a potential sale, and hopefully GoPro the company has more buyers than GoPro the camera. Its stock had recently taken a 20% hit when GoPro adjusted Q4 2017 guidance waaaaay down. Snapchat will probably buy them because, as we\u2019re constantly reminded, Snap is a \u201ccamera company.\u201d Ever gotten an Instagram ad for a free watch or another deal that seemed to good to be true?

Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Research is a common phenomenon in the user experience industry. It occurs when bright researchers conduct brilliant UX studies, but the insights never make it out of their brain and into the brain of their stakeholders. It\u2019s as if the research might never have taken place at all. Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cat is a famous thought experiment highlighting the observer effect in quantum physics. If a cat is in a box with poison and has a 50/50 chance of surviving, the cat could theoretically be alive or dead, or both, until someone looks inside the box and checks. Just like Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cat, your research could be useless, impactful, or both\u200a\u2014\u200abut it just isn\u2019t anything until someone looks inside the box. Companies like Facebook tie promotions and raises to \u201cimpact\u201d employees have upon the project for a reason. Though this approach has a few downsides that I\u2019ll explore in another article, it does prompt researchers to tie the impact of their research to specific product changes. When this works well, it incentivizes researchers to more proactively share their findings and follow through on areas of interest with design and product management to make sure improvements ship. When you have a bad case of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s research, this may mean you can\u2019t prove you\u2019ve had any impact at all on the product. This article will cover the few major steps in \u2018socializing\u2019 your research\u200a\u2014\u200aor proactively bringing it into the design or decision making processes. In general, we socialize research for a few company-wide benefits: Your team\u2019s research blindness may be caused by any combination of: lack of awareness, ignorance, contempt, day drunkeness, or lack of bandwidth. More likely though, there\u2019s a problem with your method of communicating your findings. Even if your research is great, pertinent, timely\u200a\u2014\u200ait still doesn\u2019t speak for itself. User research, especially at a large company, is a role that requires the researcher to act as a spokesperson and mouthpiece for the user. Here are a few ways that you can better share and promote your research findings. If you have other methods you employ, please let us know more about them in the comments! Above all, the information you communicate must be accurate and given the correct context (ie. sample size, statistical significance). But once you\u2019ve nailed accuracy, make that shit as colorful, eye-catching and incendiary as possible to get people to read and absorb it. Here are a few tips on effective slide decks from: UX Research is Boring and Nobody Reads It. If your research is unfindable, it can\u2019t be used. I create a research \u201cDirectory\u201d for each product I work on with a team and circulate the link with pretty much everything I share. The Directory serves as an index of links. In the Directory, I include the following: I employ three main methods of sharing my research directly with peers. 1:1 Meetings When I work on product teams I generally meet with the product manager once a week to gauge progress and priorities. I also meet 1:1 about once a week with the designers I work with to look at their most recent work and discuss edge cases and assumptions/concerns to explore in upcoming research. 1:1\u2019s or small group meetings are also an excellent time to introduce the research you\u2019ve just completed. You can answer questions and explore individual follow-up\u200a\u2014\u200afor example, if a designer will need to re-think an interaction based on user research, you can let them know to plan extra time in their schedule to addres. Research Read Out is a Terrible Name Though I haven\u2019t found a better way to refer to collecting people and sharing my research, Research Read Out is a deadly boring title for something awesome. For each big research report (ex. a diary study or a set of surveys that reveal a trend) I like to organize a read out to share findings with context and answer questions. Schedule 45 minutes to 1 hour. Ensure you have video conferencing set up, share the link, and record the session for those who cannot be there. Go through your report slide-by-slide, adding a bit of color or real examples to provide context. Photos and video clips from testing are your friend. Because I like to multitask and the audience is captive I also use these sessions to assign work or formally call issues out to add to our development or design timelines. I ask people about future availability and put time on the calendar so we remember to follow up. Don\u2019t be scared. Jokes helps when you\u2019re being this direct. So does owning up to your approach and your intensity. Speaking up and sharing your research can only help you and your user. When people react negatively to my action-oriented approach, it is to critique my personality rather than my accuracy or effectiveness. A grown woman can survive some shade, especially when my products end up shipping and numbers go up. User research shouldn\u2019t be conducted in a vacuum. The researcher can work hand-in-hand with the rest of the product team to make sure that the user is at the center of the whole process. Here are a few of my favorite ways to inject your research and knowledge about the user into the the design process. Run a Sprint Once you\u2019ve got a nest of related issues, (for example, all kinds of reports of issues with the login process), it could be time to recommend a design sprint to address the whole section. Work with the design team to insert user research into the sprint. I like to start sprints with a brief overview of our background knowledge on the user, their preferences and limitations. When I have the time to get really fancy, I incorporate a quick round of user testing into the end of a sprint so designers can see reactions to the earliest sketches of their work and adjust accordingly. Get Brainstorm Priorities Right When your team is planning their next round of work or next set of feature priorities, jump in and insert some research. Start brainstorms off by listing user needs and user priorities, then discuss company goals and metrics. If you ask your design team to just jump in and \u201cmaximize new signups\u201d, you run the risk of designing predatory dark patterns. Ideally a team is on the same page when it comes to priorities and what gets recommended for build or shipping. The user researcher\u2019s responsibility is advise the design, check impact with data, and above all, help you user achieve their goals. As such, feel empowered to speak up in decision making meetings to point people towards relevant data or knowledge that you think is important to know about the user. For example, if the product is about to ship but you have concerns about people misunderstanding, it is okay to pump the brakes and point people towards the data that makes you feel that way. In fact, it is your responsibility\u00a0:) Do you have tips or ways you\u2019ve effectively shared your research findings? Please tell us about them in the comments below! By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out. Research, design, and occasional short science fiction. Previously UX researcher at Facebook, fellow at Stanford\u2019s d.school (I work on contract\u200a\u2014\u200aget in touch)", "claps": "33", "datetime": "2018-02-12T21:10:42.879Z", "title": "If Nobody Reads Your Research, Did it Really\u00a0Happen?", "author": "Caitria O'Neill", "url": "https://medium.com/@caitriaoneill/if-nobody-reads-your-research-did-it-really-happen-815bfca103ca?source=topic_page---8------1----------------"}, {"text": "I originally wrote and published a version of this article in September 2016. Since then, quite a bit has happened, further cementing my view that these changes are coming and that the implications will be even more substantial. I decided it was time to update this article with some additional ideas and a few changes. As I write this, Uber just announced that it just ordered 24,000 self-driving Volvos. Tesla just released an electric, long-haul tractor trailer with extraordinary technical specs (range, performance) and self-driving capabilities (UPS just preordered 125!). And, Tesla just announced what will probably be the quickest production car ever made\u200a\u2014\u200aperhaps the fastest. It will go zero to sixty in about the time it takes you to read zero to sixty. And, of course, it will be able to drive itself. The future is quickly becoming now. Google just ordered thousands of Chryslers for its self-driving fleet (that are already on the roads in AZ). In September of 2016, Uber had just rolled out its first self-driving taxis in Pittsburgh, Tesla and Mercedes were rolling out limited self-driving capabilities and cities around the world were negotiating with companies who want to bring self-driving cars and trucks to their cities. Since then, all of the major car companies have announced significant steps towards mostly or entirely electric vehicles, more investments have been made in autonomous vehicles, driverless trucks now seem to be leading rather than following in terms of the first large scale implementations and there\u2019ve been a few more incidents (i.e. accidents). I believe that the timeframe for significant adoption of this technology has shrunk in the past year as technology has gotten better faster and as the trucking industry has increased its level of interest and investment. I believe that my daughter, who is now just over 1 years old, will never have to learn to drive or own a car. The impact of driverless vehicles will be profound and impact almost every part of our lives. Below are my updated thoughts about what a driverless future will be like. Some of these updates are from feedback to my original article (thanks to those who contributed!!!), some are based on technology advances in the past year and others are just my own speculations. What could happen when cars and trucks drive themselves? 1. People won\u2019t own their own cars. Transport will be delivered as a service from companies who own fleets of self-driving vehicles. There are so many technical, economic, safety advantages to the transportation-as-a-service that this change may come much faster than most people expect. Owning a vehicle as an individual will become a novelty for collectors and maybe competitive racers. 2. Software/technology companies will own more of the world\u2019s economy as companies like Uber, Google and Amazon turn transportation into a pay-as-you-go service. Software will indeed eat this world. Over time, they\u2019ll own so much data about people, patterns, routes and obstacles that new entrants will have huge barriers to enter the market 3. Without government intervention (or some sort of organized movement), there will be a tremendous transfer of wealth to a very small number of people who own the software, battery/power manufacturing, vehicle servicing and charging/power generation/maintenance infrastructure. There will be massive consolidation of companies serving these markets as scale and efficiency will become even more valuable. Cars (perhaps they\u2019ll be renamed with some sort-of-clever acronym) will become like the routers that run the Internet\u200a\u2014\u200amost consumers won\u2019t know or care who made them or who owns them. 4. Vehicle designs will change radically\u200a\u2014\u200avehicles won\u2019t need to withstand crashes in the same way, all vehicles will be electric (self-driving + software + service providers = all electric). They may look different, come in very different shapes and sizes, maybe attach to each other in some situations. There will likely be many significant innovations in materials used for vehicle construction\u200a\u2014\u200afor example, tires and brakes will be re-optimized with very different assumptions, especially around variability of loads and much more controlled environments. The bodies will likely be primarily made of composites (like carbon fiber and fiberglass) and 3D printed. Electric vehicles with no driver controls will require 1/10th or fewer the number of parts (perhaps even 1/100th) and thus will be quicker to produce and require much less labor. There may even be designs with almost no moving parts (other than wheels and motors, obviously). 5. Vehicles will mostly swap batteries rather than serve as the host of battery charging. Batteries will be charged in distributed and highly optimized centers\u200a\u2014\u200alikely owned by the same company as the vehicles or another national vendor. There may be some entrepreneurial opportunity and a marketplace for battery charging and swapping, but this industry will likely be consolidated quickly. The batteries will be exchanged without human intervention\u200a\u2014\u200alikely in a carwash-like drive thru 6. Vehicles (being electric) will be able to provide portable power for a variety of purposes (which will also be sold as a service)\u200a\u2014\u200aconstruction job sites (why use generators), disaster/power failures, events, etc. They may even temporarily or permanently replace power distribution networks (i.e. power lines) for remote locations\u200a\u2014\u200aimagine a distributed power generation network with autonomous vehicles providing \u201clast mile\u201d services to some locations 7. Driver\u2019s licenses will slowly go away as will the Department of Motor Vehicles in most states. Other forms of ID may emerge as people no longer carry driver\u2019s licenses. This will probably correspond with the inevitable digitization of all personal identification\u200a\u2014\u200avia prints, retina scans or other biometric scanning 8. There won\u2019t be any parking lots or parking spaces on roads or in buildings. Garages will be repurposed\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe as mini loading docks for people and deliveries. Aesthetics of homes and commercial buildings will change as parking lots and spaces go away. There will be a multi-year boom in landscaping and basement and garage conversions as these spaces become available 9. Traffic policing will become redundant. Police transport will also likely change quite a bit. Unmanned police vehicles may become more common and police officers may use commercial transportation to move around routinely. This may dramatically change the nature of policing, with newfound resources from the lack of traffic policing and dramatically less time spent moving around 10. There will be no more local mechanics, car dealers, consumer car washes, auto parts stores or gas stations. Towns that have been built around major thoroughfares will change or fade 11. The auto insurance industry as we know it will go away (as will the significant investing power of the major players of this industry). Most car companies will go out of business, as will most of their enormous supplier networks. There will be many fewer net vehicles on the road (maybe 1/10th, perhaps even less) that are also more durable, made of fewer parts and much more commoditized 12. Traffic lights and signs will become obsolete. Vehicles may not even have headlights as infrared and radar take the place of the human light spectrum. The relationship between pedestrians (and bicycles) and cars and trucks will likely change dramatically. Some will come in the form of cultural and behavioral changes as people travel in groups more regularly and walking or cycling becomes practical in places where it isn\u2019t today 13. Multi-modal transportation will become a more integrated and normal part of our ways of moving around. In other words, we\u2019ll often take one type of vehicle to another, especially when traveling longer distances. With coordination and integration, the elimination of parking and more deterministic patterns, it will become ever-more efficient to combine modes of transport 14. The power grid will change. Power stations via alternative power sources will become more competitive and local. Consumers and small businesses with solar panels, small scale tidal or wave power generators, windmills and other local power generation will be able to sell KiloWattHours to the companies who own the vehicles. This will change \u201cnet metering\u201d rules and possibly upset the overall power delivery model. It might even be the beginning of truly distributed power creation and transport. There will likely be a significant boom in innovation in power production and delivery models. Over time, ownership of these services will probably be consolidated across a very small number of companies 15. Traditional petroleum products (and other fossil fuels) will become much less valuable as electric cars replace fuel powered vehicles and as alternative energy sources become more viable with portability of power (transmission and conversion eat tons of power). There are many geopolitical implications to this possible shift. As implications of climate change become ever-clearer and present, these trends will likely accelerate. Petroleum will continue to be valuable for making plastics and other derived materials, but will not be burned for energy at any scale. Many companies, oil-rich countries and investors have already begun accommodating for these changes 16. Entertainment funding will change as the auto industry\u2019s ad spending goes away. Think about how many ads you see or hear about cars, car financing, car insurance, car accessories and car dealers. There are likely to be many other structural and cultural changes that come from the dramatic changes to the transportation industry. We\u2019ll stop saying \u201cshift into high gear\u201d and other driving-related colloquialisms as the references will be lost on future generations 17. The recent corporate tax rate reductions in the \u201c..Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018\u201d will accelerate investments in automation including self-driving vehicles and other forms of transportation automation. Flush with new cash and incentives to invest capital soon, many businesses will invest in technology and solutions that reduce their labor costs. 18. The car financing industry will go away, as will the newly huge derivative market for packaged sub-prime auto loans which will likely itself cause a version of the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis as it blows up. 19. Increases in unemployment, increased student loan, vehicle and other debt defaults could quickly spiral into a full depression. The world that emerges on the other side will likely have even more dramatic income and wealth stratification as entry level jobs related to transportation and the entire supply chain of the existing transportation system go away. The convergence of this with hyper-automation in production and service delivery (AI, robotics, low-cost computing, business consolidation, etc) may permanently change how societies are organized and how people spend their time 20. There will be many new innovations in luggage and bags as people no longer keep stuff in cars and loading and unloading packages from vehicles becomes much more automated. The traditional trunk size and shape will change. Trailers or other similar detachable devices will become much more commonplace to add storage space to vehicles. Many additional on demand services will become available as transportation for goods and services becomes more ubiquitous and cheaper. Imagine being able to design, 3D print and put on an outfit as you travel to a party or the office (if you\u2019re still going to an office)\u2026 21. Consumers will have more money as transportation (a major cost, especially for lower income people and families) gets much cheaper and ubiquitous\u200a\u2014\u200athough this may be offset by dramatic reductions in employment as technology changes many times faster than people\u2019s ability to adapt to new types of work 22. Demand for taxi and truck drivers will go down, eventually to zero. Someone born today might not understand what a truck driver is or even understand why someone would do that job\u200a\u2014\u200amuch like people born in the last 30 years don\u2019t understand how someone could be employed as a switchboard operator 23. The politics will get ugly as lobbyists for the auto and oil industries unsuccessfully try to stop the driverless car. They\u2019ll get even uglier as the federal government deals with assuming huge pension obligations and other legacy costs associated with the auto industry. My guess is that these pension obgligations won\u2019t ultimately be honored and certain communities will be devastated. The same may be true of pollution clean-up efforts around the factories and chemical plants that were once major components of the vehicle supply chain 24. The new players in vehicle design and manufacturing will be a mix of companies like Uber, Google and Amazon and companies you don\u2019t yet know. There will probably be 2 or 3 major players who control >80% of the customer-facing transportation market. There may become API-like access to these networks for smaller players\u200a\u2014\u200amuch like app marketplaces for iPhone and Android. However, the majority of the revenue will flow to a few large players as it does today to Apple and Google for smartphones 25. Supply chains will be disrupted as shipping changes. Algorithms will allow trucks to be fuller. Excess (latent) capacity will be priced cheaper. New middlemen and warehousing models will emerge. As shipping gets cheaper, faster and generally easier, retail storefronts will continue to lose footing in the marketplace. 26. The role of malls and other shopping areas will continue to shift\u200a\u2014\u200ato be replaced by places people go for services, not products. There will be virtually no face to face purchases of physical goods. 27. Amazon and/or a few other large players will put Fedex, UPS and USPS out of business as their transportation network becomes orders of magnitude more cost efficient than existing models\u200a\u2014\u200alargely from a lack of legacy costs like pensions, higher union labor costs and regulations (especially USPS) that won\u2019t keep up with new the pace of technology change. 3D printing will also contribute to this as many day-to-day products are printed at home rather than purchased. 28. The same vehicles will often transport people and goods as algorithms optimize all routes. And, off-peak utilization will allow for other very inexpensive delivery options. In other words, packages will be increasingly delivered at night. Add autonomous drone aircraft to this mix and there\u2019ll be very little reason to believe that traditional carriers (Fedex, USPS, UPS, etc) will survive at all. 29. Roads will be much emptier and smaller (over time) as self-driving cars need much less space between them (a major cause of traffic today), people will share vehicles more than today (carpooling), traffic flow will be better regulated and algorithmic timing (i.e. leave at 10 versus 9:30) will optimize infrastructure utilization. Roads will also likely be smoother and turns optimally banked for passenger comfort. High speed underground and above ground tunnels (maybe integrating hyperloop technology or this novel magnetic track solution) will become the high speed network for long haul travel. 30. Short hop domestic air travel may be largely displaced by multi-modal travel in autonomous vehicles. This may be countered by the advent of lower cost, more automated air travel. This too may become part of integrated, multi-modal transportation. 31. Roads will wear out much more slowly with fewer vehicle miles, lighter vehicles (with less safety requirements). New road materials will be developed that drain better, last longer and are more environmentally friendly. These materials might even be power generating (solar or reclamation from vehicle kinetic energy). At the extreme, they may even be replaced by radically different designs\u200a\u2014\u200atunnels, magnetic tracks, other hyper-optimized materials 32. Premium vehicle services will have more compartmentalized privacy, more comfort, good business features (quiet, wifi, bluetooth for each passenger, etc), massage services and beds for sleeping. They may also allow for meaningful in-transit real and virtual meetings. This will also likely include aromatherapy, many versions of in-vehicle entertainment systems and even virtual passengers to keep you company. 33. Exhilaration and emotion will almost entirely leave transportation. People won\u2019t brag about how nice, fast, comfortable their cars are. Speed will be measured by times between end points, not acceleration, handling or top speed. 34. Cities will become much more dense as fewer roads and vehicles will be needed and transport will be cheaper and more available. The \u201cwalkable city\u201d will continue to be more desirable as walking and biking become easier and more commonplace. When costs and timeframes of transit change, so will the dynamics of who lives and works where. 35. People will know when they leave, when they\u2019ll get where they\u2019re going. There will be few excuses for being late. We will be able to leave later and cram more into a day. We\u2019ll also be able to better track kids, spouses, employees and so forth. We\u2019ll be able to know exactly when someone will arrive and when someone needs to leave to be somewhere at a particular time. 36. There will be no more DUI/OUI offenses. Restaurants and bars will sell more alcohol. People will consume more as they no longer need to consider how to get home and will be able to consume inside vehicles 37. We\u2019ll have less privacy as interior cameras and usage logs will track when and where we go and have gone. Exterior cameras will also probably record surroundings, including people. This may have a positive impact on crime, but will open up many complex privacy issues and likely many lawsuits. Some people may find clever ways to game the system\u200a\u2014\u200awith physical and digital disguises and spoofing. 38. Many lawyers will lose sources of revenue\u200a\u2014\u200atraffic offenses, crash litigation will reduce dramatically. Litigation will more likely be \u201cbig company versus big company\u201d or \u201cindividuals against big companies\u201d, not individuals against each other. These will settle more quickly with less variability. Lobbyists will probably succeed in changing the rules of litigation to favor the bigger companies, further reducing the legal revenue related to transportation. Forced arbitration and other similar clauses will become an explicit component of our contractual relationship with transportation providers. 39. Some countries will nationalize parts of their self-driving transportation networks which will result in lower costs, fewer disruptions and less innovation. 40. Cities, towns and police forces will lose revenue from traffic tickets, tolls (likely replaced, if not eliminated) and fuel tax revenues drop precipitously. These will probably be replaced by new taxes (probably on vehicle miles). These may become a major political hot-button issue differentiating parties as there will probably be a range of regressive versus progressive tax models. Most likely, this will be a highly regressive tax in the US, as fuel taxes are today. 41. Some employers and/or government programs will begin partially or entirely subsidizing transportation for employees and/or people who need the help. The tax treatment of this perk will also be very political. 42. Ambulance and other emergency vehicles will likely be used less and change in nature. More people will take regular autonomous vehicles instead of ambulances. Ambulances will transport people faster. Same may be true of military vehicles. 43. There will be significant innovations in first response capabilities as dependencies on people become reduced over time and as distributed staging of capacity becomes more common. 44. Airports will allow vehicles right into the terminals, maybe even onto the tarmac, as increased controls and security become possible. Terminal design may change dramatically as transportation to and from becomes normalized and integrated. The entire nature of air travel may change as integrated, multi-modal transport gets more sophisticated. Hyper-loops, high speed rail, automated aircraft and other forms of rapid travel will gain as traditional hub and spoke air travel on relatively large planes lose ground. 45. Innovative app-like marketplaces will open up for in-transit purchases, ranging from concierge services to food to exercise to merchandise to education to entertainment purchases. VR will likely play a large role in this. With integrated systems, VR (via headsets or screens or holograms) will become standard fare for trips more than a few minutes in duration. 46. Transportation will become more tightly integrated and packaged into many services\u200a\u2014\u200adinner includes the ride, hotel includes local transport, etc. This may even extend to apartments, story-term rentals (like AirBnB) and other service providers. 47. Local transport of nearly everything will become ubiquitous and cheap\u200a\u2014\u200afood, everything in your local stores. Drones will likely be integrated into vehicle designs to deal with \u201clast few feet\u201d on pickup and delivery. This will accelerate the demise of traditional retail stores and their local economic impact. 48. Biking and walking will become easier, safer and more common as roads get safer and less congested, new pathways (reclaimed from roads/parking lots/roadside parking) come online and with cheap, reliable transport available as a backup. 49. More people will participate in vehicle racing (cars, off road, motorcycles) to replace their emotional connection to driving. Virtual racing experiences may also grow in popularity as fewer people have the real experience of driving. 50. Many, many fewer people will be injured or killed on roads, though we\u2019ll expect zero and be disproportionately upset when accidents do happen. Hacking and non-malicious technical issues will replace traffic as the main cause of delays. Over time, resilience will increase in the systems. 51. Hacking of vehicles will be a serious issue. New software and communications companies and technologies will emerge to address these issues. We\u2019ll see the first vehicle hacking and its consequences. Highly distributed computing, perhaps using some form of blockchain, will likely become part of the solution as a counterbalance to systemic catastrophes\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as many vehicles being affected simultaneously. There will probably be a debate about whether and how law enforcement can control, observe and restrict transportation. 52. Many roads and bridges will be privatized as a small number of companies control most transport and make deals with municipalities. Over time, government may entirely stop funding roads, bridges and tunnels. There will be a significant legislative push to privatize more and more of the transportation network. Much like Internet traffic, there will likely become tiers of prioritization and some notion of in-network versus out-of-network travel and tolls for interconnection. Regulators will have a tough time keeping up with these changes. Most of this will be transparent to end users, but will probably create enormous barriers to entry for transportation start-ups and ultimately reduce options for consumers. 53. Innovators will come along with many awesome uses for driveways and garages that no longer contain cars. 54. There will be a new network of clean, safe, pay-to-use restrooms and other services (food, drinks, etc) that become part of the value-add of competing service providers 55. Mobility for seniors and people with disabilities will be greatly improved (over time) 56. Parents will have more options to move around their kids on their own. Premium secure end-to-end children\u2019s transport services will likely emerge. This may change many family relationships and increase the accessibility of services to parents and children. It may also further stratify the experiences of families with higher income and those with lower income. 57. Person to person movement of goods will become cheaper and open up new markets\u200a\u2014\u200athink about borrowing a tool or buying something on Craigslist. Latent capacity will make transporting goods very inexpensive. This may also open up new opportunities for P2P services at a smaller scale\u200a\u2014\u200alike preparing food or cleaning clothes. 58. People will be able to eat/drink in transit (like on a train or plane), consume more information (reading, podcasts, video, etc). This will open up time for other activities and perhaps increased productivity. 59. Some people may have their own \u201cpods\u201d to get into which will then be picked up by an autonomous vehicle, moved between vehicles automatically for logistic efficiencies. These may come in varieties of luxury and quality\u200a\u2014\u200athe Louis Vuitton pod may replace the Louis Vuitton trunk as the mark of luxury travel 60. There will be no more getaway vehicles or police vehicle chases. 61. Vehicles will likely be filled to the brim with advertising of all sorts (much of which you could probably act on in-route), though there will probably be ways to pay more to have an ad free experience. This will include highly personalized en route advertising that is particularly relevant to who you are, where you\u2019re going. 62. These innovations will make it to the developing world where congestion today is often remarkably bad and hugely costly. Pollution levels will come down dramatically. Even more people will move to the cities. Productivity levels will go up. Fortunes will be made as these changes happen. Some countries and cities will be transformed for the better. Some others will likely experience hyper-privatization, consolidation and monopoly-like controls. This may play out much like the roll-out of cell services in these countries\u200a\u2014\u200afast, consolidated and inexpensive. 63. Payment options will be greatly expanded, with packaged deals like cell phones, pre-paid models, pay-as-you-go models being offered. Digital currency transacted automatically via phones/devices will probably quickly replace traditional cash or credit card payments. 64. There will likely be some very clever innovations for movement of pets, equipment, luggage and other non-people items. Autonomous vehicles in the medium future (10\u201320 years) may have radically different designs that support carrying significantly more payload. 65. Some creative marketers will offer to partially or fully subsidize rides where customers deliver value\u200a\u2014\u200aby taking surveys, by participating in virtual focus groups, by promoting their brand via social media, etc. 66. Sensors of all sorts will be embedded in vehicles that will have secondary uses\u200a\u2014\u200alike improving weather forecasting, crime detection and prevention, finding fugitives, infrastructure conditions (such as potholes). This data will be monetized, likely by the companies who own the transportation services. 67. Companies like Google and Facebook will add to their databases everything about customer movements and locations. Unlike GPS chips that only tell them where someone is at the moment (and where they\u2019ve been), autonomous vehicle systems will know where you\u2019re going in real-time (and with whom). 68. Autonomous vehicles will create some new jobs and opportunities for entrepreneurs. However, these will be off-set many times by extraordinary job losses by nearly everyone in the transportation value chain today. In the autonomous future, a large number of jobs will go away. This includes drivers (which is in many states today the most common job), mechanics, gas station employees, most of the people who make cars and car parts or support those who do (due to huge consolidation of makers and supply chains and manufacturing automation), the marketing supply chain for vehicles, many people who work on and build roads/bridges, employees of vehicle insurance and financing companies (and their partners/suppliers), toll booth operators (most of whom have already been displaced), many employees of restaurants that support travelers, truck stops, retail workers and all the people whose businesses support these different types of companies and workers. 69. There will be some hardcore hold-outs who really like driving. But, over time, they\u2019ll become a less statistically relevant voting group as younger people, who\u2019ve never driven, will outnumber them. At first, this may be a 50 state regulated system\u200a\u2014\u200awhere driving yourself may actually become illegal in some states in the next 10 years while other states may continue to allow it for a long time. Some states will try, unsuccessfully, to block autonomous vehicles. 70. There will be lots of discussions about new types of economic systems\u200a\u2014\u200afrom universal basic income to new variations of socialism to a more regulated capitalist system\u200a\u2014\u200athat will result from the enormous impacts of autonomous vehicles. 71. In the path to a truly driverless future, there will be a number of key tipping points. At the moment, freight delivery may push autonomous vehicle use sooner than people transport. Large trucking companies may have the financial means and legislative influence to make rapid, dramatic changes. They are also better positioned to support hybrid approaches where only parts of their fleet or parts of the routes are automated. 72. Autonomous vehicles will radically change the power centers of the world. They will be the beginning of the end of burning hydrocarbons. The powerful interests who control these industries today will fight viciously to stop this. There may even be wars to slow down this process as oil prices start to plummet and demand dries up. 73. Autonomous vehicles will continue to play a larger role in all aspects of war\u200a\u2014\u200afrom surveillance to troop/robot movement to logistics support to actual engagement. Drones will be complemented by additional on-the-ground, in-space, in-the-water and under-the-water autonomous vehicles. Note: My original article was inspired by a presentation by Ryan Chin, CEO of Optimus Ridespeak at an MIT event about autonomous vehicles. He really got me thinking about how profound these advances could be to our lives. I\u2019m sure some of my thoughts above came from him. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

Also, it\u2019s a waterfall (different from the famous project waterfall), meaning that there is almost no room for agility\u200a\u2014\u200achanges at the top cause huge ripple effects of replanning and project cancellations at the bottom. Agile development addressed project waterfall, but didn\u2019t change planning waterfall. And then there\u2019s the impact on innovation and culture. As roadmaps allow only for a few big projects to be funded you have to prioritize and kill many potentially good ideas upfront. In top-down orgs the winner ideas come from management. In bottom-up orgs getting your idea to win became a very big deal, hence pitching, salesmanship and hype are now mandatory product management skills. To me it all felt very mid-20th century. So, what\u2019s the alternative? This is a planning system that I started using while working at Google and further adapted over the years based on the principles of Lean Startup and Agile Development. I\u2019ve introduced it to multiple companies and the results are very consistent\u200a\u2014\u200alightweight plans that are built for change, lower management overhead, improved team velocity and autonomy, better cross-company alignment and ultimately better products and solutions. The system is called GIST after its main building blocks: Goals, Ideas, Step-projects, and Tasks. Each has a different planning horizon and frequency of change, and may use different tools to track, but together they constitute all the core planning any company and team needs to do. I will do a longer post on each part of the system. Below is an overview. Most strategy plans commit a cardinal sin\u200a\u2014\u200athey specify solutions (use technology X, partner with company Y, launch country Z) rather than goals. Any modern army general will tell you this is backwards\u200a\u2014\u200ayou give the troops objectives and let them figure out ways to accomplish them (the principle of Mission Command). This method is more empowering, requires less managerial overhead and is far more robust\u200a\u2014\u200asolutions may come and go based on the situation in the field, but the objectives stay the same. Goals embody this principle\u200a\u2014\u200athey describe the company strategy in terms of desired outcomes: where we want to be, by when, and how will we know that we got there. Whenever anyone in the org is is wondering \u201cwhy are we doing this project?\u201d a goal should give the answer. I became most familiar with goals at Google where every quarter we meticulously spelled out our goals in the form of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Some believe that OKRs are one of the reasons why Google is so successful. Ideas describe hypothetical ways to achieve the goals. The key word here is hypothetical\u200a\u2014\u200athere can be many ideas how to achieve a given objective, but at most 1 in 3 ideas will deliver a positive result (often the ratio is far worse). The ideas of experienced leaders, product managers and designers don\u2019t have a better success ratio than the average. For these reasons in GIST we never kill ideas upfront, put them into a prioritization deathmatch, favor management ideas, or choose the ideas that are most hyped/pitched/politicized. This is what we do instead: It\u2019s tempting to pick a promising idea, turn it into a 9\u201318 month project and start executing. This is a common mistake and a very costly one\u200a\u2014\u200aspending quarters, or even years on a yet unproven idea is likely throwing good money in the bin because most ideas just aren\u2019t worth the investment. Instead we break the bigger project behind the idea into small step-projects, each no more than 10 weeks long, and execute them one at a time. For example: mockup \u2192 prototype \u2192 MVP \u2192 dogfood \u2192 beta \u2192 Launch In accordance with Lean-Startup\u2019s Build-Measure-Learn principle, each step-project is actually an experiment that tests the idea. In a successful progression we will put in each step-project a somewhat more complete version of the idea in front of more users for a longer duration of time. The end product is usually profoundly better than the one we imagined initially (see this post for an explanation why). Because step-projects are so small we avoid all the nasty side effects of long projects and we are able to test many more ideas in parallel with lower investment and with quicker learning. Ideas that don\u2019t work get dropped early, ideas that work get more investment. No need for pitching or politics. The ability come up with an idea and see it come to life and tested in a matter of weeks is incredibly liberating and enjoyable for everyone involved. You\u2019ll never want to do another long death-march project again. Finally, each step-project is broken down to bite-size activities which we call here Tasks. This part of the system is well covered by agile planning tools, kanban boards and other modern dev project management techniques. Nothing needs to change at this level. The only difference is that the layers above are now agile as well and ready for change. Planning with GIST is multi-tiered and iterative: I believe you don\u2019t. Roadmaps are usually used for these purposes: GIST is not a radical new idea\u200a\u2014\u200arather an amalgamation of ideas and methods that have been around for years, but often live in separation. It attempts to addresses all layers of the planning stack and creates a living plan that is built for change.

One particularly impactful use case is making it easier for small suppliers to get more financing on better terms. Most of the blockchain applications emerging right now are effectively porting existing solutions onto the blockchain (Uber for the blockchain, Airbnb for the blockchain, etc.). While these projects are valuable, the \u201ckiller apps\u201d of previous technological transitions have not just been simply porting over an existing use case and making it more efficient. They reimagine how the new technology could transform the way the industry works in some fundamental way. Amazon was not just Walmart on the internet; it took advantage of the zero marginal cost of shelf space to offer a much wider selection than Walmart could ever stock in physical stores. Google was not a giant Dewey Decimal catalog of websites; it took advantage of the web\u2019s hyperlinked, crawlable nature to facilitate more efficient searches and information discovery. There\u2019s every reason to think that the same will be true of the blockchain. The killer applications will reimagine how the world works in a fundamental way. I don\u2019t pretend to know what these killer applications will be, but one of the most promising ideas I\u2019ve heard is applying the blockchain to the supply chain to tokenize existing assets. This would allow any business to place their existing assets (like real estate, physical inventory, etc.) on the blockchain and borrow against those assets at extremely low interest rates and fuel their growth. If it works, this blockchain supply chain use case has the potential to disrupt a multi-trillion dollar industry and dramatically shift the corporate landscape. We are years, if not decades, away from this application being mainstream, but it is the sort of use case which I think shows the true potential of the technology. We\u2019ll take a quick look at the history and current state of the supply chain industry then jump into how the blockchain could reshape it. If you\u2019re looking for more about blockchain and cryptocurrency for business, click here to access my personal resource lists of where I\u2019ve found the best and most reliable information. The Industrial Era started with a centralization of production. Fordism, mass manufacturing, and Taylorism all helped make centralized production more efficient. This centralization took the form of large factories where raw commodities were turned into finished goods. Ford produced all their cars in a small number of factories which took in rubber and steel and spit out finished cars. After World War II, there was a second phase where corporations moved to centralize not just production but financialization. By demanding favorable terms from their suppliers, corporations became banks that could access cheap sources of capital and distribute it to areas where other factions, like small businesses in developing countries, can\u2019t compete because their cost of capital is much higher. The third phase was the centralization of risk. The belief was that, using hedge fund thinking, it was possible to have zero risk because it was all hedged away. They believed that if one part of their portfolio went down, another part would go up. At the dawn of the 21st century, these large corporations thought they had all the money with no risk. However, the centralization premise only works as long as you don\u2019t get a large shock to the system. If you get too large of a shock to the system, then there\u2019s a contagion, and you get the 2009 Global Financial Crisis.[1] Today, the supply chain industry accounts for 2/3rds of global GDP (about $54 trillion globally) and employs the majority of people worldwide. The primary inefficiency in the industry is a result of the relatively high levels of centralization. The largest players (e.g., Walmart or Starbucks) demand favorable terms from suppliers because they control massive amounts of purchasing power. This means that as you move closer to the players in the fringes of the supply network, the more strapped for cash they are. They are extending favorable terms to larger players and usually can\u2019t get a loan. However, the fringes are where the majority of the growth potential is and where that growth would make the biggest difference. For example, the small coffee farmer in Africa can\u2019t expand his farming because he has to give favorable terms to the import/export company, which has to give favorable terms to the roasting company, which has to give favorable terms to Starbucks. Starbucks may be able to get access to $1 billion at a 3% interest rate, where the coffee farmer in Africa can only get a $500 loan at a 20% interest rate. Then, Starbucks can invest in something that requires $1 million up front and has an expected rate of return of 10%. The coffee farmer can\u2019t get a large enough loan to expand her farm, and even if she could, it wouldn\u2019t be profitable at the interest rate she is paying. The end result is that all the capital is sitting with Starbucks, which has a relatively low ability to grow it, whereas the small business farmer has high compounding potential but no access to capital. Centralization was effective in a more stable environment, but in an unstable and fast-changing environment, smaller and less centralized is more adaptive and has better \u201ceconomic fitness.\u201d In today\u2019s world, economies of scale in the supply chain are getting less beneficial at best, or counterproductive at worse. According to economist Ronald Coase, as information gets better distributed, then the size of companies should come down and we should see a supply chain composed of smaller, nimbler companies that are better able to adapt. This has happened to some degree. More and more companies are outsourcing parts of their supply chain using outsourcing firms or online freelance marketplaces like Upwork. However, the shift has been much slower than would be optimal for overall economic growth because larger companies are using their access to cheap capital to buy smaller companies and then making them less efficient. Capital has the upper hand because it is relatively scarce: there is way less money than valued assets. There are about $700 trillion worth of valued assets in the world but only about $70 trillion of fiat and maybe another $100 trillion of things like stocks and bonds.[2] That means people are competing for access to that $170 trillion of money (fiat, stocks, and bonds). In the supply chain, that money needs to go from the big companies to the medium-sized ones to the individual coffee farmer. Blockchain technology creates the possibility of filling the gap between the amount of money available and the amount of valuable assets using tokenization. This would give the smaller, high-growth players at the fringes of the network, like the coffee farmer, access to capital at a very affordable rate. Historically, it was possible to take an asset you owned, like your house, to some entity that would issue a soft currency not backed by gold or some other hard asset. This might have been a bank issuing their own script in the Middle Ages or the pharaoh a thousand years ago giving you a hieroglyphic tablet. This is effectively what tokenization does. However, the major difference enabled by blockchain technology is that once your house is on the blockchain, and there are many decentralized nodes maintaining the ledger, then the bank that issued the script no longer needs to be trusted. Here\u2019s how this would work. Let\u2019s say you wanted to take out a loan from the equity you have in your house. You would make a legal agreement that puts your house on the blockchain, with a clause that the title will transfer to your creditors if you don\u2019t pay back your debt. You can then mint your own tokens on the blockchain using your house as collateral. You would pay some trusted intermediary to get the asset on the blockchain, but once it is on the blockchain, then there is a contract that says, \u201cI can\u2019t sell my house without paying back all the tokens I took out.\u201d You can then go trade those tokens for other tokens or fiat or another commodity that you think is a better use of that capital. And you, the individual, aren\u2019t paying interest because there is no trusted third party like a bank. You are taking out the loan from yourself, so you don\u2019t need to pay yourself interest like you would pay a bank if you took out a mortgage. If you\u2019re looking for more about blockchain and cryptocurrency for business, click here to access my personal resource lists of where I\u2019ve found the best and most reliable information. This same mechanism could be done for all asset-backed lending. All $700 trillion of the valued assets in the world could be converted into asset-backed currency, creating much more liquidity and increasing the velocity of money to the edges of the network where it is most needed, like the African coffee farmer. Imagine the coffee farmer knows she can increase her crop yield by 30% if she can buy a new piece of equipment. Right now, she can\u2019t get access to capital to invest in that equipment. However, if she could take out a loan on the blockchain against her existing farm, she could buy that new piece of equipment, increase her yield, and pay back the loan from her increased profits. This would enable commerce to happen without possession of fiat currency, which is scarce relative to the total value of assets. The transparency of the blockchain would also remove a large amount of risk to capital providers. The entity loaning money for the new piece of farm equipment can already see on the blockchain an order from Starbucks to buy the coffee, so that they can lend at a much lower rate because of commensurately lower risk. The blockchain collapses the space between the map and the territory. Because the blockchain (map) so accurately reflects the real world (territory), you can more safely operate on the assumption that the two are the same, so capital providers need a much smaller risk premium to lend. Given that the supply chain industry represents $54 trillion in annual GDP globally, even mild improvements have big implications on the creation of wealth globally. The ability to give low or no-interest rate asset-backed loans would significantly impact the structure of the global economy. It would allow small businesses in the developed world to become more competitive and create more jobs. Most significantly, it would allow the fringes of the supply chain network in developing countries to invest in their own businesses and pull themselves out of poverty.

[1] The whole centralization premise is based on stable environments, what Nassim Taleb would call Mediocristan. For example, the centralization of production is based on the thesis that you can spend a ton of money building a factory because you will continue to get a return on your investment (ROI) for 40 years with minimal additional reinvestment. The centralization of capital is based on the idea that you can identify obvious ways to deploy that capital, but those ways are changing faster, which makes it harder for a single individual or small group of individuals to accurately identify. The centralization of risk is based on the belief that you can divide up the risk between other corporations and cancel each other out. [2] But why is there less money than valued assets? Historically there was both soft and hard currency. The most common forms of hard currency were gold and silver. Soft currency was what you would use day to day, like the farmer taking her crop to the pharaoh and getting a hieroglyphic tablet with a record of the transaction which could then be traded for shoes or a table or whatever she needed. This system continued well into the Middle Ages. The soft currency provided the liquidity and the hard currency provided the fungibility and store of value.By the end of the 18th century, most major nations collapsed these into one currency backed by national governments and outlawed other soft currencies.These were collapsed together because government had been only taxing transactions done in specie and so there were all these soft currency transactions that they couldn\u2019t tax, as well as assets that were unvalued. Prior to that there were a lot of assets which were unvalued. A European Lord was granted land by the king for being a good soldier without ever buying it. Or a homesteader in the US got land by just living there so he never had to have money to get the valued asset. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

When I was 12, I was on holiday with my cousins, and one of them pushed me into a swimming pool. I\u2019ve been terrified of water ever since. My hometown, Raqqa, in Syria, did not have many swimming pools, and it\u2019s pretty unusual for children to learn how to swim. Sometimes we would go to the lake at Ja\u2019aber castle near Raqqa with my family on weekends or to Lattakia on the coast for holidays, but I would never try to swim. I always stayed near the shore. I had made the decision to try to leave Syria but didn\u2019t have much of a plan of where to go or how to get there. My father wasn\u2019t keen, but in the end so many people we knew had left that we somehow got used to the idea. I had thought of going to the UK because I could speak English well and knew something of the country, but it seemed so far away. Most of my information came from other Syrians who were also planning to leave for Europe. They knew how to prepare for the sea crossing and said that you could call the coast guard to come and pick you up. The people who really knew how to get to Europe were the men who started working as smugglers. They were said to know all the best routes to get across the Syrian border to Turkey, across Turkey to the coast, and then on to Greece or Italy by boat. I was told that if you paid these smugglers, they could get you all the way there. I knew it involved crossing the Mediterranean Sea. If you\u2019ve never had to find a people smuggler, you might think they are quite hard to find. I thought so. But once you start asking, you\u2019d be surprised how many there are. Talking about leaving and how to do it had become a common topic in Syria, especially in border towns like Kobane. I heard a guy in a bakery shop in Kobane talking about a woman who had left, so I asked him if he knew someone that could get me over the border. He gave me the name of Mohammed Khoja. The Turkish border was a half-hour walk from Kobane. Friends told me that in the past two or three years, Turkey had built very high fences with barbed wire to keep Syrians out and had soldiers, with guns, patrolling the border. When I first called Mohammed, he said he would pay one border guard so that I could cross safely. I had no way of knowing if he was telling the truth, if he really would pay the border guard. But I had already decided to put my soul in his hands, and it seemed a less painful choice than continuing to live with the risk of being killed at knifepoint or buried under rubble in Kobane. That is what I thought. I remember Mohammed now. He didn\u2019t look like a bad person\u200a\u2014\u200acertainly not how I expected a people smuggler to look. Like me, he was a Syrian Kurd, and he brought his son with him when he met me, so he seemed nice. Normal, somehow. As if taking a large amount of money from desperate people was the most normal job in the world. He said he would help 10 people cross into Turkey and that he charged $300 per person to cross this narrow no-man\u2019s land. Just before I left Kobane, I had a bit of a lucky break. When I went to my aunt\u2019s house, a Norwegian journalist named Anders Hammer was there interviewing my cousin. His translator was struggling a little, so I jumped in instead, and when he asked if I was planning to leave Syria, I told him my plan. I wanted to document the whole journey to Europe on my phone, I said. But Anders had a better idea\u200a\u2014\u200ahe gave me a small GoPro video camera with about four hours of recording time and spent several days teaching me how to use it. Eventually Anders directed and produced the whole film, so we were able to document the whole trip. I was often asked during the journey why I was filming everything. I always said the same thing: The real story about escaping a war zone needs to be told by the people who have done it. All of us have the right to tell our own stories. They should come from us. Much of the coverage I saw on TV or on social media misrepresented us. They called refugees \u201cmigrants\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aas if we had a choice, as if we were moving just to try to make some money or scrounge some benefits. So I wanted to tell my own story, to be the narrator of my own escape. Coming to Europe was not a dream that came true; it was about me finding a way to survive and live with dignity. It took four attempts, over the course of a month, to get into Turkey. Each time, I said goodbye to my family with fear and sadness in my heart. The half-hour walk to the border seemed longer, my footsteps seemed heavier, and something in me wanted me to stop and go back to them and give up the whole idea. We had heard that Turkish border guards were shooting and beating people and had beaten an old woman and her husband. I didn\u2019t think they would hurt old people or children, but they did. There were no rules on that border. With each attempt, the smuggler took our group to the fence, in the dark, and we would squeeze under the barbed wire and start running to the other side. That was the only instruction we were given\u200a\u2014\u200arun to the other side and someone will be waiting for you. We just had to run for our lives. (It made me think of something they\u2019d do in a Tom Cruise action movie, but it\u2019s not as fun when it\u2019s happening to you in real life.) The first time, we were caught, and they just walked us back across the border to Syria. The second time, we saw border guards and ran back. The third time, the soldiers were there with a tank, and we turned and ran back again. It was around February 1, 2016, when I tried for the fourth and last time. I didn\u2019t say a big goodbye to my family because I thought I\u2019d probably be coming back again. I didn\u2019t even hug them much. It was nightfall when I left for the border again, hoping not to get beaten even more than I hoped to cross. I left home on my own and was crossing with a small group of people I had not met before that included a mother and her children and some other young people. We all made it across the border. We headed for a group of trees on an empty street, where a van driver was waiting for us. He took us to the nearest bus station so we could choose where to go from there. That was not the case for everybody; I heard stories of some people who had to run and hide in a cornfield until the border guards stopped chasing them, so to have a car waiting for us seemed almost a luxury. And that was because we had paid Mohammed, the smuggler. I caught a bus to the city of Urfa, where I was reunited with my 80-year-old grandmother, Farida. I stayed with her for a few weeks. She had been in Urfa since June 25, 2015, just after ISIS had told all Kurds to leave the city of Raqqa. She had left with my uncle and my little sister Sara, who had lived with her since my mother died in 2004. My best friend Yakeen was also in Urfa; our mothers had been good friends, and we grew up together. She\u2019d been there since she escaped Syria in 2014. I waited for my father to send me some money and then met up with another old friend called Ayman. He had his own horror story. Ayman had been an activist in the Syrian revolution and had to drop out of university after being detained and tortured by the al-Assad regime. Then he had to escape Raqqa after getting threats from ISIS, and though he didn\u2019t want to leave, he had no choice. Almost every other activist in the city had been kidnapped, killed, or already escaped. Ayman and I decided to travel together and planned to take the 12-hour bus ride to the coastal city of Izmir, where many of the smugglers\u2019 boats left for the Greek islands. The smugglers\u2019 network is like a spider\u2019s web, all connected to each other. Mohammed had given me the name of a Turkish guy who does the sea smuggling. And those guys are the worst. The Syrian ones don\u2019t kill you\u200a\u2014\u200athey don\u2019t care if you get shot by the border guard, but they wouldn\u2019t kill you themselves. But the Turkish ones, if you refuse to do as they say, you will get shot. It was March 2, 2016, when we arrived in Izmir, on the western coast of Turkey, and we were met by someone calling himself Orhan. He was short, in his mid-forties, and dressed in a smart suit with gelled-back hair. He seemed quite polite and said he\u2019d get his men to drive us to the coast and organize a rubber dinghy for the journey to Greece. One of Orhan\u2019s men drove a big group of us to the coast in the back of a large white cargo van. We were told to meet the driver at 9 p.m., but we waited there for hours and didn\u2019t leave until 3 a.m. There were almost 60 of us stuffed in the back for two hours, with the dinghy and the motor, and only one small window. We could hardly breathe. I don\u2019t know exactly where they took us, but it was somewhere near Izmir, on a rocky beach with lots of trees. When we arrived at the shore at 5 a.m., we were met by six scary-looking guys who looked like mafia. I knew the smugglers on the shore would be the scary ones, and they were\u200a\u2014\u200aall very big, like bodybuilders, and each carrying a gun on their belt. They did that deliberately\u2014they wore their guns like a threat. Some were shirtless and some wore vests, even though it was winter and chilly in the early morning air. Ayman and I each handed over $800 in cash to one of the men. I got the money from selling my mother\u2019s jewelry. She had given me a necklace and bracelet just before she died, and though I said I\u2019d never wear them, she told me I should keep them in case I needed the money someday. So I sold them, and a bracelet and earrings she gave my sisters, to pay the smugglers. The men started shouting orders at everyone. They told us only to take small, important things with us, like backpacks and life jackets, and made us leave everything else on the beach. I had a life buoy I had to leave behind, but when they weren\u2019t looking I reached back and picked it up again. It was 6 a.m. now, overcast and very cold. There were two boats leaving that night, including ours, which would be all Syrian Kurds. The men said we would leave in the dinghy at 7 a.m. and told us to put lifejackets on. They asked some of the men who were with us to help them prepare the boats. The rest of us waited. When 7 a.m. came and it was time to leave for the sea, I began to have a panic attack. I could barely speak for fear. Ayman knew what I was feeling and tried to reassure me that it would be fine. The sea is calm today, he said. We will make it. We started boarding the boat. It was built to carry 15 people, but 52 people were put into the boat, including six small children and babies. The smuggler had told us 25 people would be on the boat, but we weren\u2019t surprised that he had lied. A smuggler, to me, is a criminal who benefits from other people\u2019s misery. Everything they do is for money. We had been on the boat for two hours when it began taking on water and started to sink. It is impossible to describe just how much panic you feel when all around you there is only water and the only thing you can hear is children crying. The mothers were trying to calm their children, but there was only terror. The hours on that boat felt like an eternity. I felt frozen, not with cold, but with fear. I couldn\u2019t move, or breathe, or talk\u200a\u2014\u200aI was terrified of drowning, of dying. Yet the argument was still racing through my mind\u200a\u2014\u200awhy did I have to go through this? Why couldn\u2019t I just take my passport, and my things, and take a plane to another country like so many other people in the world? As I sat there, frozen, so crammed against everyone else that I couldn\u2019t move my legs, I remembered how I used to think that there could be nothing worse than dying in an airstrike. Yet this did feel worse. I felt weak, unknown, a true victim of the world. I felt like someone nobody cared about. The boat kept going in circles. The driver had no idea where to go. All I could hear around me was people saying: This went on for an hour. And I began to think of my beautiful sisters and lovely father, and how they cried when I told them I wanted to leave. How I hadn\u2019t been able to tell them I was crossing in the boat today, because I knew that if I told my father, he would not sleep the night from worrying. And how I wished I had told them. How I wished I had said goodbye. As I was saying goodbye in my mind, someone saw a ship in the distance. It turned out to be a Greek navy ship. It was half an hour before it rescued us, because they had to wait until we drifted out of Turkish waters. I felt weak with relief and happiness when that ship finally approached. They pulled alongside and threw a rope to us. Slowly, they began helping people on board, women and children first, backpacks in a pile in the middle, women on one side of the ship and men on the other. I was so grateful, but I felt like they were only following orders. If they hadn\u2019t been told to save us, maybe they would have left us there, in the sea. They told us to shut down our phones and not to move. I saw a boy of about 16 still using his phone, probably because he couldn\u2019t understand English or because he was telling a relative that he had been rescued. Hide your phone, I thought to myself, hide your phone. But one of the soldiers saw him and kicked him and threw his phone into the sea. He kept kicking him until another soldier told him to stop. I couldn\u2019t hold back my tears. We were on the navy ship for about six hours. We weren\u2019t sure where we would be taken, so I asked one of the friendlier soldiers where we were going. \u201cYonan,\u201d he answered, which means Greece in Arabic. And later that afternoon, we arrived on the island of Lesbos. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out. Syrian Kurd refugee, aged 22.

Recently, it seems the speed of development and the growth of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) businesses resulted in an explosion of \u201cproduct\u201d companies over \u201cplatform\u201d companies. In my estimation, the growth of \u201cproduct\u201d companies is a result of the amazing success of several \u201cplatform\u201d companies who have opened their architecture to allow outside innovation due to their scale. There are multiple ways to describe \u201cproduct\u201d companies and \u201cplatform\u201d companies, so let me clarify how I see the two. First, a \u201cproduct\u201d company is one that sells a particular type of solution to a problem across a specific sector or type of industry. In contrast, \u201cplatform\u201d companies seek to transform industries or sectors with a set of solutions and products. Products lack defensibility and often rely on other platforms for customer acquisition, data, or infrastructure. Conversely, platforms allow new products built at a significantly lower incremental cost and users pay for the new value offered versus just paying for consuming more of a service. The pricing page of a company will likely show you whether they have built a product or a platform as a product company will charge by the number of users while a platform will price according to the increasing value the products provide to the customer. Further, there seems to be a push from some early-stage investors, advisors, and boards to focus on building product companies because the pipeline and customer acquisition model is more predictable. While this may create some risk mitigation, the focus results in limiting the upside potential of an investment. It also encourages capital allocation to be deployed towards product development and not platform growth. The result is a lack of focus on architecture and a desire to focus solely on selling specific products. There is an excellent discussion on \u201cPipe Thinking\u201d and \u201cPlatform Thinking\u201d at Platform Thinking Labs. While \u201cproduct\u201d companies can be incredibly successful, I find most founders achieve product-market-fit early and seek to scale this solution. However, with the growth of software and the low cost to build new products, the need to identify founder-market-fit is increasingly needed to create new and sustainable companies. Founders should have a passion for transforming an industry, and while many previously worked in those sectors, others bring a view that delivering innovation in technology or business model will be transformative. To better illustrate why companies should focus on building a platform strategy, I created several charts to explain the concept and underlying premise. First, and fundamental to my core assertion is that pricing directly correlates to the value received by the user. If you are familiar with value-based pricing, this is the core underlying belief. The graph below quite merely states that the more complex a problem that receives a solution, the more a customer is willing to pay. In practical terms, this means that customers are willing to pay much less for storage per user than the price they would pay for having a full content and workflow management solution. If you are building a commodity service, then the market has to be substantially large enough that you can charge a minimal amount across millions of users. However, if you are building an industry-changing platform company, then you need to be able to provide solutions that address more complex problems by your customers. When building a platform company, you need a strong foundation of technology, processes, and people so you can increase the Average Revenue Per Customer. The below chart shows the relationship between the production costs associated with building a platform to solve challenges for customers. If it is a solution that addresses minimally complex problems, the cost is lower and the maximum value received is lower. For more complex challenges, the cost to build a new platform is more significant, and customers will pay more for the value they are receiving. While on the production side, each new feature added costs significantly less to build. If built with customer-focused releases, there should be minimally viable products that customers want though they do not wholly solve a problem. This value is often when a product brings technology to a business but does not address the core process or technology associated with solving the problem in an industry. From an investor perspective, the Platform Funding Gap causes the core rift between founders and investors. The cost to build a platform is expensive, but there is the tremendous opportunity for Value Creation and Acceleration on top of the platform where the cost to build each new feature is less than the initial features. Founders have solutions to minimize the Platform Funding Gap, but we as investors often discourage some of those methods. I want to make the following case why investors should look at alternative revenue sources in companies building a platform and reinforce the benefit of having founder-market fit. First, the typical advice given to companies is they should be laser-focused on building their product and getting user growth and traction. Most metrics point to this, and often the founders also want to be focused on building products. If the founder has sufficient capital or a minimally viable set of products that when delivered at scale can fill the funding gap, then stay focused. However, if you are a startup not in Silicon Valley or want to remain focused on transforming an industry over fundraising, then perhaps the following will be more helpful. Second, having strong Founder-Market-Fit provides a company with the knowledge and understanding to work with a small set of customers to solve their complex problems. The pricing and approach for this are not product-driven, it is much more customized and built with alongside the customer and gets grouped as professional services. WHAT?!!! Did I just say professional services? consulting?!!! We don\u2019t invest in lifestyle companies!!! We only invest in companies built to scale into massive markets with a product that everyone wants!!! Let me be clear, I am not advocating building a professional services company, but I do believe professional services are a reliable revenue source that increases a company\u2019s understanding of the market. Further, professional services companies can be viable companies and we should not be afraid of building sustainable businesses as entrepreneurs and founders while also looking over the horizon to the future. While Paul Graham talks about doing things that do not scale, I disagree that companies should not use it as a source of revenue. Companies should never be afraid to require customers to pay for services where they receive value. An ancillary benefit for the founders who came from the industry the company focuses is their passion often comes from working on significant problems and challenges for the industry. They are thought leaders and seek to be transformative, and the relationships they build will drive the marquee customers that provide referential value for the company. The graph above highlights where there is the opportunity to build non-platform services that will most likely be people getting paid for providing one-time services, i.e., professional services. Early in the lifecycle of a company, the services may each be customized, but as the company progresses, the company may choose to use services to fill in the gaps where the platform has yet to be entirely built, e.g., installation and integration services. At some point, the company will get to what I call the Platform Crossover Point. This point is where the professional services should be phased out of the company and the focus should move from the exploration of the business model and focus exclusively on adding users to the platform. During this phase, the most value is created, and new features and products developed at such speed that new customer segments begin to emerge on the platform. Often this results in new features being added to the platform that many users do not use, but sufficiently large customer segments. The next major inflection point is the Complexity Crossover Point. This point is where adding new features or solving new problems gets to the point of irreducible complexity or perhaps more clinically where the cost of development on the platform exceeds the value a customer is willing to pay. These complex areas become interesting when thinking about new products, platforms, and services to be offered by companies and the ecosystem of partners a platform develops. They are also areas where new technologies may change or be enhanced by the platform a company created. My goal with this article is to give founders and investors a new lens to think about how to build companies that can be more sustainable and also built with greater capital efficiency. Companies that focus on delivering increasing value to customers will have the culture to sustain and innovate for the long term. They will be companies that will never let a platform languish, and the employees will have a cult-like focus on using the platform to transform an industry because no one builds a cult-like following just trying to sell a product.

In fact, hyperactivity and inattentiveness might actually be the least of our worries, as the biological issues related to the ADHD brain also directly effects executive function. These are the skills that help us self-regulate, manage time, plan, and organize; and when they are weak, we lose track of our goals and fail to accomplish tasks no matter how important they are to us or our loved ones. In order to combat these weak executive function skills and still move forward, we\u2019ve got to create structures outside of our ADHD brain to keep us on task. These basic techniques will help guide us to greater productivity: Take a simple step-by-step approach to projects and work. Those of us with ADHD have a hairpin trigger between an idea and it\u2019s execution that often leaves us frustrated, in over our heads, or unprepared to accomplish what we desired. We often see the completed project without realizing what it\u2019s completion entails The best solution is to \u201cready-aim-fire.\u201d Prior to starting a project, plan out specifically the steps and resources it takes to bring the work to completion. Visually working through a projection prior to starting is necessary to combatting these issues. Plan for everything to take twice as long as you think. I always seem to think I can accomplish more than is possible in any given time frame, whether it\u2019s a creative endeavor or merely doing household chores. Stopping and evaluating a task\u2019s actual time required is crucial to completing it without frustration. Respect travel times and potential hang ups to avoid missing deadlines or having to stop in the middle of a project before you\u2019re finished with the work. Rely on technology and visual reminders. We lack a good working memory, a hallmark sign of ADHD as evidenced by our constant inability to find our keys or wallets. Fortunately our phones, tablets and computers are now capable of taking care of a vast majority of these problems. Use daily reminders, alarms, and appointment reminders to force yourself to respect a schedule that pushes you to complete tasks and start projects when they are required. Write everything down you hope to accomplish and review it daily. Aside from the dopamine boost of checking off goals and tasks propelling you forward, we need a constant visual reminder of what we desire to complete throughout our day, week, or month. ADHD brains exist in a \u201cnow\u201d or \u201cnot now\u201d state,\u201d we can\u2019t count on ourselves to remind us of our priorities. Visual reminders keep us from falling off track with the daily whims of our hyperactive or inattentive minds. It\u2019s important we give ourselves grace as we address our weaknesses. For far too man of us, weak executive function skills has already lead us to a constant sense of failure, don\u2019t let this shame and self-doubt get in the way of moving forward and avoiding future failures by inaction. No matter the outcome, be gentle with yourself and keep moving forward with the goal of progress, not perfection. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

You\u2019re not alone. I felt like this every day for a long time. Whenever I jump on a first coaching call, this sentence is uttered. The past decade has given us plenty of tools and software dedicate to increasing productivity. Yet, we\u2019re more overwhelmed than ever. We spend our 24 hours chasing the next task off an infinite list, like someone determined to sweep the sea away using a broom. Productivity isn\u2019t doing more. It\u2019s producing more. But to produce more, you need to understand the bigger picture.Where are you going? Is the next task going to fit in the final puzzle? When you feel overwhelmed, the secret to getting more done is to stop doing.Just stop whatever you\u2019re doing, and go for a walk. Busyness and procrastination are siblings.You may think they\u2019re unrelated. Mortal enemies. But the easiest way to avoid working on something meaningful (and scary), is getting lost working on something pointless, comfortable, and possibly without a clear end. There\u2019s a thin line between procrastination and meaningful work, but it can be the difference between running breathless on a treadmill and walking leisurely to a clear destination.

An author wrote, \u201cAn editor who was considering my work commented very thoroughly on my body type as a possible personal advantage of working with me.\u201d For her now, \u201cit makes submissions feel like a minefield.\u201d For an author/illustrator, it was at a book party with a famous illustrator; \u201cI introduce myself to him,\u201d she writes, \u201cand he makes a crack about my breasts.\u201d After enough incidents like these she\u2019s \u201ccompletely stopped socializing in this business because each time it becomes another abuse story.\u201d Sometimes the comments are more pointed, like for the publicist who says her supervisor told her he had a crush on her and if he wasn\u2019t married and twice her age he would ask her out. Or a writer\u2019s conference attendee who says that a faculty member asked her if she was \u201ckinky\u201d at the opening mixer. Or the aspiring illustrator who won a mentorship contest, and at the end of her meeting with the mentor she said she had to go get a drink of water because she was hot. According to her, \u201che said \u2018Yes, you are.\u2019 And squeezed my arm. And raised his eyebrows in a suggestive way.\u201d These are the sort of events we\u2019re told to brush off\u200a\u2014\u200athey\u2019re jokes, they\u2019re flattering, no big deal. But when you believe you are a professional and someone informs you they see you as a sex object, it can shatter your sense of self and your sense of safety. Sometimes, it\u2019s inappropriate touching and groping: as in \u201ca senior editor of a division I don\u2019t work in being a tad too handsy;\u201d or the author who says another author groped her while taking pictures at a conference; or an agent who says she was sitting in the backseat with a bestselling author during a conference, and as he pretended to be searching for his seatbelt, he fondled her. Sometimes, it\u2019s stories of women being invited to a networking opportunity only to get propositioned; or of male conference faculty and staff acting like all female paying attendees are potential and willing conquests; or of powerful men trying to ruin the reputations of women who won\u2019t sleep with them. And sometimes, the stories reveal serial predators unchecked by an industry that does not want to acknowledge such things could be possible of its men. We work in children\u2019s books, and we like to think we are different, somehow. We value \u201ckindness.\u201d The ranks of publishers are populated with women. And everyone is so nice, right? But we aren\u2019t different, and before we can do anything about sexual harassment, we need to face that reality. And the reality is that a culture of \u201ckindness\u201d can silence people who have been harassed, that women can be complicit in a culture of sexual harassment and gender discrimination, and that the people who we work alongside, whose books we care about, who we like, can be sexual harassers. Facing this reality is going to be ugly. But it is far uglier to pretend these problems aren\u2019t here. In December, I opened a survey about sexual harassment in children\u2019s publishing, inspired by Kelly Jensen\u2019s work on sexual harassment in libraries. I received almost 90 responses, as well as emails and DMs from people who didn\u2019t want to fill out the survey because they felt too ashamed, or were still frightened of reprisal. This is not intended to be some kind of lurid expos\u00e9 of children\u2019s publishing. The point of it isn\u2019t to say that our industry is somehow special; the point is simply that we do have problems, that these problems affect people\u2019s careers and mental health, and that we can and should take steps to solve these problems so more people do not get hurt. Most of the survey responses I received were about men harassing women, and so that will be the focus of this particular essay, though not all responses here necessarily reflect that dynamic. (I used self-identifying remarks as well as context to determine gender.) But I hope as the current conversation continues issues of harassment of people in the LGBTQIAP community will come to light. Nor do I have specific examples of the way racial and gender discrimination intersect for women (and trans and gender non-conforming people) of color, but that too is a conversation that must be had. (For the record, I had two responses that specifically mentioned women as harassers\u200a\u2014\u200aone female author verbally harassing another, and one editor who propositioned a male writer at a conference. I am aware of anecdotes of straight white women acting entitled to the bodies of gay men and men of color, but these issues did not appear in the survey responses.) I asked people to keep their responses anonymous and not to name names specifically\u200a\u2014\u200abecause I wanted the focus to be on the stories themselves, and because once names are involved people start defending the harassers and accusing the harassed, and in addition to the harm done to them and those who have yet to speak, it stops the conversation before it starts. I have eliminated some identifying details from the quotes. I also have redacted names of organizations and conferences in responses for the same reason. I am not a journalist, just an author who cares deeply about this industry, the people in it, and the audience we serve. This is an anonymous survey, and there is no way for me to verify the stories; it is entirely possible that someone submitted a false entry in order to derail this project, as this is, after all, the internet. This is not about exposing or accusing people; speculating on the identities of the alleged harassers would be damaging to everyone involved, and will only feed derailing narratives. The responsibility for dealing with known harassers is on the institutions that have received complaints. The point of this survey is to paint a picture of sexual harassment in our industry so we can begin to address it. The two biggest groups of respondents were creators (people who described themselves as authors/writers/illustrators) and conference attendees/staff. About a fifth of the respondents worked in publishing houses, while others were agents, booksellers, librarians, and one was a graduate student. Responses reveal, in general, three loci for sexual harassment: in the workplace; at conferences and book festivals; and in the professional spaces where spheres of the industry intersect (author to bookseller, agent to author, etc, editor to agent, etc.) All three categories seem to require different solutions, so I will be discussing each separately. I am writing up some of the responses here, but this is just a representative sample. What is Sexual Harassment? Our cultural focus recently has been on horrific stories of sexual assault, so it is important to remember that sexual harassment isn\u2019t just about assault, but about any unwelcome sexual overtures, physical or verbal. The law against sexual harassment in workplaces reads, in part: It is unlawful to harass a person (an applicant or employee) because of that person\u2019s sex. Harassment can include \u201csexual harassment\u201d or unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature. Harassment does not have to be of a sexual nature, however, and can include offensive remarks about a person\u2019s sex. For example, it is illegal to harass a woman by making offensive comments about women in general. The law falls under employment law, and it exists not just to protect against sexual assault, which is a crime; sexual harassment has a broader umbrella and is considered a civil rights violation\u200a\u2014\u200abecause unwelcome sexual advances, verbal or physical, can affect a woman\u2019s ability to work and can cause professional harm. In her essay on the accusations of sexual harassment and bullying of women against public radio\u2019s John Hockenberry, Suki Kim writes: Both [bullying women and sexual aggression] can create what is defined in sexual harassment law as a \u2018hostile work environment.\u2019 And with the lurid details coming at us so fast and furious these days, it can be easy to forget that sexual harassment is a form of illegal workplace discrimination. The law against it is intended to allow women to do their jobs and pursue their professional goals with the same freedom as men. In New York Magazine, Rebecca Traister cautions us against making category errors in our conversations about sexual harassment\u200a\u2014\u200athat the non-physical, verbal come-ons, disparaging comments about women, objectifying comments are all sexual harassment too: How to make clear that the trauma of the smaller trespasses\u200a\u2014\u200athe boob grabs and unwanted kisses or come-ons from bosses\u200a\u2014\u200ais not necessarily even about the sexualized act in question; so many of us learned to maneuver around handsy men without sustaining lasting emotional damage when we were 14. Rather, it\u2019s about the cruel reminder that these are still the terms on which we are valued, by our colleagues, our bosses, sometimes our competitors, the men we tricked ourselves into thinking might see us as smart, formidable colleagues or rivals, not as the kinds of objects they can just grab and grope and degrade without consequence. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re horrified like some Victorian damsel; it\u2019s that we\u2019re horrified like a woman in 2017 who briefly believed she was equal to her male peers but has just been reminded that she is not, who has suddenly had her comparative powerlessness revealed to her. It is implicit in the law that sexual harassment creates an environment hostile to women, and while the law itself only applies to employers with over 15 employers, the effect remains the same: Sexual harassment, whether verbal or physical, interferes with women\u2019s careers. And yet the majority of the stories I\u2018ve received in the survey do not fall under the protection of employment law, but they still take place in environments where we do our work of making books for young readers and putting these books in their hands, and the effect on the harassed is still the same\u200a\u2014\u200adamage to their careers, and damage to their mental and physical health. (This is true for both physical and non-physical harassment.) This puts greater onus on institutions\u200a\u2014\u200apublishers, agencies, conference organizations\u200a\u2014\u200ato take action. Thank you so much to everyone who shared their stories. Here are some of them. In the Workplace: Respondents tell stories of male bosses making inappropriate comments, including demeaning comments about women, telling blow job jokes to an office full of women. One editorial assistant says she had to spend three years with a boss who spoke in this manner like this, \u201cjust silently hating this guy,\u201d before she was finally able to quit for another job in publishing. Another editorial assistant reports that she was repeatedly asked out by the head of her department. \u201cWhen I turned him down,\u201d she writes, \u201che became terse with me at work, belittled me in meetings, tried to make others think I wasn\u2019t good at my job\u200a\u2014\u200ait was small stuff but added up to me feeling like crap. Took it for four months, then found a new job.\u201d An editorial director writes, \u201cI was on the way to our weekly acquisition meeting at a major big 5 publisher, to present new titles. The finance director and production director followed me downstairs to the meeting sharing explicit comments about my ass and general fitness for sex. I then had to present potential acquisitions to them.\u201d She did not report the incident, as \u201cno one would listen to me.\u201d \u201cI have a coworker who scopes out all of the new girls at work,\u201d writes a publicist, \u201cincluding the interns. He is in a slight position of power, and asks new girls out to lunch. He asks about their dating status right off the bat, and it is incredibly inappropriate. He reached out to me over FB messenger, and for nearly seven months I pretended I was still with my ex-boyfriend.\u201d She did not report his behavior because it was \u201ckind of an open secret.\u201d She adds, \u201cIt\u2019s made me think twice about reporting things because I find his behavior to be rather obvious\u200a\u2014\u200ahow hasn\u2019t someone corrected it yet?\u201d One woman reports that she had an internship at a prestigious literary agency where for months she was groomed by the office manager, decades older than she. When she was offered a full-time position there, her co-workers took her out for drinks to celebrate. The office manager \u201cinsisted on buying me many drinks, even after I said I no longer wanted any, and put his hand on my leg beneath the table. When I moved my leg away he put his hand back on me. When I made motions to leave he made excuses to keep me there until eventually we were the only two people left at the bar. He kissed me. I pulled away. He asked what my problem was, and I could not find words to answer. I was horrified and in shock.\u201d She says she tried to leave the bar, but was new to the city and didn\u2019t know what part of the city she was in or how to get to a subway station, so he offered to walk her to one. It was after midnight, so she agreed. But he led her to the steps of his brownstone instead. \u201cHe spent several minutes arguing, persuading, insulting, demeaning, flattering, and demanding that I go inside. I refused.\u00a0\u2026 I was terrified. I perceived this person to be very powerful and influential and was afraid to anger him or turn him against me. I never felt comfortable in that job and as a result my work was poor and I left the company much sooner than I otherwise would have.\u201d She adds, \u201cI know for a fact this man did similar things and worse to other women who worked under him.\u201d An editor reports being screamed at and physically intimidated by a male co-worker; she says this was considered a \u201crite of passage\u201d for women in the company. When she complained, \u201cI was told he had been spoken to and if I wanted to pursue it I could meet with him alone in a closed room. Afterward I was further harassed, lied about, and eventually dismissed.\u201d She is glad that issues of abuse and harassment are coming to light now; \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of young women editors flee from places (including at least 4 others from that company) to lower jobs (title or pay) just to escape.\u201d This is exactly what sexual harassment laws are supposed to protect against; but in these cases, as in so many others, it seems that it is the people who have been harassed whose professional goals are suffering, and the result is a talent drain for the industry. Writes one former editor, \u201cSomething that is not being called out yet is the loss of opportunity for the women who don\u2019t play along.\u201d \u201cKidlit is filled with women,\u201d writes another editor, \u201cbut a lot of the senior staff are still men\u2026How many women have left the industry because of hostile work environments who could be running things today? We shouldn\u2019t have to suffer to earn respect.\u201d But for that to happen the companies need to make the safety of women a priority. An editor reports that her boss was physically inappropriate with her. She writes that she discovered that this man had many complaints against him for \u201csexual and other abuses of power/ unreasonable behavior.\u201d But, she adds, \u201cHR said they were powerless to do anything because he was getting results.\u201d At Conferences and Book Festivals: In the children\u2019s book industry there are a number of organizations that sponsor conferences throughout the year that give developing writers and/or illustrators the opportunity to meet with and learn from established authors and illustrators as well as publishing professionals. Most of the responses in this category were about these kinds of conferences, though a few were at book festivals where authors meet the public. An editor writes that at a writing conference she experienced \u201cunwanted touching by older male conference attendees. Several men touched me to stop me in the halls without even speaking first, and one man touched my bare shoulder as I was leaving my lunch table, and then stood between me and the exit, blocking me up against my table, while he touched my shoulder again and asked questions and told me about his book. I tried to leave but he pointedly ignored my physical cues\u2026It was invalidating and frightening to be backed up against a table by a much larger, older man at an event where I was an invited professional.\u201d \u201cI discussed this issue with other female agents and editors,\u201d she says, \u201cand they said they had experienced similar issues that year and previous years\u2026.\u201d She struggled with whether or not to report it, because \u201cI felt somewhat silly reporting something so \u2018minor\u2019 as that and was worried I was overreacting.\u201d She suggests: \u201cMore supervision of the dynamic between conference attendees and industry professionals, an established harassment reporting protocol that is easy to find and follow, consequences for inappropriate behavior at events.\u201d The need for codes of conduct at conferences and book festivals came up again and again. One author who reports sexual aggression from a fellow writer at a book festival notes, \u201cThere was a huge push for SFF conventions, conferences and festivals to have codes of conducts, but I don\u2019t see YA festivals using the same thing. We need public codes of conduct and the expectation and reality that all people at the festivals will be held to that code of conduct.\u201d This author is not the only one who reported sexual harassment from fellow speakers. Another writes that she spent a day on panels with a male author who was, in her words, \u201cweirdly handsy and invasive of space.\u201d At night some of the writers gathered at the bar, and when this woman got up to leave, the author asked for a hug and \u201csince it was a group setting and he seemed to be well-liked (he\u2019s a very, very popular bestselling author) it seemed less awkward just to hug him, even though I got a vibe from him I didn\u2019t like. But I didn\u2019t want to raise a fuss or seem anti social, he\u2019s big deal, there were so many people around, maybe he\u2019s just a really friendly guy, etc etc. So I hugged him. And as I hugged him, he reached up and fondled both my breasts.\u201d She did not report the incident. \u201cHe\u2019s a very, very successful author and I\u2019m not, and I didn\u2019t think anyone would care or believe me. I worried it sounded made-up, like I would just be trying to get attention or attack a powerful man for the sake of it.\u201d That woman is a published author appearing on panels, and she still did not feel comfortable reporting the assault to anyone due to the stature of the author. For aspiring writer/illustrators at conferences those dynamics are intensified exponentially. The troubling dynamic between powerful, popular male authors/illustrators aggressively looking initiate sexual encounters with female conference attendees came up again and again in responses. One writers\u2019 conference attendee describes male faculty who are \u201cnotorious for sleeping with attendees.\u201d She says: \u2026People need to realize they are in positions of power. It isn\u2019t just faculty, editors, agents. At conferences, people who are published writers/illustrators are held in esteem by those who are not, too. I don\u2019t think it should have to be said because we\u2019re all adults, but people on faculty should not attempt to have romantic encounters with attendees. There is nothing wrong with sex between consenting adults, but there are power dynamics at play here. The most common trend in these responses were of male faculty/staff at writing conferences harassing attendees. And for some of these men, it seems to be a culture. \u201cI\u2019ve been harassed by NYT bestseller males,\u201d said one frequent writing conference attendee. \u201cThis is not a one man problem but I got the feeling he/they thought they were entitled to harass female authors because of their publishing status.\u201d Another writes that when she was new to the industry and at a conference she was introduced to someone on the organization\u2019s board. \u201cI handed the person my business card that had a sticker on it to promote my upcoming book. This person then took the sticker and stuck it on my chest while looking right into my eyes.\u201d Another writer says, \u201cDuring an award ceremony during a conference in Los Angeles, I thought how lucky I was to sit next to a huge bestseller in the children\u2019s industry. Our entire table enjoyed dinner together and near the end he expressed how he\u2019d be interested in reading my work and give feedback. As a newer writer, this was a dream and we exchanged cards. After that, I started to receive messages from him about how beautiful my social media pictures were and that we should get together sometime. He then proceeded to tell me that his wife was fine with it, as she dates other people too. When I told him I was married and declined, he then got upset and pretended to never have met me.\u201d For this writer, \u201cHe made me never want to go back to Los Angeles. This happened years ago, and he made me feel like an object, not a professional.\u201d This is one of the effects of this kind of harassment; we live in a society centered around powerful men, and thus when a powerful man sees you for who you are you feel validated\u200a\u2014\u200aand then they pull the rug out from under you. He sees you as an object, thus you feel like an object. He treats you as fungible, thus you feel fungible. And ashamed for ever thinking you were something else in the first place. As Jia Tolentino writes in the New Yorker: [T]his is a basic and familiar pattern: a powerful man sees you, a woman who is young and who thinks she might be talented, a person who conveniently exists in a female body, and he understands that he can tie your potential to your female body, and threaten the latter, and you will never be quite as sure of the former again. Another woman reports that during a conference a mentor with a leadership position in the parent organization became more and more physical with her, and she did not report it because, \u201cI felt like I would sound stupid and whiny if I said that a [mentor] who I thought was genuinely interested in my career started touching my arms and back.\u201d This sort of harassment leaves the recipients feeling foolish for ever thinking someone might be interested in their abilities. In the introduction, I mentioned a woman who tells a story of winning a mentorship contest with a mentor who closed the meeting with a sexually suggestive comment. She said, \u201cI\u2019d see him at conferences and he\u2019d make \u2018eyes\u2019 at me. I began to wonder. If I\u2019d won because he wanted to have sex. It really devalued the enjoyment I\u2019d have gotten from the win.\u201d She did not report it at the time, but says, \u201cI think I should have said something. I think people in power positions should have training on how not to abuse that power. Not to use these gatherings as opportunities to \u2018hook up\u2019.\u201d Just as workplace harassment affects opportunities for women, so does harassment at conferences for aspiring children\u2019s book creators. An illustrator says of the man she reports harassed her, \u201cHe hosted out of town gatherings for illustrators to chat etc. He\u2019d have industry professionals come to them also. People like agents, even publishers. People who could advance my career. But, because of his constant flirting and sexual innuendo, I didn\u2019t attend one event. I feel like I missed valuable opportunities to connect with other mentees and professionals.\u201d It is often the promise of these opportunities that entrap women in the first place. One woman tells a story of an encounter with an author who is, in her words, \u201cnow a powerful, charismatic, popular writer\u200a\u2014\u200awell known in kidlit and many hold him in high esteem, never guessing what he really is\u200a\u2014\u200athe sneakiest kind of sexual predator. He preys on married women who want to be published.\u201d She says she met him online and they started corresponding, and he invited her to be his guest at a writers\u2019 conference: He led me to believe I was talented and very special. He seemed to take an interest in my writing, and we became more and more intimate over technology. He couldn\u2019t wait to meet in person, so he could introduce me to editors and agents and ultimately be alone with me. I couldn\u2019t wait to be around his energy! It was a great conference. But, thank god, I was able to extricate myself from a physical relationship before getting really screwed over emotionally. We agreed we\u2019d be \u2018just friends\u2019. Their correspondence faded, she continues, and the next year when she went to the conference, the author was \u201cweird and standoffish:\u201d His group of people acted weird to me. One told me get the hell away from them\u2026I didn\u2019t know it at the time but he spread lies about me to every author, agent and editor who was around him at that 2nd conference. He told people I was a crazy stalker. He told people I had threatened him. He tried to get me thrown out of the conference. In reality, he had moved on to another female author (and actually several) and did not want me to compare stories with them. Since the #metoo thing, I have been finding out over the past few months that he has done this same thing to more than 2 dozen other women over the past 10 years. These women share a similar story with me. Some left marriages for this guy. Some tried to commit suicide. His tricks are covert sexual innuendo, casual seduction, games, promises to leave his wife! and then he moves on to a new woman leaving others devastated and left wondering\u2026 She did report it, and she says the incident was \u2018handled,\u2019 and that she cannot say more. But she is still confronted with seeing his name and his books everywhere, and every time she does \u201cI feel sick and cheated.\u201d As for her, she quit the organization and does not write anymore. Another illustrator told a story of an encounter with someone high up in a conference organization that she calls Mr. X. During her first conference, Mr. X offered to review her portfolio at the bar. \u201cMy creep-o-meter was up,\u201d she writes, \u201cbut he was in an authority position, and I badly wanted to improve my craft, so I accepted. And while he did review my portfolio and that was helpful, he also asked me questions about my personal life, going as far as to suggest I had married the wrong man, and that I should come visit him at his studio.\u201d Later, she tried to avoid him: I\u2019d heard that someone had overheard Mr. X saying to another man, \u2018If you don\u2019t get laid at this conference, there is something wrong with you.\u2019\u201d He creeped out one of her friends so badly by being aggressive on social media that she has refused to come to the conference since. She writes that at a later conference, Mr. X chatted her up on the way down to the hotel bar. I thought, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m older now. Maybe this weird semi-come-on stuff is over, and maybe he can just treat me like a human being now.\u201d So I tried having a normal conversation. And within a minute, he told me that I\u2019 d been in the running for a mentee position for a couple of years now, that he\u2019d been trying to tell me at the last conference but that I\u2019d been avoiding him. And what could I say? I told him that I was really excited to hear that, and I wondered what was holding my work back from winning the award. He didn\u2019t answer, just had a smile on his face, and then sat next to me at the bar. Uninvited\u2026. I now know I\u2019m NOT the only person he\u2019s made uncomfortable. And I\u2019m worried that someone else who maybe isn\u2019t as wary of creepers might actually go for his lines, might think that maybe if they\u2019re nicer to him, then they\u2019ll get an in for an award. Like a casting couch sort of situation. I don\u2019t know. But I emailed a male friend of mine who had won the portfolio showcase, telling him about what Mr. X had said to me about getting close to getting a Mentorship, and he said, \u201cNot to be rude, but Mr. X is pretty well-known for using his clout to get lady action.\u201d Which confirms my suspicion that this was just a line. With the support and encouragement of friends, she decided to report him. After all, this has been going on probably since before I even joined [the organization] and nothing has been done about it. Has it been intentionally overlooked, or had NO ONE ever reported Mr. X. on his questionable behavior?\u201d In my survey, she added that after she reported him he was put on probation for a year (couldn\u2019t attend the organization\u2019s events), and had to attend a sexual harassment class. After that he was back, but recently, Mr. X resigned from the organization. As for the illustrator, \u201cThere are a LOT of what ifs involved with my not having attended conferences for nearly 3 years.\u201d At Intersections: Most of the rest of the stories came from moments of intersection between industry groups\u200a\u2014\u200afor instance, the young agent who writes, \u201cI was asked to go to a party and meet editors that could help further my career at a conference in a suite. When I got there the man that invited me said I was the only one that came. The others were late and I was doing so well showing I can be on time. I had a glass of wine and he made advances and I had to leave. He told me I\u2019d never work with his house. I\u2019ve never been able to sell a book there. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s coincidence or not.\u201d For those who work for companies big enough to be covered by employment law, harassment by those they do business with (whether agents, editors, or authors) is actually covered by that law and is an issue for their ownHR\u200a\u2014\u200abut respondents reported a great pressure not to report these incidents in order to preserve a broader working relationship. And some aren\u2019t covered at all. \u201cMy first literary agent was incredibly sexually inappropriate with me,\u201d an author writes. \u201cWhen we finally met in person at a conference, he repeatedly sexually harassed me, made comments about my breasts and told me inappropriate sexual anecdotes. Asked to be invited into my hotel room, so he could give me writing feedback. I was terrified, even after I fired him, that he would try to destroy my career.\u201d She did not report him because she was (and is still) afraid of career repercussions. The bulk of the stories in this category mirror the same issue that came up again and again in conferences\u200a\u2014\u200apowerful male authors or illustrators out on tour harassing booksellers and librarians, or fellow authors. One author reports unwelcome touching and sexual come-ons from the illustrator of her book when they were doing joint events. Some of this, she says, occurred in his car in front of his young child. For her, this made doing those events miserable but \u201cI had to smile and play nice while choking on my bile.\u201d She told her agent and her editor, and asked that she never be paired with him again or have to do events with him again. \u201cBut this happened two years ago and I have hardly written a thing since, though I have had some other heavy life issues that have contributed. However, this experience completely turned me off to my own book because any success it had would be shared with him. It certainly has had a negative effect on my career. I\u2019m so angry.\u201d Sometimes authors struck up email correspondence that turned flirtatious or sexual, and in many cases these advances were difficult to shut down. One bookseller writes of an author flirting with her during an event, then emailing her afterwards. \u201cI misinterpreted his e-mail as being just friendly. After a week or two of e-mailing, he asked me if I would come to see him if he was able to get his publisher to send him to the area again. He wanted to hold my hand, and once he said this I quickly ended the conversation and stopped communicating with him. He is married with children.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t over\u200a\u2014\u200athe bookseller says she saw him again at a conference for independent booksellers. \u201cWhich he took as an opportunity to write to me again and send me short stories, and he would continue to write to me during big book conferences until I told him one of his stories was shit. He never contacted me again after that. I learned later on that he tends to do this to booksellers and librarians, and cozies up to them. I feel fortunate that I never actually went to go meet him, but I also feel incredibly guilty for not saying anything. How many women has he done this to now that he has a larger platform and he is even more beloved?\u201d \u201cA very well-known, married male author tried to get me to have sex with him,\u201d wrote one librarian. \u201cHe was extremely persistent, even after I said no repeatedly. He said he was shocked because no one had ever said no to him before.\u201d \u201cI am a librarian who hired a male author to do an author visit at my library,\u201d says another, \u201cand also, attended a conference where the same author was in attendance. He later contacted me through social media and email and asked to talk to me while he masturbated over the phone. He also asked for pictures.\u201d She is an aspiring author, and is concerned that reporting the behavior would have consequences for her. For booksellers and librarians, so many of them female, the very nature of their job makes them vulnerable to predatory men. Says one bookseller who reports that she was groped by an author/illustrator on tour, \u201cI do think my responsibilities during author events\u200a\u2014\u200aprimarily, to make a good impression on the author on behalf of my store and to play the role of hostess involve power dynamics that might make harassers take advantage of a situation.\u201d \u201cI want to be able to talk about this openly,\u201d says another bookseller, \u201ctell people that it isn\u2019t your fault when someone thinks that you want them. I also think these authors need to be brought out of the dark, and that publishing houses need to stop shielding their authors and stop giving them contracts. His publisher has received several complaints about his behavior and from what I hear, they haven\u2019t done anything about it. He\u2019s still touring. He\u2019s still out there, and there are leagues of women who don\u2019t know what is about to hit them.\u201d Consequences: The hardest thing about reading these responses wasn\u2019t the stories themselves\u200a\u2014\u200athough they are very difficult to read\u200a\u2014\u200ait was the way so many of the women were beating up on themselves: for the fact that this happened to them at all, for not doing something to stop it, for the way they acted and reacted, for the way they still feel. Sexual harassment and abuse turn us all into our own internet comments section, and society has taught us to gaslight ourselves. As Jia Tolentino writes, \u201cEven the slightest brushes I\u2019ve had with men who bait-and-switched their interest in my work and my body have left me feeling that I am, as [alleged Harvey Weinstein victim Asia] Argento felt she was, a fucking fool.\u201d That is one reason many people didn\u2019t report their harassment; they were ashamed of themselves, and they told themselves they were overreacting. People were also scared that there would be career consequences and reprisal, that no one would believe them or care, that if they accused a beloved male creator they would be dismissed and demonized by an entire industry. It is traumatic enough to be sexually harassed. As one respondent said, \u201cTo accuse a man who is loved for beautiful, innocent things\u2026 I\u2019d have been blamed for whatever happened, past, present, future.\u201d Many respondents believed that they would always lose a battle of \u201cmy word against his,\u201d especially as the harassers tended to be popular, powerful. Said the author who reports she was groped during a hug, \u201cIt turned out that this author has a history of harassment and assault, which makes me feel even more complicated about not speaking up at the time. BUT at the same time I\u2019ve told this story to other women authors who have proceeded to defend him because he\u2019s \u2018just so nice\u2019 and was \u2018going through a rough time in his marriage.\u2019 And that reminds me why I didn\u2019t raise hell at the time\u2026I can\u2019t even get other women to see why it was serious and disgusting.\u201d Many women who did not report the harassment are beating up on themselves for it, but the fact that they didn\u2019t feel able to report that harassment is an indictment of our society and our industry and not them. And for those that did, there are very few cases in these responses where reporting harassment had any real consequences for the harasser. (The story of Mr. X\u2019s removal from his organization after #metoo is a rare exception.) Says an editor, \u201cI heard a story about a female author harassed by her male agent\u00a0\u2026 and when the author told the female head of agency about it, the head of agency asked her not to sue them and promised to assign her to another agent, but DID NOT FIRE THE MALE AGENT OR STOP HIS BEHAVIOR, and as far as this author knows, he faced no repercussions other than no longer getting to have her as a client.\u201d One bookseller reports being groped by an author she refers to as \u201cMale Person\u201d during an event at her store: \u201cI called Male Person\u2019s publicist the next day. She thanked me for telling her. A few days later I received a strange email from Male Person that implied his publicist had spoken to her superior, who had a conversation with Male Person\u2019s agent, but did not address anything I had said directly. It felt intimidating, so I didn\u2019t respond.\u201d She is not the only person who reported harassment and had more communication from the harasser inflicted upon her in return. Asking someone to apologize is, perhaps, good policy when someone accidentally steps on someone\u2019s foot. But in the case of sexual harassment it is asking the harassed to be re-traumatized, not to mention it\u2019s essentially slapping a band-aid on the plague and calling it cured. And speaking of putting a band-aid on the plague, a female author tells this story: Another author cornered me at a book festival where he was a mainstay, year after year. He started by interrupting me whenever I tried to speak to tell me I was pretty and then escalated. He told me that it wasn\u2019t \u2018safe\u2019 to be so pretty and kept repeating that theme. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe to be that pretty. You can\u2019t just walk around here looking like that. It\u2019s not safe.\u201d Then he escalated again and told me that he\u2019d asked the \u2018Author Make a Wish Foundation\u2019 for a night alone in bed with me, and they\u2019d granted his request. Through all of this, I was frozen. Being told I wasn\u2019t safe made me feel unsafe. Other male authors witnessed it and laughed awkwardly along. When I finally made my escape, I was shaking. The harasser thanked me for being \u2018a good sport.\u2019 Other authors had seen this behavior and been warned about it. The festival organizers developed a new policy to discourage harassment and provide an avenue for reporting future incidents. They spoke to the perpetrator, but still invited him back the next year. Let me repeat that: They spoke to the perpetrator, but still invited him back the next year. First off, as we have seen in the stories of the last few months, sexual harassers and abusers tend to be repeat offenders. The responses were filled with stories of people who were harassed by someone and then discovered that this person has done the same thing to many other people. Writes an author, \u201cAt a dinner for the authors appearing at a conference, a male author followed me upstairs when I went to leave my coat in the bedroom with the rest of the coats. He trapped me between the bed and the window, standing in my way and blocking my exit. He hit on me, said that he was a big fan. And isn\u2019t it great that we can do whatever we want when our spouses are at home. He didn\u2019t say anything overtly sexual. He was just suggestive and physically imposing. When a friend came looking for me, he was like, hey, you could join us. Again, he didn\u2019t explicitly say anything sexual. It was all suggestive\u2026..We didn\u2019t report the incident. He was the big draw and we didn\u2019t think that anything would happen if we did. \u201cAfter telling other authors about the man who trapped me, it turns out that I\u2019m not the first one he\u2019s done this kind of thing to. Surprise, surprise. He\u2019s a huge missing stair in YA.\u201d A slap on the wrist isn\u2019t going to do anything. And if we invite a known harasser back to a conference or festival or send them out on tour again, we are creating a space for more people to be harassed and abused. \u201cDon\u2019t protect these men, though it may cost a publishing house money,\u201d says the author who reported that she was groped while a photo was being taken. \u201cAfter mentioning the incident to a close friend, I learned that this male author has done this exact thing many times.\u201d \u201cStop holding men on such a pedestal in this industry,\u201d echoes another. \u201cAlso, too many secrets with people \u2018in the know\u2019 being aware and the rest of the people not knowing about the history of who is safe to be around and who is not.\u201d Organizations that run conferences need, \u201ca policy about harassment, a protocol that members know about, and need to stop inviting these people to events. If people are being warned to stay away from certain speakers at events, why are these speakers still being invited?\u201d Secondly, what does it say to those who have been harassed when their harasser is back the next year? What are they supposed to do? We are putting the onus on them to either \u201cget over it\u201d or opt out. Again and again in this survey, I found women who left jobs, avoided conferences, avoided networking opportunities, stopped writing, stopped illustrating, either because they couldn\u2019t bear seeing their harasser again, or because they were afraid something like that could happen again. Sexual harassment of all types has long-term psychological consequences, including PTSD. Yet the harassers are welcomed back, then the harassed shut out. How many careers have been derailed while we looked the other way? So, What Do We Do? For harassment within companies, one former agency assistant writes, \u201cFor editors and assistant editors: UNIONIZE. More robust HR processes for naming and removing abusers. More structural support for victims.\u201d Adds a publicist, \u201cTell men that it isn\u2019t okay to use their publishing houses as a dating pool. I\u2019m here to work.\u201d But what about the other spaces? The places employment law doesn\u2019t cover? As many respondents said, conferences ought to strengthen their harassment policies and reporting procedures. Those who have been harassed need to know their rights and what to do. As one woman wrote, \u201cMaybe event organizers need to make it clear that they have a zero tolerance policy on harassment and assault? And maybe authors all need to be aware of their rights or even just what to do in the face of harassment and assault. I was so embarrassed that I didn\u2019t just yell at him or push him off, but it was like my brain froze. All I could think of was getting away and not making him mad.\u201d I checked on the website of various conference organizations, and while every organization I looked at had an anti-harassment policy they tended to be quite thin, with reporting procedures that might feel unsafe for attendees, and it seems many attendees don\u2019t know they even exist. For an example of a thorough policy and procedure, see that of WisCon. Organizations looking to develop more effective anti-harassment policies might start with the resources at Geek Feminism. As for those other spaces: \u201cI think there needs to be a clear form of legal protection for employees not under the umbrella of the big houses (& whether separate or together, clear protection for those employees under the umbrella as well). We need organizations like AAR, ABA (or new organizations) to function as modern-day unions and enforce HR policies and standards in places where combatting harassment is left in the hands of the individual employer. Think of functioning organizations like the Bar Association or even one of the Hollywood guilds\u200a\u2014\u200awhile not perfect, there are clear procedures and standards there for discrediting and disbarring those who are sexual predators, etc.\u201d But that\u2019s not all. We need to upend the way we think about sexual harassment. \u201cI believe in reform,\u201d writes the illustrator who reports being asked if she was kinky by a conference faculty member, \u201cand I believe that, when called out, people can change. But we have to find a way to allow for that reform to take place in a manner that does not infringe on the safety of others. Private reprimands and private conversations prioritize the rights of those who harass over the rights of those who are harassed.\u201d We have a hard time as a society centering those who have been harassed and assaulted, as we see in the conversation surrounding #metoo. (Unless, of course, it\u2019s criticizing the harassed for their actions and reactions.) In her essay \u201cDue Process is Needed for Sexual Harassment Accusations, But For Whom,\u201d Ijeoma Oluo writes: But now, with only a small handful of high-profile men finally facing some repercussions after years of abuse, there is already an effort to slow down. Is this becoming a witch hunt? Is this becoming a sex panic? Are innocent men at risk of being wrongly accused?\u00a0\u2026The men who are now \u201cscared to even talk to women\u201d lest they be accused of sexual harassment. And the women\u2026the women are forgotten completely. \u2026How often are we manipulated into prioritizing the abuser over the abused? In an opinion at The Daily Beast, journalist Madhulika Sikka writes: Stop lamenting the \u201closs of talent\u201d of the men who have been removed. If we examine the lost opportunities of so many women as a result of the structural obstacles to their growth, advancement, and power, that work could fill up all our time. Now is the moment to focus on the colossal damage inflicted upon talented women whose paths have been derailed, whose careers took a turn because of the toxic masculinity prevalent in so many of our media entities. It\u2019s a time to mourn for those women who were denied opportunities in one of the most influential industries in our culture. Those women with smart, creative and different ideas that would have enhanced and enriched our national conversations. The industry and the audience is poorer for it. In our industry, this seems particularly difficult. As an editor writes, \u201cWe need more frank conversations about why we, an industry dominated by straight white women, value the voices/opinions/words of men more than those of other females (especially women of color, and the voices of non-binary, disabled, and other marginalized writers). We need more conversation and exposure across the board about our culture of toxic masculinity and misogyny. Naming the problem is an early step in stopping it.\u201d Again: sexual harassment is a form of workplace discrimination. In our industry the \u201cworkplace\u201d takes many forms\u200a\u2014\u200acertainly in the offices of the publishers and agencies themselves, but also at conferences, and also in the spaces where spheres intersect. In order to do our jobs and pursue our professional goals\u200a\u2014\u200awhether it is as an agent, librarian, writer, publicist, editor\u200a\u2014\u200awe need the same access to these workspaces that men have. And that is going to require a lot of work, and some fundamental restructuring of the way we operate. We, as an industry, need to change our thinking about harassment. We need to stop centering the people who harass and abuse others. Oluo writes that she hopes \u201cthat we can all work together to be more aware of how we are being manipulated and distracted and misrepresented and shamed into believing that we do not deserve to be centered in conversations on our oppression.\u201d In another New York Magazine essay, Rebecca Traister notes that our conversation about sexual assault and harassment is framed by the very people who gain from that diminishing and gaslighting. We need to put the harassed first. This involves having clear policies and codes of conduct for conferences. It involves better HR practices for companies. It involves easy and safe mechanisms for reporting. It involves protections from and consequences for harassment in publishing contracts. And it involves keeping spaces welcoming for people who have been harassed and safe for all marginalized people. And it involves transparency. An illustrator writes: I think that we need to become more open about harassment\u200a\u2014\u200aif people have been suspended, if people have been asked to take classes in sexual harassment, whatever\u200a\u2014\u200awe need to be open about it. Look: this is a health and safety issue. If a company fires a manager because he told an employee to forget about the hardhat and then that employee got hurt, everyone would know about it. Sexual harassment is no different. And if we know that such-and-such editor or author or whomever was suspended for a period of time\u200a\u2014\u200aor banned, even\u200a\u2014\u200afor sexual harassment, then people who have been harassed will feel safer about coming forward. It is very hard to believe that you will be heard and that your harasser will face consequences when those consequences are hushed up and kept secret. Consequences need to be visible. Otherwise, the industry gives the appearance of enabling and empowering harassers. Another writer agrees, \u201cHarassment policies by organizations need to be explicitly stated and the consequences of such actions must be made clear too. It would also be nice if organizations made public statements whenever an incident does occur and action is taken. They don\u2019t even have to name names but this would at least show people that this type of behavior does happen and will not be tolerated. Right now it feels like everything is so secretive and I feel like this only protects future predators.\u201d As for the harassers themselves, publishers, agencies, and conferences ought to take responsibility for keeping our larger workspace safe. One author recommends, \u201cZero tolerance with an immediate stop by publishers or refusal by publishers to cease publishing the offenders\u2019 work or by including sexual harassment prohibition as an immediate contract termination clause.\u201d An editor echoes. \u201cZero tolerance. There needs to be a top-down prioritization of people\u2019s safety and basic humanity over the prioritization of profit.\u201d It means zero tolerance, yes. And it also means taking the time to understand why it is unsafe for people to report now. \u201cI have female coworkers who tend to downplay things,\u201d wrote a publicist. \u201c\u2018He didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u2019 or \u2018He\u2019s never done that to me.\u2019 Generally, employees, male and female, could use sexual harassment training and an understanding that women need to be believed not dismissed when reporting. Just because it didn\u2019t happen to YOU doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d That goes for the industry as a whole, too. If we put people\u2019s safety and basic humanity first, then we can do that work. We can move past a culture that teaches us to diminish sexual harassment and gaslight and further isolate the harassed. What would it look like if we, in children\u2019s publishing, decided we had zero tolerance for sexual harassment? What would it look like if we looked at all of our institutions and spheres and made combatting sexual harassment a priority in them? If we put caring for the harassed before anything else, these two ideas will naturally follow. If we put caring for the harassed first, we will make more spaces to hear their stories, we will take time to listen and understand, and we will look harder at intersectionality and at what in our culture has kept LGBTQIAP voices largely silent in this conversation. If we put the harassed first, when someone wrings their hands about the effects on harassers\u2019 careers, or derails with the specter of slippery slopes, or talks about how nice the harasser has been to them, or turns the conversation to when we can allow harassers back into our spheres, we will say: No. We\u2019re not going to center the harassers now. Our time and energy needs to be spent taking care of the people who have been harassed, and doing everything we can to make sure there aren\u2019t more. It\u2019s not a solution. But it\u2019s a start.

Why is Goal Setting so important? In life, you are either part of somebody else\u2019s plan, or you are part of your plan. People who don\u2019t set goals, tend to \u201cgo with the wind\u201d, and believe that life happens to them, or that whatever they have or don\u2019t have is due to a matter of \u201cluck\u201d. Imagine, two sailboats on the Ocean. One says \u201cI want to go to the Bahamas\u201d and it sets sails to the Bahamas, and it gets there. The other one, never even thought about the fact that it is important to have direction, goes to the ocean, enjoys each day at a time and just \u201cgoes with the flow\u201d. A few weeks later, it landed in Afghanistan. That is difference between setting goals and not setting goals. It\u2019s the difference between taking charge and control of your life, vs having life, taking control of you. Taking charge, does not mean, not enjoying the journey, or not going with the flow. It simply means, you enjoy the journey, but you know where you are headed, and you work towards it, on a daily basis, until you reach your desired destination. A research study done by Harvard University, took two distinct groups of people. The low achievement group, when asked to set goals and perform the same task, achieved significantly higher performance and success rates, coupled with higher levels of motivation, drive and happiness. Hundreds of experimental studies have been done, and they have all proved the same conclusion: that Goal Setting increases significantly the Success rate, in any area of life in which it is a applied\u200a\u2014\u200athis means\u200a\u2014\u200abusiness, family, mental, physical, financial, spiritual, social etc. You will want to set goals for all areas of your life, otherwise, you may succeed in one, whilst all the other ones are out of balance. With that being said, \u201calthough Goal Setting improves performance robustly, across various settings, it is nevertheless, a skill. One must learn how to effectively set goals\u201d (S Turkay: 2014) Throughout my life, I have always been a goal setter, tested many different systems and techniques, and achieved many of the goals that were closest to my heart. I have also learned, one specific thing, that was not taught anywhere else\u200a\u2014\u200aand that is, your goals, must be aligned with your Purpose. When your goals are disconnected from your Purpose, you can set on a Life Journey to achieve many things to prove your external worth to the public, but not really be fulfilled from inside out. You will reach those goals, and still feel like there is something missing\u200a\u2014\u200aand that is because the goals you set for yourself were not aligned with your Life Purpose. In this article, I share with you 5 Proven Ways that you can Set and Achieve your Goals. Do you find yourself setting beautiful and amazing goals, but somehow losing motivation to do them? You force yourself to push through, and from the outside this is the \u201cright thing\u201d to be achieving, but something in your heart doesn\u2019t feel like doing it. You are not motivated from within, and so you look for external motivators to keep you going. If this sounds like you, more than likely, the problem is not motivation, but instead, lack of alignment. There are two ways to set goals. The superficial and traditional way is setting goals based on what you think you should be doing or accomplishing. These goals work and are achievable BUT, these are also the goals you are likely to drop along the way, because they are not aligned with your Purpose or/and Higher Self. You may not drop them, but you may get there and be like \u201coh is this it?\u201d. The feeling you were after and experience you were after, were not delivered by this goal\u200a\u2014\u200abecause, this goal was never in alignment in the first place. So, when you set your goals, go for your deepest dreams, desires, passions and Calling. Don\u2019t let the voice inside your head tell you \u201cit\u2019s impossible\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s too complicated\u201d, etc\u200a\u2014\u200abecause if you don\u2019t set that goal, you will never do, what you were put on earth to do. Thus, my #1 tip is\u200a\u2014\u200aSet Goals, aligned with your Soul & Purpose. You may know what you want and where you are going. But it is extremely important to have a written plan for what you have set yourself to achieve, and how you plan to get to get there. It is even more important, to look at that plan often, because during your journey, I guarantee you, you will have many distractions and many shiny opportunities, that will take you off-course\u200a\u2014\u200aif you don\u2019t remember your destination. Goals that are set and put away in some drawer to collect dust and forgotten are often never achieved. You need to stay connected with your goals, and review them often, so keep them somewhere where you can see them, rather than setting goals in a book and storing it. Review your Goals each week and track your progress. See where you are falling behind, and why. Adjust your goal achieving tactics, based on your performance. Look at your goals every day, if not every week. Stay focused. When you set goals, you want to make sure you achieve them. Goals are not dreams. After you have dreamed, you sit down, and you write down your goals. Goals are meant to be achieved. And especially when they are connected with your Life Purpose, then they take on a new form, they become something that you must achieve, rather than something you could achieve, someday. What is one effective way to make sure you follow through on your goals? Having an Accountability System or Partner. If you set goals and don\u2019t share them with anyone, it\u2019s no big deal if you don\u2019t achieve them as you would be the only person who knew about your secret goal, and if you are okay with letting yourself down, there is no accountability for not achieving that goal. An accountability system ties your goal to a person, community or public who will hold you accountable. For example, when I first decided to have a blog, it was a an idea, in my imagination, connected to a bigger long term goal. I then connected that to my existing goal setting system. And then, I made the public, my accountability partner. So I would write, and publish consistently, even if I didn\u2019t have enough readers. Just the fact that I had this blog live and public, pushed me to continue writing and publishing my work. If you want to lose 10KGs, you may have a weekly and daily nutrition plan, to follow through and measure your plan against your results. You may share that plan with your accountability partner at the end of each day or week, and that alone subconsciously forces you to want to follow through. Or you may train with a friend 3 times a week, or with a personal trainer.Just knowing that your friend is waiting for you at 7am outside your house, will get you to wake up on time, put on your running shoes, and get to work. That\u2019s the power of accountability. When we start any new journey, we imagine a smooth sail. We believe everything will be easy, smooth and go according to plan. I am an optimist by nature, so I confess, I often fall for this trap. Which is how I finally embraced the fact that the journey may not be a straight line, smooth and all champagne and caviar. Your goal must be worthy of your life enough (rather than you being worthy of your goal), because when you face obstacles and challenges on your path, you must find the strength, drive and motivation to keep going. And any goal worthy of achieving, takes time, commitment, persistence and hard work. If a goal is \u201cnot that important to you\u201d, you will not do what it takes to achieve it. That doesn\u2019t make you a failure, it simply means, you must find a goal that is worthy of your life. Now that you know that your journey may not be a straight line, it means that you will be met with opposition, challenges and obstacles on the way to your goal. If you are not mentally prepared for them, these are enough to 1. Take you off course 2. Stop you and make you quit So, before you start, prepare yourself mentally to meet obstacles, and to find the means and resources to overcome them. Make a list in advance of all the potential roadblocks you think you will or can encounter. Then make a contingency plan for overcoming those. Of course, there are blows that you never planned or even expected, and you will have to deal with those as they arise. Overall, the most important thing, is to be mentally prepared, to face whatever opposition or challenges may come your way, and to be committed to finding a solution and staying on course\u200a\u2014\u200ano matter how long it takes, or how tough it gets, you keep going, no matter what.

If you look hard enough, you might notice a few subtle differences: The image on the right: The image on the left is a screenshot from Sketch, and the image on the right is a reproduction on iOS. These differences arise when the graphics are rendered. They have the exact same font, line spacing, shadow radius, colors, and gradient attributes\u200a\u2014\u200aall of the constants are identical. As you can see, some aspects of the original design can be lost during the conversion from the design file to real code. We\u2019re going to explore some of these details so you can know what to watch for and how to fix them. Design is critical to a successful mobile app. Especially on iOS, users are accustomed to apps that work well and look good. If you\u2019re a mobile app designer or developer, you know how important small details are to the end user experience. High-quality software can only come from people who care deeply about their craft. There are many reasons why apps might not look as good as their original designs. We\u2019re going to investigate one of the more subtle reasons\u200a\u2014\u200adifferences in rendering between Sketch and iOS. Certain types of user interface elements have noticeable differences between Sketch and iOS. We are going to explore the following elements: Typography can be implemented in various ways, but for this test I am going to use labels (\u201cText\u201d element in Sketch, UILabel in iOS). Let\u2019s look at some of the differences: The biggest difference in the example above is the location of line breaks. The third grouping of text starting with \u201cThis text is SF Semibold\u201d breaks after the word \u201c25\u201d in the design, but after the word \u201cpoints\u201d in the app. This same problem occurs with the paragraph of text\u2014the line breaks are inconsistent. Another smaller difference is that the leading (line spacing) and tracking (character spacing) are slightly larger in Sketch. It\u2019s easier to see these differences when they are directly overlaid: What about other typefaces? Replacing San Francisco with Lato (a widely used free font), we get the following results: Much better! There are still some differences in leading and tracking, but these are generally small. Be careful though\u2014if the text needs to align with other elements like background images, these small offsets can be noticeable. Some of these issues are related to the default iOS font: San Francisco. When iOS renders the system font, it automatically includes tracking based on the point size. This automatically-applied tracking table is available on Apple\u2019s website. There is a Sketch plugin called \u201cSF Font Fixer\u201d which reflects these values in Sketch. I highly recommend it if your design uses San Francisco. (Side Note: Always remember to make the text box wrap tightly around text in Sketch. This can be done by selecting the text and toggling between \u201cFixed\u201d and \u201cAuto\u201d alignment, then resetting the width of the text box. If there is any extra spacing, this can easily lead to incorrect values being entered into the layout.) Unlike typography which has universal layout rules, shadows are less well-defined. As we can see in the image above, shadows in iOS are larger by default. In the examples above, this makes the most difference on the top edges of the rectangles. Shadows are tricky because the parameters between Sketch and iOS are not the same. The biggest difference is that there is no concept of \u201cspread\u201d on a CALayer, although this can be overcome by increasing the size of the layer that contains the shadow. Shadows can vary wildly in their difference between Sketch and iOS. I\u2019ve seen some shadows with the exact same parameters look great in Sketch but be nearly invisible when running on a real device. Shadows are tricky and require manual adjustment to match the original design. Oftentimes, the shadow radius will need to be lower and the opacity will need to be higher. The required changes vary based on size, color, and shape\u200a\u2014\u200ahere, we only need a few minor adjustments. Gradients prove to be troublesome as well. Of the three gradients, only the \u201corange\u201d (top) and \u201cblue\u201d (bottom right) differ. The orange gradient looks more horizontal in Sketch, but more vertical in iOS. As a result, the overall color of the gradient is darker in the final app than the design. The difference is more noticeable in the blue gradient\u2014the angle is more vertical in iOS. This gradient is defined by three colors: light blue in the bottom left corner, dark blue in the middle, and pink in the top right corner. The start and ending points may need to be adjusted if the gradient is angled. Try offsetting the startPoint and endPoint of your CAGradientLayer slightly to account for these differences. There\u2019s no magic formula here*\u2014the values need to be adjusted and iterated until the results visually match. *Jirka T\u0159e\u010d\u00e1k posted an excellent response with links explaining how the gradient rendering works. Check it out if you want to dive deep into more code! I built a demo app to easily see these differences on a real device. It includes the examples above, along with source code and original Sketch file so you can tweak the constants to your heart\u2019s content. This is a great way to increase awareness within your team\u2014just hand them your phone and they can see for themselves. Simply touch anywhere on the screen to toggle bewteen the images (similar to the gifs above). Get the open-source demo app here: https://github.com/nathangitter/sketch-vs-ios Don\u2019t assume that equal values imply equal results. Even if the numbers match, the visual appearance may not. At the end of the day, there needs to be iteration after any design is implemented. Good collaboration between design and engineering is crucial for a high-quality end product. Enjoyed the story?

I don\u2019t even like the word, if I\u2019m honest. And yet I find myself helplessly clicking on pretty much any link that promises to list five new ways to improve it. And the more of these articles I read, the more miserable I become because this business of productivity is not a cheerful one. Not only do the authors not seem to be terribly happy about their awesome productivity rates, but you begin to suspect that all they are actually producing is articles on improving productivity. \u201cI wake up, check emails, meditate, write a Five Minute Journal, schedule my To Dos, run seven miles to clear my head and \u201cprime\u201d the day, then I hit my desk and write three articles on productivity before breakfast (granola and local honey).\u201d All of which just puts me in mind of the least productive image imaginable: I have, nonetheless, become obsessed with productivity methods. (I think I\u2019m supposed to call them \u201chacks\u201d but I can\u2019t, sorry.) As a professional writer there\u2019s pretty much nothing better that procrastinating over pieces on how to avoid procrastination. Luckily, people have written whole books on the subject and it\u2019s possible to spend weeks reading them rather than doing any work. Over the last few years, I think I\u2019ve tried pretty much every hack (yay, I did it!) that\u2019s out there and can now report back on what actually seems to work for an average human being. Before we get to that, though, something by way of a caveat: be doing something you want to do. In broad terms this means that if you go to an office every day to sit surrounded by people you don\u2019t like, working for assholes on a pointless job that you hate, then I don\u2019t know how you increase your productivity and I really don\u2019t know why you\u2019d want to. Honestly, dick around a little; don\u2019t take it all so seriously. Even as a freelancer though, doing something you like is still not a given. I always wanted to be freelance and to make up stories for a living. I get to do that and yay etc but I still have bills to pay and so I have still had to take jobs that didn\u2019t exactly thrill me in order to do that. If I can\u2019t find a way to make that job interesting then I ensure that I\u2019m also writing something of my own alongside it (or I\u2019m way into a big video game). That way I can do five pages of the drudge job and then reward myself by moving onto something I enjoy. Recently, though, I\u2019ve been lucky to have weeded most of those kind of jobs out and I\u2019m in a position to make choices about what I work on. (There is a solid argument, by the way, to say that if you\u2019re not actually starving to death you can ALWAYS make those choices and the work that you want to do will turn out better and do more for your career than the jobs you think you SHOULD take.) So now I adopt an approach that I think may have come from Derek Sivers: It\u2019s either \u201cHell Yeah!\u201d or it\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d. That job that sounds like it might be interesting, or have some interesting element to it but you\u2019re not sure? That job your agent says you should do because these are good people to be in business with or it\u2019ll look good on the resume? Six months down the road, you will hate every minute of it; say no now. If the idea doesn\u2019t make you want to literally jump for joy and air punch every time you think of it, it\u2019s a no. It\u2019s brutal, but it makes for a happier, more productive life and better quality work. Realistically, if you can put that into practice 100%, you can stop reading now because any job that you\u2019d rather do than watch TV doesn\u2019t have any productivity issues attached to it. But we\u2019re all still here because it\u2019s an imperfect world and because sometimes even the best projects hit a sticky patch. (Right now, I have a script on my desk wherein Act Two is twice as long as any reasonable human being should expect. It\u2019s a good story, I\u2019m enjoying writing it, it was a Hell Yeah project. Nonetheless, I\u2019m writing a blog about productivity rather than getting that red pen out.) Getting up early. That\u2019s a thing I\u2019ve started doing and I\u2019ve already droned on about it HERE so I won\u2019t bore you again except to say that I\u2019ve discovered that robbing the last two hours of the evening, wherein I achieve little beyond dozing off in front of The X-Files, and tacking them onto the front of the morning where they become two uninterrupted hours where a load of work can get done before other people are even awake, is already paying dividends. Getting pages written before the school run really changes the shape and possibilities for the rest of the day. Morning pages. This comes from the Artist\u2019s Way by Julian Cameron which is the most hopelessly hippy book ever but, at the same time, is actually pretty good. The morning pages are the cornerstone of it. In a nutshell; wake up and write three pages of whatever comes into your head; pure stream-of-consciousness bullshit. Except it turns out it may not be bullshit, it may actually contain some inspirational gems and reveal things you\u2019re thinking about that you weren\u2019t consciously aware of. The idea is that it moves thoughts that are blocking your creativity out of your head and onto the paper, so you can get the mental flow going. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s doing but I\u2019ve been trying it the last few days and it does SOMETHING good so I\u2019m going to keep going with it. My one tip; Cameron doesn\u2019t mention paper size, so I started writing on an A4 pad. Don\u2019t. It\u2019s too much. It felt like homework and by the time I\u2019d scribbled three sides of A4 the last thing I wanted to do was write anything else. My friend Adeline (@Mrs_Scott_V on Twitter; she roasts the most amazing coffee, buy some) recommended 3 pages of the Midori Traveler\u2019s Notebook and this is much more doable. It\u2019s also an excuse to buy a Midori Traveler\u2019s notebook, and that\u2019s no bad thing. You\u2019re welcome. To Do lists. I\u2019m addicted. I use Things 3 (I was using OmniFocus but it\u2019s too labour intensive\u200a\u2014\u200ayou end up having \u201cupdate OmniFocus\u201d on your To Do list, which seems self-defeating) and I use a physical bullet journal. Bullet journling is awesome but I\u2019m not going to explain it because Google exists. Try it if you haven\u2019t already. Leuchtturm make a really great bullet journal that you can buy in Rymans and it has instructions in the back of it. Get that.\u00a0I also use a Kanban board on Trello for an overview of what I\u2019m working on that doesn\u2019t change day to day. Again, Google \u201ckanban method\u201d, I\u2019m not going to do all the heavy lifting here\u2026 OK, fine, basically you have three columns; To Do, Doing and Done. And all you focus on are the \u201cDoing\u201d items and there should be a hard limit on those (I have 5). You can\u2019t add anything to the Doing column until you\u2019ve moved something to Done. But still Google it because there\u2019s a little more to it than that. It\u2019s a Japanese system, which means it works. What Kanban has shown me though, and it\u2019s also been mentioned in a couple of productivity articles I\u2019ve read, is that you don\u2019t want more than five things on your To Do list. I mean, outside of \u201cbuy milk\u201d or whatever. Five things that you can actually get done. Do them, tick them off, move on. More than five and you just have tasks hanging over into the following day because you had to make some calls or you got a flat tire or whatever, and that\u2019s demoralising. Five things max. Pomodoros. That\u2019s the 25 minute work windows that I talked about on an INFODUMP newsletter a few weeks ago. Again, Google is your friend. A lot of people got in touch to say they\u2019d tried it out and it\u2019s a life saver. I use them all day, with the exception of those first two hours in the morning that don\u2019t seem to require them. I use an app called Focus which is great for timing Pomodoros and then nagging you to take a five minute break. TAKE THE BREAK. I know you\u2019re in the middle of stuff and you don\u2019t want to but TAKE THE BREAK or you bust the system; trust me on this. So now I need a fifth thing to deliver on the promise of the title\u2026 What is it? Oh\u2026 ANALOGUE DAY! Analogue Day. This is a new thing we\u2019re doing at home and I want to take credit for inventing it but I probably didn\u2019t. Or maybe I did! Quote me in your correspondence and we\u2019ll make it The Simpson Method. Anyway, it\u2019s exactly what it sounds like; turn off the computer and the iPad and put the phone in another room as far as that is possible. One day a week where you write longhand, read actual physical books and magazines, talk to people and all that touchy feely stuff. When you make things up for a living, you are constantly drawing on a well of ideas and inspiration and that well is finite. You need to refill it regularly. And you don\u2019t do that online. Or if you do, you can do it the other six days of the week. Analogue Day is about changing pace and changing input, grabbing a book off the shelf rather than scrolling Facebook, listening to stuff, watching stuff (I don\u2019t ban myself from movies and TV on analogue day, but there\u2019s no dicking around online whilst half-watching something). One day a week and it REALLY pays dividends creatively. Personally, I have a bunch of magazine subscriptions that build into a pile on the table throughout the week so I take this day to go through them. Then I might scan the bookshelves for something I\u2019d forgotten I had and start reading it. It\u2019s all about new things and unexpected creative prompts and I\u2019ve found it to be enormously helpful and also, which seems to be anathema to the productivity nerds, fun. And that\u2019s it, I\u2019ve done it. I\u2019ve written a \u201cFive things\u2026\u201d article. But now I should post and shut up because it\u2019s meant to be Analogue Day today. Nobody\u2019s perfect. This piece also appears on the INFODUMP blog By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out. Writer/Director working in TV, film and radio.

Who wants to see that?\u201d A current jolts through my body. I am electric with fear, singed by exhaustion. I remember the fact of my body, so much larger than hers. \u201cShe does,\u201d I say. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s her body. You don\u2019t have to look if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d \u201cLook,\u201d you sigh. \u201cI know you\u2019re all about body positivity. I am, too, as long as you\u2019re not obese.\u201d My arms tense, calves flexed. I am calculating how long I can stay here, with you. By the standards of the Body Mass Index, I\u2019m not obese. I\u2019m what it alternately calls extremely obese or super morbidly obese. According to the simple arithmetic of the BMI\u200a\u2014\u200aa statistical tool created two centuries ago to measure populations, not individuals\u200a\u2014\u200amy particular body is still unimaginably, unforgivably fat. I am cartoon villain fat. My body is an epidemic. My body provoked an unending war on obesity. Even 75 pounds smaller, I have descended from unthinkably fat to a garden variety sudden death fat. But I do not describe myself as obese. Instead, I say simply that I am fat. It is short, straightforward, descriptive, easily understood. Fat does not claim anything my body is not, does not assign value unless I bestow it. Fat comes from people who are comfortable enough with my body to treat it as a matter of fact. Fat does not ooze with benevolent disdain, does not crawl with judgment. Obese is deceptively medical, regularly used by people whose concerns are anything but, and who are almost never doctors. Obese drips from the lips of those who consider their disdain a blessing, a noble gift from a magnanimous benefactor that will end this wretched chapter in this unfortunate body. Obese almost always preludes diet advice, dating tips, or other demonstrations of thinner people\u2019s believed mastery of a life I cannot possibly lead. Obese accompanies an insistence on the superiority of thin bodies, and the character, will, intelligence and tenacity that earned them thinness like a medal. Obese often comes with a quiet cruelty, a creeping condescention. I didn\u2019t expect it from you. There\u2019s a power dynamic that comes with people who call my body obese. It hides otherwise naked disdain behind a gossamer thin veil of medicine, legitimating the bullying and lecturing that will inevitably follow. And that disdain is often borne of a deep, uncontested belief that thin people are superior to fat people in nearly every way. After all, they must be smart enough to understand thermodynamics and dietetics; moral enough to understand their obligation to remain thin; have the strength of will and character to stick to a plan; exhibit the determination to work out every day. Even if they have always been thin. Even if they don\u2019t do any of those things. But fat is so much simpler. It is a prosaic insult that reveals its speaker so readily. It is also a plain descriptor that simply, accurately describes my skin. Not like the slippery saccharine venom of obese. I\u2019ve heard I\u2019m body positive but\u2026 more times than I can count. Caveats abound. Yes, you should feel good about your body, but only if you\u2019re not too fat. Only if you\u2019re healthy. Only if you\u2019re able-bodied. Only if you remember your place. Only if you stay forever vigilant, always remembering that your body is less than. Only if you stay ashamed. I\u2019m body positive as long as you\u2019re not, you know, obese. For fat people, daring to feel even neutrally about our embattled bodies is a mortal sin. But if body positivity isn\u2019t for fat people, who is it for? If body positivity only extends to people who already meet our standards of beauty and virtue, what does it accomplish? I\u2019m body positive as long as you\u2019re healthy. But what of those with chronic illnesses, reaching to love the bodies that cannot love them back? Are cancer patients the kind of healthy that will be permitted to embrace their own skin? What about type two diabetics, people with hypertension, people with gout? What if you\u2019re sick, and the whole world tells you it\u2019s your fault? What if you\u2019re not sick, and the whole rest of the world insists you are? Would you permit those people to love themselves? Underneath all those caveats lies an insidious implication that body positivity is reserved for the pure, the pious, and the strong of heart. The belief that body positivity only belongs to those of us who remember the inherent repulsiveness of our bodies, who have done penance for our size six silhouettes too long. Body positivity is only for people who are wrong about the disgustingness of our bodies. Body positive caveats tell us that there is a kind of body that deserves to feel good about our bodies. The rest of us, though, ought to stay on our toes. And caveats on body positivity reveal an underlying belief that we somehow chose our bodies. Body positivity that\u2019s contingent on health, size or activity levels implies that, if each of us worked hard enough and dedicated ourselves fully enough, we could become as thin as we wanted. As if we consciously selected our bodies. As if fat people, people with disabilities, people who cannot claim health or thinness are somehow to blame for the burden of our bodies. Thin people have somehow outwitted their bodies, while I have succumbed to mine. If only I\u2019d been shrewder, more dedicated, longer suffering, smarter or stronger, I could have earned a thin body. And then\u200a\u2014\u200aonly then\u200a\u2014\u200aI, too, could have body positivity. My muscles stay tense around you now. I find myself ready to fight, ready to leave at any moment. I silence my telephone when you call, find reasons not to call back. Because even if you do not believe any of this, you have revealed it to me. To you, bodies like mine have not earned peace with our own skin. To you, people like me, people like that stranger in a crop top, do not merit a simple ease with the bodies we have always had. And because of that, I struggle to feel that simple ease with you. I am not obese, not an epidemic, not an enemy combatant in a war on obesity. I am not struggling to claim unjustly a body positivity that I have not earned. I am only trying to negotiate a ceasefire with my own skin. I am only trying to embrace each of us as we are. I am only trying to find my way to some semblance of wholeness. I do not attach caveats to my love of you. I do not wish your body away, or quietly sequester it from the world of realer, more deserving people. I do not begrudge you your struggles with your own size or skin. I do not deny you the hard-fought wins you have found in your battle to embrace your body. I wish you would not deny mine.

In this article, I am going to tell you why. It is not an absolute. There are never any absolutes. And for what its worth, musicians run a close second, but that will have to be another series entirely. In this series, it is the gamers turn\u2026 and there it is. Turn-Based Strategy games (TBS) have been around a damn long time. Chess is a prime example, but don\u2019t forget Go or Checkers (Draughts for those readers across the pond). I am not going to repeat the history, but feel free to read more here: So why are turn-based games so important? They focus you on iteration. They are iterative models. Analysts who are good at and enjoy thinking iteratively are quite often more successful than those who are not and cannot. It is an important skill set. It is one of those things that makes someone an analyst by nature. But that doesn\u2019t mean that a lot of practice won\u2019t help. TBS games range vastly in complexity. This has been true from the beginning of computer gaming. Games like Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization have been around for nearly three decades. Yet Civ is in no way a simple simulation. White TBS games may be easier to code than their real-time (RTS) counter parts, they require an intricacy and elegance to create great game play. Many of these games were early on the scene in PC gaming. Turn-based games have less dependency on CPU than RTS games. They also require less in terms of graphics. The keyword being require. Plenty of games released recently have stunning graphics. They just don\u2019t need them. As a result, TBS games are also quite popular in the mobile gaming space where constraints are similar. I am also not saying that TBS games are not CPU or memory intensive. Anyone who has tried to play Civ IV or higher on an older computer knows what a hog some of these games can be. Typically though, this is a function of the graphics and/or the artificial intelligence. The AI is another critical component of our story. We can only go so far in this article, but let\u2019s break it down. That is, after all, one half of the analytic process. Analysis is breaking things down into individual elements, steps, and components. All of these concepts are present in most games, but TBS provide the player a better opportunity to recognize them. But most games offer an opportunity for analysis, TBS do an even better job of allowing an opportunity for Synthesis, the other half of the process. Synthesis is putting things together. Although you may do just that during an RTS or other game, TBS put nearly all their focus on this activity. Great TBS gamers are constantly synthesizing, mapping what series of steps will lead with the highest probability to the most desired outcome. It is a fertile and fun practice ground. One of its most important lessons likely seems minor\u2026 patience. I am not talking about patient gamers. That is a concept designed to make gaming affordable and more consistent. It is a good one, but it is too indirect. Gamers learn to be patient with game progression, even when we don\u2019t like it. That is notable on the analytics floor. One of the biggest issues for young analysts is their rush to skip steps attempting to jump to the end. We all want to, but those of us who are gamers know that doesn\u2019t end well. Non-gamers eventually learn it, too. They are just slower, having had far less \u201ctraining\u201d. Do you doubt that? Have you ever seen the tech tree in Civilization? I used it as an image divider above. Gamers learn patience. They also wreck themselves on endless gaming binges and all-nighters, but they know better than to try and skip steps. Or more precisely, to try to skip steps simply from a sense of impatience. We will do another article some time on gamers and efficiency. Also, did you catch that? I called gaming\u200a\u2014\u200atraining. I am not taking it back, either. It truly can be. So can jumping rope, but any fighter who steps in a boxing ring after a marathon jump roping session but no other training is going to get their brains beaten out of them. They might display some fancy footwork in the process, but\u2026 well, you get the idea. So train on! Game on! And thanks for reading!

In homage I had wanted to begin this column, \u201cNews of the Word,\u201d with the phrase; but in intervening decades, the expression \u201cHow do you do\u201d has fallen out of favor, replaced by the more perfunctory \u201cNice to meet you,\u201d or the slangy \u201cHow ya doin\u2019?\u201d or \u201cHow\u2019s it goin\u2019?\u201d If you are determined to hear someone say \u201cHow do you do,\u201d your best bet is to watch the film My Fair Lady\u200a\u2014\u200ain which Audrey Hepburn (as Eliza Doolittle) says it repeatedly, with a mannered flourish. These days, though, there is no longer one de rigueur stock phrase of introduction. And so, I\u2019ll just begin, \u201cHi, folks.\u201d Question: What do I mean by \u201cfolks\u201d? The word \u201cfolks\u201d used to have a bonhomous, backslapping, affectionate quality in this country; \u201cfolks\u201d were ordinary people like you and me, whom we recognized as familiar, or even familial. One entry in my deskside American Heritage Dictionary defines \u201cfolks\u201d as: \u201cThe members of one\u2019s family or childhood household; relatives\u201d; another explains that, once the word \u201cfolks\u201d moves beyond that narrow circle, it tends to latch on to a descriptive phrase\u200a\u2014\u200arich folks, poor folks, black folks, white folks, \u201cold folks, just plain folks, country folks\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ato specify the particular type of folksiness implied. Lately, though, the usage of this word has been shifting, and the change has come from the White House\u200a\u2014\u200atransforming the \u201cfolks\u201d of yesteryear into a complex and alien entourage whom you\u2019d be unhappy to bump into at a backyard barbecue. In September, when President Obama sat with the reporter Steve Kroft of 60 Minutes to discuss the terrorist groups ISIS (which he calls ISIL)and Khorasan, he warned that \u201cthose folks could kill Americans\u201d and urged \u201cArab and Muslim leaders to say very clearly, \u2018These folks do not represent us.\u2019\u201d Another group of folks, the Syrian rebel fighters whom the United States had decided not to arm, early in that country\u2019s civil war, seemed to elicit more fellow feeling, though President Obama refuted the \u201cmythology\u201d that \u201cif we had given those folks some guns two and a half years ago, that Syria would be fine.\u201d Back in August, the President had regretted the excesses of the CIA toward yet another group in the aftermath of 9/11, when he said, \u201cWe tortured some folks\u201d; while, several years before, he had denounced domestic fearmongers who demonized his healthcare plan, because \u201csome of the same folks who are spreading these tall tales have fought against Medicare in the past.\u201d The \u201cfolks\u201d President Obama speaks of often have a negative or alien aura, a quality of \u201cthem,\u201d not \u201cus.\u201d They are terrorists or armed militants, hard-hearted ideologues or benighted unfortunates. This is new. When President Clinton used the word \u201cfolks\u201d in the \u201990s, during State of the Union addresses, stump speeches, and NAFTA talks, he did so in the time-honored, colloquial manner, making \u201cfolks\u201d synonymous with \u201cpeople\u201d but more personal; and that\u2019s still how he uses the word 20 years on: to show his commonality with and sympathy for his audience. In \u201cA Place Called Hope,\u201d the speech in which he accepted the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 1992, he suggested that all Americans were just folks: \u201cThere is no them; there is only us.\u201d So, when I say, \u201cHi, folks,\u201d I revert to the traditional, inclusive spirit of the word; \u201cus,\u201d not \u201cthem.\u201d From this group, however, I would like to exclude gentlemen, who lately have taken on a markedly ungentlemanly character. When a disturbed Iraq war veteran named Omar Gonzalez scaled the White House fence last month and sprinted deep into the executive mansion, some journalists conferred the title of gentleman upon him. \u201cThere\u2019s the gentleman, you see him running across the White House lawn,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz-Balart on MSNBC, as he relayed news of the home invasion. Gonzalez was \u201cthe same gentleman who, twice in months prior, posed a direct threat to the White House,\u201d wrote the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, explaining that, in July, \u201cafter a high-speed chase, he was found with 11 guns and a map,\u201d while in August, he had appeared in front of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue with a hatchet. The September intruder should not be confused with the Ferguson Missouri policeman Darren Wilson, whose boss, Police Chief Tom Jackson, described him as \u201cnice, respectable, and well-mannered, a gentleman\u201d after he shot and killed an unarmed man named Michael Brown. Commentators often bemoan the decline of civility in public discourse, but the excessive rise of misplaced civility is just as good a source for consternation. Historically, Americans have preferred to be called gentlemen, rather than simply folks, whenever possible. When Frances Trollope, mother of the British novelist Anthony Trollope, moved from England to Tennessee and Ohio in 1827, this preference was already well-established. In her scathing, humorous accounts of this country\u2019s rough-and-ready language and customs, Domestic Manners of the Americans, which she published upon her return to England for the entertainment of her countrymen, she wrote with patronizing amusement that she found \u201cdraymen, butcher\u2019s boys and the labourers on the canal\u201d all were called \u201cgentlemen\u201d in these parts. Her own definition hewed closer to the definition that you\u2019ll still find in the American Heritage Dictionary today: \u201cA man of gentle or noble birth or superior social position.\u201d We Americans have little patience for such snobbish exclusiveness. To our ears, her criticisms have an unladylike ring (though Mark Twain applauded her bile, and said, \u201cShe was merely telling the truth and this indignant nation knew it\u201d). So\u200a\u2014\u200ashould you call a menacing stranger with a hatchet, gun, or automatic weapon in his hands a gentleman? Sometimes yes, sometimes no; you can\u2019t always be sure, but most folks will know the difference when they see it.

You\u2019ve put your hopes and dreams into a product, and are left with nothing to show for it. You launch, and sit there waiting to see results. But imagine, nothing happens. It happens to most founders, myself included once. So you start questioning yourself. Did I mess up the product? Did I target the wrong people? You feel lost because you don\u2019t know where things went wrong, why they went wrong, or how to fix them. So what if there was a way to give you clear directions to: The thing that\u2019s amazed me after interviewing 100s of entrepreneurs, is the difference between experienced and inexperienced ones. The experienced ones all seem to have mastered the one growth hack to rule them all. They use a growth hack that is the essence of building a company. It\u2019s what separates startup ideas from startup companies. This one is the toughest, but it will beat all the other strategies. Want to know what it is? Five words that encapsulate the whole purpose of your startup. While most entrepreneurs think they\u2019re building something that people will love, they actually don\u2019t. As much as 42% of startups fail because they built something without a market for it. But how do you do this? To start, let me quickly sum up the major reasons why entrepreneurs worldwide fail moving forward: The level of success of your startup is more in your control than you think. But you can\u2019t wish for it to happen. You must put in the work to keep these reasons from affecting your business. Here\u2019s how: So what should be the first step when you\u2019re starting your startup? Figuring out whether you\u2019ve got a good product in a good market. This is because when starting out, everything is an assumption. Who your customer is, what problem they need you to solve for them, whether your solution is the right one, how you\u2019re going to market it to them\u2026 All assumptions, and assumptions are risks. So how do you deal with this risk with the least amount of money needed? You start talking to your potential customers! You start validating. You need to adopt a data-seeking mindset. You\u2019re looking for input on what you\u2019re going to build before you\u2019re going to build it. And this data is not anywhere in your office. There are no facts inside the building. You have to talk to your customers to move forward. You need to fall in love with the process of spending time with your potential customers. Ask about pains. Listen. Validate your idea. Customer feedback is your magic potion to becoming the best you can be. Don\u2019t make the mistake of not drinking it. You\u2019ll be amazed at how much people are willing to open themselves up and connect with you. Take away: the real success in your early days isn\u2019t the amount of cash you raise, it\u2019s you proving there\u2019s a market demand for your product using the only research method that counts: the market itself. Want to document how to do it? Use this tool, and connect with me on LinkedIn if you want some personal help. I once followed a course on storytelling by Pixar. In it, they describe how they try to develop the characters for their stories. They basically come up with two parts: That\u2019s business for you right there, summed up in two elements. Many entrepreneurs fail to realise this. For many people, it\u2019s taking a technology and turning it into a business with the underlying dream of selling it to Microsoft, Google, Facebook or any large company. If that\u2019s your strategy, you\u2019re setting yourself up for failure. Steve Blank has framed it in a more professional way. He worked on and with multiple successful companies. According to him, the one thing that separates successful businesses from unsuccessful ones is their focus on understanding the customer. You stop making it about product development, but focus on customer development. This means you: Once you start focusing on real-world problems and start helping others become better, everything gets a lot easier. People are willing to pay if you help them achieve success. Attracting the top minds will be far easier it you follow a noble cause. Take away: stop building a business with the idea of selling to a huge business, and start making it about other people. Who are you doing this for, and what will you have changed FOR THEM in the coming five years if you\u2019re successful? Paul Graham described it best: A mistake I\u2019ve seen many founders make, is to focus on optimisation vs learning. We only think about the point of having million users. While many success stories might look like this, they didn\u2019t start like this. Airbnb founders went door to door to take pictures. Stripe founders took people\u2019s computer to install their software. All successful startups once had a number of users they could count on two hands. Through repeatedly doing things that didn\u2019t scale, they nailed the perfect product. When you\u2019re starting out, you want to learn as much as you can from your customers. It will tell you: But how? Take-away: In your early days, focus on learning instead of optimising. Nothing can replace the power of being genuine and developing a trusted partnership with your first customer. So, focus on nurturing relationships with potential early adopters. They\u2019re crucial to your success, and keen on your success. New product\u2019s success or failure is always a gamble, and strategy isn\u2019t about perfection. It\u2019s about increasing the odds of winning. Until we figure out how to guarantee success, speaking to other your customers looks like an effective way to stack the deck with minimum losses and maximise possible gains.

It was adapted from Volker Kutscher\u2019s Weimar novels and directed by Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run (1998)), Hendrik Handloegten and Achim von Borries, whose biggest decision may have concerned what tone to adopt. Enfolding a political struggle that leads to horrific street battles between Communist workers and the police, the decadence of Berlin nightlife, scenes of extreme poverty, and the suspense of an espionage thriller joined to a potential romance, Babylon Berlin could not afford to be mired in solemnity on one hand or irreverence on the other. It had to be more accessible than Rainer Werner Fassbinder\u2019s experimental 14-part Berlin Alexanderplatz (1980) and more immediate than Edgar Reitz\u2019s moody and romantic Heimat (1984\u20132013), which stretches to 32 films. In the end, the filmmakers settled on a breezy observational style that is neither emotionally manipulative nor ironic. The viewer can make what they want of the debauchery\u200a\u2014\u200ano moral judgement is imposed. At one point, the hero, Special Investigator Gereon Rath (Volker Bruch), stumbles on a screening room where a producer is watching Marlene Dietrich\u2019s screen test for Josef von Sternberg\u2019s The Blue Angel (1930). Dietrich\u2019s awe-inspiring presence is a reminder that the pursuit of sex is one of the absurdest of human activities. Visually, there\u2019s a comic-book quality about the succession of heightened incidents, which barely allow the audience to draw breath. Police raid a studio where pornographic movies (one involving young boys) are being made. A Trotskyist cadre hijacks a Russian freight train bound for Berlin and attach a truck full of gold. Svetlana Sorokina (Severija Janu\u0161auskait\u0117), a cabaret performer in Dietrich drag, turns her act into an early rock concert that inspires audience line dancing\u200a\u2014\u200adid that really happen in Weimar Germany? There\u2019s an artificial equality to these scenes occasionally reminiscent of Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff\u2019s The Tin Drum (1979) and Fassbinder\u2019s Lili Marleen (1981), though Babylon Berlin is inevitably more televisual. Less artificial is the Dickensian depiction of squalor in which the heroine, Charlotte Ritter (Liv Lisa Fries), lives with her ailing mother, grandfather, sister and vile brother-in-law, and many younger siblings. Cumulatively, the series builds a picture of chaos. All that grounds it is the daily traffic of office workers rushing to and fro on Alexanderplatz\u200a\u2014\u200alife goes on despite the sense that Berlin is standing on a precipice. The show\u2019s success lies in its marrying of the sociopolitical and the personal. Investigator Gereon and police clerical temp (and would-be homicide detective) Charlotte are borne along by the unstoppable flow of crises even as they try to understand them and ferret out the mysteries of a missing porn film and a missing Trotskyist agitator, Alexej Kardakow (Ivan Shvedoff), whose bedeviled character apparently has nine lives. When Gereon and Charlotte kick up their heels at a gay nightclub, they are not simply bonding but actively participating in Weimar hedonism. They are not tangential to history\u200a\u2014\u200athey are two of its components. And each is compromised by history. Gereon\u200a\u2014\u200awho has been sent to Berlin to extricate Cologne\u2019s mayor from blackmail\u200a\u2014\u200afought on the Siegfried Line during World War. He suffers PTSD and takes shots of morphine, carried in phials in his pocket, when he gets the shakes; he and Charlotte meet cute in a men\u2019s toilet cubicle when he is having a fit. The only wage earner in her family, girl-about-town Charlotte supplements her income by working as a dominatrix in the brothel beneath her favorite nightclub. She is proudly \u201cnot a whore\u201d but is blackmailed by Gereon\u2019s fellow detective, Bruno Wolter (Peter Kurth), into having sex with him\u200a\u2014\u200aan unwelcome development\u200a\u2014\u200aand agreeing to inform on Gereon when she becomes his unofficial assistant. Part of the show\u2019s tension derives from whether or not she will betray Gereon. Babylon Berlin is major-event television and a satisfying binge watch. If it is less than gripping that is because Tykwer, Handloegten, and Borries cooly distance us from the action. How immersive one finds the series depends on how much one empathizes with Gereon and Charlotte, who may be components in history but are also protagonists in a vision of pre-Nazi Berlin that\u2019s part Fassbinder, part Max Beckmann. The reality, for most, was probably much harsher. Originally published at theculturetrip.com, where you can read more of Graham\u2019s work.

You won\u2019t, either, when it happens to you. It would be fair to say that I\u2019m proud of my thirty five year career in the computer industry. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of working with thousands of brilliant people and, thankfully, have learned a little bit from each of them. I was once a brash young engineer at NeXT Computer and, many years later, a Corporate Vice President at Microsoft. In a sense, two of the most important lessons I ever learned, I learned from Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. I was a sophomore in college before I took my first computer science class, at the recommendation of an uncle who thought: \u201cThis computer stuff is gonna be big.\u201d I was studying psychology at the time. I have no idea why. It was the best I could think of for a major when I entered college. I was set to graduate at seventeen, much too young to know what I wanted to do with my life. I was breezing through college and was completely bored with Psychology. It seemed like mental masturbation: just putting labels on people and on overlapping sets of vague symptoms. The fact that a single mental patient, when visited by five psychologists, will walk away with six diagnoses, is sufficient proof that psychology is more an art than a science. In the midst of all this, my first computer science class was a revelation. What? You mean there\u2019s only one right answer to the problem? You mean the computer will do exactly what I tell it to do? And if the code doesn\u2019t work, the problem is likely to be my own damn fault? Fuck, yeah! Sign me up! Here\u2019s a world that was much more satisfying than the vague world of psychology. So I did what every decent sixteen year old would do. I declared double major: Psychology and Computer Science. \u201cWhat the hell do those two topics have to do with each other?\u201d, you may ask. Nothing really. I just happened to have already taken most of the classes I needed for a bachelor\u2019s degree in Psychology and wasn\u2019t about to just give up on that! In the end, I still graduated at seventeen with both degrees and entered the workforce. Funny enough, having now managed thousands of people and worked with tens of thousands of others, I find myself remembering many lessons from those Psychology classes. Now they make sense, now that I\u2019ve seen dozens of examples of each symptom. Back then, I had no context. I hadn\u2019t experienced enough of life to have a frame of reference. As such, the concepts seemed just like a bunch of empty words. At the time I was a starving foreign student on an F-1 visa and, not having any immediate relatives in the country, my only path to permanent residency was to find an employer who would apply for a green card on my behalf. But there\u2019s a catch. As a foreign student in the US, you can only work for a year after graduation on what is called \u201cPractical Training\u201d. If you do a great job during that year, your employer applies for you, you get an H-1B visa which is then a path to a green card, citizenship, and the rest of the American Dream. If that doesn\u2019t happen, you\u2019re out of luck and you go back to your country of origin. I was not interested in going back to a country suffering through revolutionary turmoil and a pointless war. I was of conscription age and would have ended up fighting in the front lines of the Iran-Iraq war. No, thanks! So I desperately needed a job and a sponsor. The only job I could find was at my local state university as a Computer Science lab manager. What a bizarre job for someone trying to break into the industry as a software developer. Well, that\u2019s the best I could do at the time. This is 1982 we\u2019re talking about, after all. Height of the Iran hostage mania, the Iran-Iraq war, the oil crisis, recession, and all that. I won\u2019t bore you with the details. It was not a pretty picture. Here I was, fresh out of classes programming the latest model PDP-11 and Unix, having taken Artificial Intelligence classes writing code in LISP and Prolog, having studied heady theoretical automata theory\u2026 and you want me to do what? Load these trays of punch cards into this 1960\u2019s era IBM card punch reader and change dishwasher sized disks on aging VAX systems? And this will get me a green card? Okay, I\u2019m game. What the hell. It\u2019s only now, thirty five years later and a million miles away, that I\u2019m actually thankful for having gotten to experience an entire generation of computing. One that was dying, for sure, but also one that allows me to contrast today\u2019s world even more starkly with where we were, just a few years ago. Just think about it. Any kid can pick up a smartphone or tablet today, type in a question, any question, and get an instantaneous answer. Wow. Just fucking wow. Back in my day (can you hear the violin playing in the background?), we still had to go to the public library and use printed index cards to find reference books. Do we even realize how far our world has come in just the past few decades? Fast forward fifty years, at the exponential rate we have been experiencing, and you will see how far we\u2019ll go. I\u2019m an optimist about the future if only because I\u2019ve seen how fast this industry can move in the long run. Don\u2019t get me wrong. In the short term, it\u2019s nothing but frustration and tedium, bureaucracy and cat fights, bug fixes and meetings. But in the long run, oh my god! Just take a big step back and look at how dramatically we have changed the human experience in just the past ten or twenty years. I am a child of the sixties and seventies raised partly in a third world country. I still remember having to go to the national phone company office downtown and standing in line for an hour in order to make an international phone call. Today, anyone can connect with anyone else anywhere on the planet instantly through voice, video, email, and social media on a phone in their pocket. And they don\u2019t even need to drag an IBM card punch reader behind them or know Fortran to do so! Holy crap! Now that\u2019s progress. Of course, I didn\u2019t understand any of this at the time. I was just struggling to keep up with some of the best folks in the industry. It\u2019s only now that I see the consummation of all those things we worked on for so many years: the networking and security standards, the operating system platforms and ecosystems, the advances in usability and interoperability, reliability and scalability. I still have trouble getting my iPhone to work with Google Play when I visit a friend\u2019s home (talk about vendor lock-in) but, once we agree on a platform, we can choose from thousands of movies, millions of songs, and dozens of shared experiences whether we\u2019re in the same room or halfway across the world. Twenty years ago, none of this existed. Now that\u2019s progress and we all had a hand in it. It\u2019s only when you take a giant step backwards and see the impact our industry has had, as a whole, on humanity that you can feel happy about your contributions. Back to the story. There is no way a state university could legitimately apply for a green card for someone to be a lab manager, so I left after a short stint to find a better place. It took me three or four tries, at half baked startups and mediocre companies, to finally end up at a company where I could work on something I was passionate about: Operating Systems. And I\u2019ve never looked back. My entire 35 year career, before I finally retired last year, was spent working on operating systems, first as a Unix kernel developer and later as a manager, director, VP, and eventually CTO. I spent a few years writing device drivers on Sun workstations, then did a lot of Unix kernel work at a multiprocessor high end server company. I got to work with every architecture from Motorola to MIPS to PowerPC, writing system components, device drivers, storage subsystems, virtual memory management systems, low level kernel code, doing system bring up, even soldering parts on the factory floor when needed. I eventually made my way to the west coast and spent several years at MIPS and Silicon Graphics working on high end server systems. At its height, I worked on several supercomputer projects at Silicon Graphics. When I tell people that, they immediately say: \u201cAh, Jurassic Park!\u201d Well, yes. SGI was the company that built the graphics computers used for rendering many Hollywood movies, including Jurassic Park. But we also worked on supercomputers that competed directly with Cray Research for supremacy in the (then highly competitive) supercomputing world. Those were the heady days when I learned everything about computer architecture from the processor all the way up to operating systems and system software in general. I seem to have worked on a lot of dead end system architectures. Supercomputers, UNIX workstations, shared memory multiprocessor architectures, RISC processors, tightly coupled server clusters: all architectures that have mostly fallen by the wayside as the world has embraced personal computing, the cloud, and distributed computing. I used to fret about this. Why was I always killing myself on these herculean projects only to find out a few years later that a competitor had completely rethought the problem space and come up with a new generation of computing to address it? It was only later that I realized: That\u2019s probably true for almost everyone out there. Every architecture dies out sooner or later. That\u2019s just the way this industry works. I\u2019ve worked on many revolutionary projects\u200a\u2014\u200arevolutionary when I was working on them\u200a\u2014\u200aand every one of them has sooner or later been retired to the dustbin of history. Thankfully, with each generation we learn from the mistakes of the past. In the process, I also got an opportunity to work with some of the brightest minds in the industry and learn from them. The most important lessons took me years to learn. Case in point: I was the brash young engineer who quit from NeXT Computer in 1992 when Steve Jobs cancelled the project I was working on: a PowerPC based next generation dual processor workstation running NeXTStep. The project was almost finished, the system was ready to be shipped, and was due to be announced at an industry conference the following week when it was cancelled. I was so mad that I didn\u2019t even bother including the job experience on my resume! Steve tried to get me to stay at the company but I was too hot headed and angry to realize that he had made the right call. He had realized that the battle over processor architectures was over and Intel had won. He completely killed all hardware projects at NeXT and gave the company a software-only focus. I, of course, stormed out the door. How dare he cancel my project? I was too busy looking at the trees in front of me to see the forest all around me. The processor war was over. The correct answer was to move up the stack and innovate in software, not to keep fighting the processor war for an ever-shrinking slice of the market. Of course, he then returned to Apple with the NeXT team intact and the rest is history. That\u2019s what I mean when I say the hardest lessons take years to internalize. I wasn\u2019t thinking at that level. I was too emotional about the project I\u2019d just spent so much time and effort on. I couldn\u2019t be bothered to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. What I learned from Steve later\u200a\u2014\u200amuch later, after I had cooled down\u200a\u2014\u200awas to fight the right battles. Continuing to fight a battle after the war has already been lost is an exercise in futility. I was too stubborn to understand the lesson at the time but have internalized and used it many times since\u200a\u2014\u200amostly in scenarios that have nothing whatsoever to do with computer architecture. Later in my career, I spent a dozen years at Microsoft working on various versions of Windows. Now that you look back on it, you can see that Windows lost the mobile phone war to Apple, the server war to Linux, and the cloud war to Amazon. Back then, we were too busy pumping out versions of Windows to realize that. It\u2019s so hard to put into words the amount of organizational inertia that goes into an engineering team responsible for a successful platform being used by billions of people. They almost never see the disruption coming at them. Or if the leaders do, the rank and file don\u2019t. Most of them are too busy pushing the current rock up the mountain, the classic definition of \u201cInnovator\u2019s dilemma.\u201d This is not a complaint about the leadership of Windows or of Microsoft. By the end, I was one of those \u201cleaders\u201d, eventually responsible for all core development in Windows 7\u200a\u2014\u200aarguably the most popular version of Windows ever. I\u2019m proud of what we accomplished as a team. What I learned from Microsoft was how hard it is to build a successful platform that is used by billions of people, millions of apps, and thousands of companies. The more open you make it, the more programmable you make it, the more people that build stuff around and on top of it, the harder it is to innovate on that platform later. What I learned from Bill Gates during those years was an amazing attention to detail. The man could sit through fourteen hours of non-stop meetings where one team after another would prance through, covering topics as divergent as operating systems, productivity apps, the internet, watches, video games, research, email, databases, browsers\u200a\u2014\u200ayou name it. He could drill down into the details with the best of them. Impressive mental capacity. One of my favorite quotes is from the author Sam Harris: \u201cBoredom is just lack of attention.\u201d But I prefer to turn the phrase around into a positive statement that best summarizes the lesson I learned from Bill: If you pay enough attention, everything is interesting. What I learned from Bill later, at a distance, was that he was also a decent human being. He could take that brain and apply it to solving much harder problems\u200a\u2014\u200aeducation, poverty, disease. I can sit here and write yarns about what I learned from each of the other smart people I\u2019ve worked with over the years. That would take far more time than either you or I have and take up more pages than either of us would care to read\u200a\u2014\u200aor write. More importantly, it won\u2019t mean much unless you experience it for yourself. Most lessons are lost on us until it\u2019s too late for them to have an impact. What I can tell you as a piece of career advice is to only work on things you are passionate about. As long as you\u2019re learning, keep at it. There is so much to learn and this industry moves so quickly that you will fall behind if you stop learning even for an instant. As long as you\u2019re moving in the right general direction, I used to tell people, it\u2019s all good. Don\u2019t try to plan out your entire road trip from New York to LA before you start out. (If I\u2019d done that, I would have lived an entirely different life\u200a\u2014\u200anever having even signed up for that first computer science class.) Instead, on your way to LA, just make sure you\u2019re driving in a generally westerly direction, then keep going. And keep learning along the way, course correcting as necessary. You\u2019ll eventually end up in the right place; and you\u2019ll have a lot of fun along the way. I know I did.

It\u2019s kind of complicated, but it\u2019s incredibly valuable and insightful. I\u2019ll try to explain as much of it as I can in my own words, but we\u2019ll quote from a piece by Shane Mottishaw at The Knife Media (which also appeared here on Medium) laying it all out: The foundation of the Four Quadrant model is that there are two axes, X and Y, and they represent support for a given policy initiative, and moral virtue, respectively. The media routinely attempts to conflate the former with the latter\u200a\u2014\u200ain other words, \u201cif you don\u2019t support [given policy favored by the media], then you are a bad person.\u201d It is how the media denies the existence of any good faith debate. Let\u2019s use affirmative action as an example. The media\u2019s objective is to put themselves into the upper right corner and you, who oppose affirmative action, in the lower left corner. By the way\u200a\u2014\u200athis has nothing to do with the traditional left-right political spectrum. The media equates support for affirmative action with moral virtue (upper-right), and opposition to affirmative action with moral repugnance (lower-left). So if you say, \u201cI oppose affirmative action,\u201d then the media allows for only one possible explanation: you are evil. Nuanced arguments and points of view are unwelcome. The media is interested in painting in broad strokes and spinning simple narratives of Good vs. Evil. So you can\u2019t object, \u201cJust because I\u2019m against affirmative action does not make me a bad person!\u201d Sorry, not an option, buckaroo! The objective is to distort and mischaracterize your views and get you frustrated. The media would like you to lash out in anger, that way they can portray you as unhinged and ferocious. Because then that further underscores their original contention: that you are a bad person. Each of the four quadrants in the model have names. Going counter-clockwise from top-right: Doesn\u2019t this already feel like a revelation? Don\u2019t you already feel as if you have a far greater understanding of the political landscape? The Four Quadrant model is incredibly valuable. Basically, the media\u2019s game revolves around deception and mischaracterization. Here\u2019s Weinstein elaborating on it: He refers to the Jordan Peterson/Cathy Newman interview, in which the model was on full display. Newman, the dishonest leftist \u201cJournalist,\u201d repeatedly tried to portray Peterson as a troglodyte, and Peterson had to keep pushing back against her mischaracterization. Peterson would say something like \u201cThe gender pay gap exists because men and women are biologically different.\u201d And then Newman would try to put words in his mouth: \u201cSo you\u2019re saying women are inferior and should simply be paid less, period.\u201d Newman\u2019s position was: the only way out is total submission to my feminist agenda. She had her preferred policies in mind\u200a\u2014\u200aequal pay laws, further government intervention in the marketplace, whatever\u200a\u2014\u200aand had already long since decided that there would be no honest disagreement. Back to Weinstein: \u201cTying your virtue to a thwarting of your own interests.\u201d By this Weinstein is talking about your objective political interests\u200a\u2014\u200ai.e. good policies. The media has effectively made people choose between supporting objectively good policies or being seen as a good person. Which is a horribly evil thing to do. But, then again, what would I know? I\u2019m just a nasty troglodyte. Precisely. The Knife article has plenty of other examples demonstrating the Four Quadrant model. One is from 2014, when Sam Harris went on Bill Maher\u2019s show alongside Ben Affleck. Harris is very critical of Islam, and small-minded Ben Affleck was unable to comprehend that Harris could criticize Islam without being \u201cIslamophobic\u201d or bigoted. The examples go on and on. The common thread running through them, however, is that, \u201cIf you do not agree with me, you are a racist/sexist/Islamophobe etc.\u201d By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

That way, we don\u2019t spend two hours viewing more gore than we\u2019re in the mood for, and don\u2019t wind up accidentally bringing our kids to a profanity-laden flick. When we\u2019re shopping for food, we expect an ingredient list on the side of the package, with any allergens clearly spelled out. And news stations generally warn us when a segment contains intense descriptions, in case we want to shoo our kids (or ourselves) out of the room. Content information is not universally expected, though\u200a\u2014\u200anor is it universally respected. In 2016, the dean of the University of Chicago wrote a letter to incoming students, saying the campus does not support trigger warnings because they stifle freedom of expression and inquiry. The letter kicked off a public debate about such warnings that still hasn\u2019t entirely settled down. But what about writing groups and writing workshops? I\u2019ve been in a handful where content notes/warnings were either encouraged or required, and others in which they weren\u2019t used at all. Some writers resist the idea, and understandably so. When we share our work and are seeking feedback, we don\u2019t want to say anything that might put readers off. But writers often (and necessarily) dig deep into troubling events and feelings\u200a\u2014\u200aand sometimes those words can send readers to a pretty awful place, especially if they\u2019re not expecting it. That\u2019s not such a great place from which to offer feedback on a piece of writing. Empathy and compassion for others\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially others whose experiences differ from our own\u200a\u2014\u200ais a necessary skill for good writing. It helps us create realistic characters and believable narratives. Understanding the value of content warnings comes from having compassion and empathy for those with trauma in their backgrounds, and understanding that being triggered or made anxious by a given topic is more than just being \u201ctoo fragile.\u201d Trauma goes well beyond veterans who\u2019ve seen battle. It is especially common among women, as well as among members of any marginalized community\u200a\u2014\u200apeople of color, LGBTQ folks, disabled folks, and so on. To be respectful and inclusive, employing content warnings makes a lot of sense. But what to warn for? There\u2019s a sensible argument that we won\u2019t be able to guess everyone\u2019s triggers. Folks with trauma histories understand that. But there are a bunch of basic, broad categories of material that are most likely to bring up awful feelings for some readers, especially if they\u2019re not expecting them. Here\u2019s a list of things that are worth warning readers about: Here are a couple of further guidelines, borrowed from the Geek Feminism wiki: Wording: A trigger warning usually takes the form of some emphasized (usually bold) text starting with a warning phrase (such as \u201ctrigger warning,\u201d \u201ccontent warning,\u201d or just \u201cwarning\u201d) and describing in broad terms the upsetting nature of the content. There is no consensus on the \u2018best\u2019 way to word a trigger warning so that it accurately describes the potentially-triggering content without becoming a trigger itself. The phrase \u201ctrigger warning\u201d may itself be triggering to some trauma survivors. People can also be triggered by warnings that include too much detail. Warnings with very general language, such as \u201cWarning for a graphic depiction of sexual violence\u201d or \u201cContent Warning: disordered eating\u201d are less likely to trigger readers than warnings that include specific details about the triggering content. All trigger warnings should respect autonomy. Present factual information about upcoming triggers, but don\u2019t imply that people are obliged to remove themselves from triggers, suggest or prescribe particular self-care mechanisms to other people, suggest that any particular group of vulnerable people (eg, sexual assault survivors) are not allowed to view your material at all or imply that the only people who might want to use caution are people with a certain background (sexual assault survivor) or diagnosis (post-traumatic stress disorder), as a wide range of people may be affected.

The temperature was just right, my mood was just right, the silence was just right, my chair was just right, and everything else was either irrelevant or perfectly poised. The stage was set. Another day, another story. I was staring at the screen, but there was a problem. My fingers weren\u2019t moving. I had no idea what I was going to write about. My mind was paralyzed. I wanted to shut it down and just call it an off day. My confirmation bias engine was revving hard, throwing a consistent stream of thoughts like \u201cHey you don\u2019t have to do it every day\u201d at me, and my mind was (obviously) buying all of that. The result? No post that day, and a considerable amount of trouble sleeping that night. One of the things I hate the most is regret, and I was battling with it hard that day. And I know I\u2019m not the only one. I don\u2019t think I know any artist who never feels that he/she\u2019s not extremely enthusiastic about creating all the time. As I lied in my bed that day, staring out the window at a relatively bland view on a pleasingly cold night, my decision to have taken another \u201coff\u201d day ate away at me. I knew that I was allowed to take breaks, but I also knew that I could easily have published a new story that day. \u201cBut what could I do?\u201d, I asked myself. I was still stuck in that memory\u200a\u2014\u200astaring at my laptop, feeling paralyzed and totally incapable of coming up with a new idea and the will to write. I couldn\u2019t do afford to continue having these blocks, and I knew that. I knew very well that I was respecting my mind by giving it ample deep time, and that any further blocks would just translate to a lack of will and inspiration. And I do not want to go down as a person who has no fire in him. This was a long time ago. Things are different now. I post much more often now. I almost post daily, and my streaks are only broken when I get too high off my accomplishments, I write something which I save for posting later, or it is actually impossible for me to write that day. Comparing my new work with my past work, I can tell you this: I have a lot of people hit me up on Twitter and e-mail, asking me how I manage to post so often. Honestly, I still believe that I\u2019m not nearly as productive as I can be. I still believe that I can still post way more and way better articles. I realized that the reason why most people don\u2019t post as often as they really can basically boils down to one major thing. That \u201cthing\u201d isn\u2019t laziness, lack of willpower, or the need of breaks. That \u201cthing\u201d is We are the creators of our own cages. Right from when I started writing on Medium a couple months ago, I\u2019ve believed that I can get out five stories in five (or less) hours of work. I\u2019m yet to attain that level of productivity, but having that stretch goal ensures that I never put a cap on my productivity, that I don\u2019t build my own cage. That is exactly what too many people do. They plant this notion in their heads that posting every day is an enormous and insurmountable difficulty. When they do that, they solidify their own ceilings. They set their own limits. They build their own cages. If the same people completely got rid of this notion and started believing that they actually can post twice a day, they would post maybe once a day and still feel like they have much more to offer. Or better yet, the same people would start posting twice a day. The same people, just different perspectives. The same high potential, just different notions\u200a\u2014\u200aand hence, better performance. It\u2019s just like how computers work. Even if you have the best hardware in the world, if it is written in your software to only use a tiny amount of your resources, you\u2019ll only end up being limited to a tiny amount of your potential. The good news is that us humans get to write our own code. We get to frame our own mindset. We can choose to get rid of our limiting notions and break free from cages we\u2019ve built for ourselves\u200a\u2014\u200aleading to much happier, productive and successful lives. And it all starts with a decision. A decision to change the way you see the idea of frequent posting. Deciding to change your idea of how much posting is \u201cenough\u201d. Deciding to break free from your own cages. This simple decision will help you lead a much better life. Will you take it? You using your time to read my work means the world to me. I fully mean that.

Gwynneth in the Smoking Jacket? That was Tom. Low key, sexy and chic. So what happened here? The New York Times doesn\u2019t like it. Their headline says \u201cTom Ford Loses His Cool.\u201d\u00a0Robin Givhan, who has a Pulitzer in Fashion hates this. She really, really hates it. This collection is many things, but cool isn\u2019t one of them. They have a retro \u201980s look as seen by someone who wasn\u2019t really there. These outfits look like Tom found them by time travelling to a clearance rack at Express or Tellos sometime in the summer of 1985.The door knocker earrings are least of his problems (Take the earrings out girls. Seriously.)I will not discuss the pussy purse. Don\u2019t @ me. BUTI have a theory. In this bizarre homage to the \u201980s, Ford recalls the era of Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and Imelda Marcos. But it was also the era of The Sex Pistols, The Ramones, Blondie and The Clash. It was a messy, confusing hodge-podge of neon leggings, big shouldered power suits and Cyndi Lauper chic. Ford seems to have hurled bits of these varying aesthetics together into what Givhan says is \u201cAt minimum, the collection feels like a reflection of the times: uncivil, loud, chaotic, overwhelming, exhausting\u200a\u2014\u200aand wholly, utterly, grotesquely vulgar.\u201d Vogue tried to like it, but even they couldn\u2019t quite get there. \u201cIrreverent to the edge of defiance,\u201d they said. Ford has to know what his collection looks like. After all, he\u2019s Tom Ford. I suspect Tom doesn\u2019t really care if we like it or dislike it. I don\u2019t even think he cares if it sells. There\u2019s a chance Tom has something bigger in mind. This is Performance art by Tom Ford. Perhaps Tom is using fashion to make a statement about the vulgar men destroying the US government brick by brick and their greedy, garish, gold-digging wives. Someday, all the history students will be writing about this. I think Tom is fed up\u200a\u2014\u200alike everybody else. And this is his pink-hat political statement. This strange, loud mishmash of outfits that looks like it was pulled from a give-away bin behind a Goodwill shop could be Tom\u2019s way of crazy, sexy, cool has been replaced by stupid, sleazy and tacky. So what we have here is a vulgar, garish, uncool, irreverent to the edge of defiance collection that reflects our vulgar, garish, uncool, defiant to the edge new normal in the United States. When \u2018Hamilton\u2019s Lin- Manuel Miranda released a single to help victims of the earthquake in Puerto Rico, he said he wanted to help and looked at his particular skill set to see what he had to offer. The answer, of course, was music. In the case of Tom Ford, his particular skill set is a fashion and the many critical eyes around the world focused on this collection of what Project Runway\u2019s Nina Garcia would call \u201cquestionable taste.\u201d When you look at it that way, it works and it\u2019s beautiful\u00a0.

But just like a muscle, it can also get used to the same exercises if you aren\u2019t careful to change things up every now and then. If you\u2019re ever stuck in a rut, try one of these: Legend has it J.K. Rowling began her fateful journey to creating the Harry Potter series by writing notes on paper napkins. Whether that\u2019s true or not, it is a great exercise to jot down ideas that are very meaningful. Do you know how annoying it is to write on a napkin? It\u2019s not a great surface. Which makes what you write all that more special. Go to a diner, order a cup of coffee, and try it. This is one of my favorite (and standard) \u201ccreative\u201d muscle workouts. Every day, write down 10 ideas you think would be fun to pursue. Don\u2019t worry about how long they would take to make, budget, or whether or not they are realistic in any way\u200a\u2014\u200ajust let your mind wander and see what it believes it could make real. You\u2019ll be surprised how, after a few days, you\u2019ll be flooded with great ideas. This is like approaching creativity backwards. Next time you\u2019re in a meeting and everyone is all, \u201cLet\u2019s write down all our best ideas,\u201d if you get stuck, try going the other direction. Write down anything and everything that \u201ccouldn\u2019t possibly work.\u201d Funny how this often leads to an obvious and brilliant solution that \u201cjust might be crazy enough to work.\u201d This is an exercise I learned in college while taking a poetry class. To emphasize the importance of minimalism, we were instructed to write poems with our non-dominant hand. What happens when you do this is you get so frustrated by how slow (and sloppy) you are writing that you actually subconsciously delete words for the sake of getting to the heart of what you actually want to say. The end result? A wildly short and yet provocative piece. Try it\u200a\u2014\u200awith anything. Even if you are not an illustrator, there is something about using symbols and stick figures to communicate your message instead of words. Whether you are trying to figure out how to organize a proposal, a chapter of your book, a presentation, etc., try drawing your idea instead of writing it out. The words will practically reveal themselves. This is another helpful exercise I\u2019ve learned through studying poetry. Instead of sitting in front of your notepad and trying to get everything down on paper, construct your message by memory in your head. If you stick with this long enough, two things happen. First, you automatically delete anything that isn\u2019t vibrant enough to be remembered (a positive), and second, you keep things short and concise because otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be able to remember it. Then, once you\u2019ve got it all the way you want it, write it down. Give it a voice. Sometimes sitting in silence with your brain running laps ends up working against you. Hear it. Feel it. Play with it and work with it. Writers especially, read your work out loud. I promise, you\u2019ll come up with some amazing material by using your real voice as a tool. Just a pen, no notepad. If something really great hits you, write it on your hand. Again, a test in brevity here: When we carry around notebooks we sometimes feel compelled to jot down everything that comes to mind. But if you only have a pen and your tablet is your hand, then you will be more mindful of what you ultimately choose to write down. Brevity tends to reveal the most simple (and best) material anyway. This was one of our tactics when I worked at Idea Booth. For big campaigns, we gather the whole team around our big table and we hold an \u201cidea storm.\u201d One person stands at the head of the room (where the walls are painted with idea paint\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can write on them with dry erase marker), and as people contribute ideas, they all get written down on the board. After about 15 minutes, we step back and circle the best ones, and then as a group we dive deep and expand on each one, sharing out loud how we would bring them to life. I mean, so simple but so undervalued. Too many people try to be creative in a vacuum. They sit in a room by themselves and tap their pencil on their desk and wait for brilliance to strike. It doesn\u2019t really happen like that. Read about what other people have done in that particular niche, read case studies, read about the history of whatever you are looking to solve, etc. Read, and the answer will reveal itself. Again, extremely undervalued and rarely done because it is a challenge, but the results always speak for themselves. Next time you find yourself in a creative rut, take a Saturday, wake up early, and fall off the grid. Turn off your phone and put it in your closet. Don\u2019t open your laptop. Spend your entire day detached from the digital world, and every time you get that \u201cinkling\u201d to do something or you get bored, journal or go for a walk or read instead. I promise you, come afternoon you\u2019ll be flooded with ideas. We all have that friend we share everything with. Well, use them as a resource. If you\u2019re struggling with an idea, invite them over, pull out the whiteboard, sit them down, and say, \u201cLook, I just need to think through this out loud. Let me explain what I\u2019m thinking, and then you provide me with any feedback or ideas.\u201d By the time you\u2019re done explaining the challenge, chances are you\u2019ll have realized the answer yourself. That\u2019s really what social media is used for\u200a\u2014\u200aconversation. Instead of spending three months bashing your head against the wall trying to come up with \u201cthe perfect idea,\u201d just start testing and sharing things on social media and see what people respond to. Brainstorm by interacting with people and adjust as you go along, based on feedback. This can be extremely jarring but it can also be really effective. If you\u2019re used to getting up at 6 or 7 a.m., try getting up at 3 or 4 in the morning, pitch black, and starting your day then. This is not for the faint of heart, but there is something to be said for drastically adjusting your surroundings to spark your creativity. As a musician, I tend to do this a lot as a cross-training exercise: I take something I am working on writing and compose the same story through music (piano, an instrumental, a song, etc.). This is another challenge in keeping things concise, and also tends to reveal a lot about the underlying emotions of what it is you\u2019re creating. Music is, after all, a language. If you\u2019re ever struggling to figure out how to say something, or who it is you\u2019re \u201ctalking to\u201d with what you\u2019re creating, image it as a letter to one person. What do they look like? How old are they? What do they want to hear? Write as if you are speaking to them and them only, and watch the voice reveal itself naturally. And finally, the real secret to all creative brainstorming is to do it regularly\u200a\u2014\u200aevery day, no matter what. That\u2019s how you keep that muscle engaged and alive.

Having missed most of my classes, and barely studied, I received a D in math and an F for French (which I think is funny). I\u2019m a little embarrassed to even write about this, and I\u2019ll try to redeem myself by letting you know that four of my nine grades were C: for physics, biology, English language, and English literature. Any small success I had was basically down to luck, and it was terrifying to take those exams with no preparation. It\u2019s only in the last few years that I stopped having nightmares about it. This is when I hit rock-bottom, a pivot point at which I decided to turn my life around. I studied hard until I was 18, got into a relatively good \u201cred-brick\u201d university (the University of Reading, pronounced \u201credding\u201d), and ended up with a first-class honors degree in electronic engineering. I also went on to get a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from Stanford, one of the top universities in the world, and to become a world-class computer processor designer and architect. I\u2019m the inventor of at least ten patents in the field. All of this is not to brag (well, maybe a little), but to show how significantly I was able to turn my life around, and so qualify what I am about to write next: persistence is the most important skill that you can acquire. Now I\u2019ll explain why. By the time I was 16, the headmaster (principal) of my school had decided, because I had been performing so poorly, that I did not have an academic temperament. In fact, as I later proved, the problems were unrelated to my ability to handle academic subjects; they were emotional and social. Because of this, he recommended that I go to a technical college, and study for a vocational qualification. I went to Brooklands Technical College in Weybridge, and I studied (trained) to get a B.Tech National Diploma in engineering. I\u2019m so grateful that I took this unusual path. I learned to solder electronic components to boards and to weld pieces of metal together using both oxygen-acetyline and electric arc. I learned to use machine tools to turn, drill, and mill blocks of metal into useful things. I programmed computer-controlled milling machines to repeatably carve precise shapes out of metal. I learned to run high-level programs on a mainframe, and also to program micro-controllers in low-level assembly language. For my final project, at 18, I designed and built an analog audio mixer, including custom-etched printed circuit boards and a custom case. Even though I went on to become a Chartered Engineer, I started with the training of a technician. I\u2019m very grateful to the college and to my teachers there, and also to my headmaster for sending me down the wrong path. The one that I feel the most gratitude for was my math teacher. I haven\u2019t been able to find her name in my records. She had a very strong Northern accent, and would pronounce syllabus as \u201csilly boose.\u201d She started out by defining terms clearly. I remember her writing on the blackboard that she used the abbreviation \u201c+ve\u201d to mean positive and \u201c-ve\u201d to mean negative. She was an extraordinary teacher, and took the time to slow down and explain things carefully. She made sure that her students understood thoroughly before moving on, and she was clearly very interested in what she was teaching. She was very motivational, warm, and understanding. If you know her name or can put me in contact with her, please let me know. She re-taught me everything I needed to know in math, up to an including what I would need in undergraduate level engineering at university, especially calculus. It was really hard at the beginning. I understood so little, and I felt totally incompetent. But this is where the persistence paid off. I bought thick books of engineering math problems, and I worked through the problems one-by-one. Sometimes I stayed up all night solving these math problems. I discovered that as my competence increased, my confidence also increased, and so did my natural excitement about math. The more excited I got, the more effortlessly I applied myself to practice. I got distinctions in my math subjects, and mostly distinctions for all the other subjects on my course. I also went back and took my math GCSE, with absolutely no revision, and I got a B. I didn\u2019t get an A only because there were some topics on the exam that I had never spent any time on; I think that set theory was one of those topics. This is the nature of mastery: the better we get, the better we\u2019re able to get. To practice something intensely, we have to be passionate about it. To be passionate about something, we need to have some level of competence or mastery. This means that we always start out as beginners in a catch-22 situation. It\u2019s hard to be motivated to apply ourselves fully when we\u2019re so incompetent, but we can\u2019t get competent and benefit from natural, intrinsic motivation, until we have developed some level of competence. The saving grace is wisdom. I know, from long experience, that if I want to get good at anything, I have to decide, with a strong determination, to apply myself to developing a seed of mastery in it. Once that seed has started to sprout, I know that I will become increasingly naturally engaged with the subject or skill. You may already know this from your own experience, and perhaps reading about it here will give you more confidence to act on that wisdom. Or perhaps this is a new idea for you, and now you\u2019re getting to learn from all of what I\u2019ve been though, without having to perform as many life experiments. Speaking of math, this seems to be the principle that automatically underlies the superiority of Asian children in math. According to Matthew Syed in the book Bounce, Asian children have an automatic advantage in math that is baked into the languages they speak. In most Asian languages, spoken numbers are composed simply, as in three-one-four (for 314), compared with three-hundred-and-fourteen in English. Also, all the numbers from zero to nine in most Asian languages are represented by one syllable each. English has seven (two syllables), plus all the other anomalous number words like eleven, twelve, seventeen, twenty, ninety, etc. This language simplicity translates into easy mental arithmetic for small children, which quickly gives them a higher base confidence and competence with math than comparably-aged non-Asian children. That competence and confidence feeds a cascade of growing mastery in math. Rather than sitting around waiting to die so that we can be reincarnated as Asian children, we can proactively bootstrap the process of learning and mastery any time we want. We can use the planning and abstract thinking faculties of our highly evolved neocortices to trick our less evolved parts, such as our important emotional system, into coming along with us on the path to mastery. You can do this at any age, from sixteen to sixty. Here are some tricks you can use to bootstrap mastery. I\u2019m pretty good at writing now, and I\u2019m getting better. I practice every day from around 6:30 am until roughly 8:00 am. I get up and I practice during that time. I also produce a lot of high quality content in that time. It\u2019s easy for me to do this now, because I have a lot of competence, and I find it extremely enjoyable to write. I know it would have been even easier for me to get here quickly if I had followed a schedule like this earlier. There are also several subjects that I am studying, including quantum physics and deep learning (which is related to artificial intelligence). My time to focus on these subjects is when I get home from work. The first thing I do is watch a lecture, or read part of a book, or do some coding. I increasingly look forward to that time every day. Setting a lower limit on the amount of time you will spend on mastering a given skill helps you to quickly bootstrap enough competence that it will become self-sustaining. As some point, you will no longer be able to stop yourself from practicing, and sometimes you will have to force yourself to stop practicing. To begin with, however, a big part of bootstrapping is to decide on a minimum amount of time, and then stick to it. I recommend using my life bootstrapping system to help with this. One of the challenges with this is figuring out how to keep going for the set amount of time. A classic example is with writing, where people get stuck and don\u2019t know what to write. To release any form of creative blockage like this, I recommend doing morning pages, as taught by Julia Cameron in her book The Artist\u2019s Way. This involves writing out (reporting) your stream-of-consciousness for a set period of time, and without stopping. If you\u2019re stuck then you write about being stuck. If you hate morning pages, then you write about hating morning pages. Morning pages is a generic way of unblocking creative flow. In general, if you\u2019re struggling with how to keep going with any project, then you have to trust that there is some way forward, and spend effort and time looking for it. That effort and time is actually part of the process of moving towards mastery in your chosen area. Learn to notice and appreciate micro-mastery. These are tiny little things that you achieve which are like bricks in a building. You might read a chapter in a book and realize that you thoroughly applied yourself to understanding it, and so you managed to understand more of it than you had expected. You might construct a particularly skillful sentence about sentience and then celebrate your cerebrum with alternating alliteration. You might persist in practice through a challenging period, or achieve one tiny part of a skill, even if you then seemed to have \u201clost\u201d it again (it\u2019s always there, getting stronger). The more you focus on what is working, and on what you appreciate, the more of it you will have. Find the mastery you already have, and enjoy and appreciate it. Your positive attitude towards that seed of mastery will nourish it and it will grow, blossom, and transform into full-blown, world-class mastery. Many processes in the natural world follow an exponential growth trajectory, and learning and mastery seem to as well. This is probably because at each stage future development is informed by all previous development. So the amount that you learn on day ten will not be the same as the amount you learned on day one, it will be more. Also, in the early stages of learning a new skill, the gains are often not large enough to produce clearly visible results. You might just be beginning to understand a concept, and, though you cannot even articulate it to yourself, that piece of learning will form part of the foundation upon which all of your future development rests. This kind of tiny but exponential early growth, growth that is hard to even perceive, is the foundation of mastery. This is the growth that we need to trust is there, and continue to develop and build upon until it unexpectedly pops into visibility one day. Just knowing about this is going to help you to persist. Intrinsic motivation is a desire to perform an action simply because it is enjoyable. Most actions lead to desired or undesired outcomes, and we can be motivated to perform actions in an attempt to obtain a desired outcome or to prevent an undesired outcome. However, the most satisfying way to live life is to enjoy the process from moment-to-moment. This is another way of saying that the ultimate goal of life is to focus on the process, and not on the outcome. This is the root teaching of many spiritual traditions, including, most clearly, the Bhagavad Gita: \u201cYou have the right to work only, but never to its fruits.Let not the fruits of action be your motive, nor let your attachment be to inaction.\u201d This is often considered to apply to meditation practice, but it applies to everything. This is generic wisdom, capturing a fundamental principle of life. The only thing we have is the present moment, and all of our power lies in where we direct our attention right now. It turns out that mastery is characterized by this process orientation. Anyone who is world-class at anything is 100% focused on the process of what they are doing, while they are doing it. They don\u2019t do it because they expect to get some positive outcome from doing it. They are in flow, and they are fully committed. They are motivated only by the deep joy of merging and becoming one with the object of their mastery, whether that is the sensation of the breath in their nostrils, or the feeling of the brush moving over the canvas. By practicing focusing on the process, and therefore turning the attention away from any anticipated end result, we not only commandeer all of our conscious attention and power, enabling it to be harnessed for the production of an optimal outcome, but we also maximize learning. In the process, we are bootstrapping the pathway to mastery by acting \u201cas if\u201d we are already masters. We engage with the process, at whatever level of mastery we have attained, as a master would. A master steps in and engages fully with whatever is present. A great example of this principle is Salman Khan, the creator of Khan Academy. He is a master teacher, perhaps one of the best in the world. It\u2019s possible to see him in action just by watching one of his videos on a relatively simple subject. Notice how he fully engages with the topic with deep interest. He is demonstrating beginner\u2019s mind. He is teaching by learning. He is re-teaching himself as he teaches. I\u2019m sure that he became a master teacher by teaching himself before he taught others. Persistence is key. Keep persisting and refer back to this article to stay on track.

We\u2019re excited to announce the 400,000+ high-resolution photos on Unsplash are now available in Medium. If you\u2019re writing a story on Medium and you want to add a photo, simply click the search icon and select the photo you want. After you pick a photo, the photo credit links to the photographer will appear automatically. Also, the team at Medium has taken the extra care to re-size photos so they fit perfectly in the layout of your story. This partnership with Medium holds special meaning for me and the Unsplash team. Six years ago, I heard about a new website called Medium from former Twitter Founder/CEO Ev Williams. Back then, Medium.com was just this one webpage. I had no idea what it was going to be but, I knew it was run by Ev, and he had a history of making world-changing products. I signed up. A few months later, an early version of Medium was shown to the world: A place to share ideas and experiences to move humanity forward. Then, Medium opened up access for members to write and I got my invite. I felt intimidated. The writing on Medium was so good, I wasn\u2019t sure I could write something worthy of the platform. Under self-imposed pressure, I thought about having a coffee or a beer to spark some inspiration. After a while, I realized I couldn\u2019t think about anything better to write about than this coffee or beer drink decision so I said screw it, and wrote about that. A few hours later, I published Coffee vs. beer: which drink makes you more creative? Coincidently, two days before I wrote this story\u00a0, we created Unsplash, a photography website where we shared 10 high-resolution photos that you could use for anything. I used one the first 10 Unsplash photos as the top image for the story: I didn\u2019t have much of an audience and I didn\u2019t know how many people would be interested in my story. So I didn\u2019t expect much. But then, my story became the most recommended story on Medium. I was freaking out. Building an audience is supposed to take months or years yet, Medium brought an audience for my writing in an instant. Knowing people cared about what I had to say gave me the motivation to focus on writing for the first time in my life. That year, I wrote a story every week on Medium. Today, I\u2019ve published 63 stories that have been read 475,000 times. Apart from Medium bringing an audience to my stories and photos on Unsplash, it seemed like Unsplash became useful for writers on Medium. I began to see Unsplash photos accompany many Medium stories. Even to this day, many of the recommended stories on Medium have Unsplash photos in them. Unsplash was recommended by the Medium design team and even provided the photography for the homepage of Medium at one point. As a frequent writer and reader of the Medium community, I always felt there was a the potential for a relationship between Medium and Unsplash someday. The two just fit too well together. This is why I am so excited for today\u2019s Medium + Unsplash partnership. Medium is the most inspiring writing and reading platform I\u2019ve ever been part of. It plays a meaningful role in moving many ideas forward no matter where those ideas come from. My hope is we can help play a role in moving these ideas forward by adding an impactful visual component to them. Medium is a megaphone for ideas. And my hope is Unsplash can help turn up the volume even more. I\u2019m honored to have the opportunity to partner with a community, product, and team as wonderful as Medium\u2019s.

Don\u2019t worry! Everything will be fine! It\u2019s not that bad!\u201d I would look at you politely, and then say gently, \u201cTo tell you the truth, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re taking collapse nearly seriously enough.\u201d Why? When we take a hard look at US collapse, we see a number of social pathologies on the rise. Not just any kind. Not even troubling, worrying, and dangerous ones. But strange and bizarre ones. Unique ones. Singular and gruesomely weird ones I\u2019ve never really seen before, and outside of a dystopia written by Dickens and Orwell, nor have you, and neither has history. They suggest that whatever \u201cnumbers\u201d we use to represent decline\u200a\u2014\u200ashrinking real incomes, inequality, and so on \u2014we are in fact grossly underestimating what pundits call the \u201chuman toll\u201d, but which sensible human beings like you and I should simply think of as the overwhelming despair, rage, and anxiety of living in a collapsing society. Let me give you just five examples of what I\u2019ll call the social pathologies of collapse\u200a\u2014\u200astrange, weird, and gruesome new diseases, not just ones we don\u2019t usually see in healthy societies, but ones that we have never really seen before in any modern society. America has had 11 school shootings in the last 23 days. That\u2019s one every other day, more or less. That statistic is alarming enough\u200a\u2014\u200abut it is just a number. Perspective asks us for comparison. So let me put that another way. America has had 11 school shootings in the last 23 days, which is more than anywhere else in the world, even Afghanistan or Iraq. In fact, the phenomenon of regular school shootings appears to be a unique feature of American collapse\u200a\u2014\u200ait just doesn\u2019t happen in any other country\u200a\u2014\u200aand that is what I mean by \u201csocial pathologies of collapse\u201d: a new, bizarre, terrible disease striking society. Why are American kids killing each other? Why doesn\u2019t their society care enough to intervene? Well, probably because those kids have given up on life\u200a\u2014\u200aand their elders have given up on them. Or maybe you\u2019re right\u200a\u2014\u200aand it\u2019s not that simple. Still, what do the kids who aren\u2019t killing each other do? Well, a lot of them are busy killing themselves. So there is of course also an \u201copioid epidemic\u201d. We use that phrase too casually, but it much more troubling than it appears on first glance. Here is what is really curious about it. In many countries in the world\u200a\u2014\u200amost of Asia and Africa\u200a\u2014\u200aone can buy all the opioids one wants from any local pharmacy, without a prescription. You might suppose then that opioid abuse as a mass epidemic would be a global phenomenon. Yet we don\u2019t see opioid epidemics anywhere but America\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially not ones so vicious and widespread they shrink life expectancy. So the \u201copioid epidemic\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200amass self-medication with the hardest of hard drugs\u200a\u2014\u200ais again a social pathology of collapse: unique to American life. It is not quite captured in the numbers, but only through comparison\u200a\u2014\u200aand when we see it in global perspective, we get a sense of just how singularly troubled American life really is. Why would people abuse opioids en masse unlike anywhere else in the world? They must be living genuinely traumatic and desperate lives, in which there is little healthcare, so they have to self-medicate the terror away. But what is so desperate about them? Well, consider another example: the \u201cnomadic retirees\u201d. They live in their cars. They go from place to place, season after season, chasing whatever low-wage work they can find\u200a\u2014\u200aspring, an Amazon warehouse, Christmas, Walmart. Now, you might say\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cwell, poor people have always chased seasonal work!\u201d But that is not really the point: absolute powerlessness and complete indignity is. In no other country I can see do retirees who should have been able to save up enough to live on now living in their cars in order to find work just to go on eating before they die\u200a\u2014\u200anot even in desperately poor ones, where at least families live together, share resources, and care for one another. This is another pathology of collapse that is unique to America\u200a\u2014\u200autter powerlessness to live with dignity. Numbers don\u2019t capture it\u200a\u2014\u200abut comparisons paint a bleak picture. How did America\u2019s elderly end up cheated of dignity? After all, even desperately poor countries have \u201cinformal social support systems\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aotherwise known as families and communities. But in America, there is the catastrophic collapse of social bonds. Extreme capitalism has blown apart American society so totally that people cannot even care for one another as much as they do in places like Pakistan and Nigeria. Social bonds, relationships themselves, have become unaffordable luxuries, more so than even in poor countries: this is yet another social pathology unique to American collapse. Yet those once poor countries are making great strides. Costa Ricans now have higher life expectancy than Americans\u200a\u2014\u200abecause they have public healthcare. American life expectancy is falling, unlike nearly anywhere else in the world, save the UK\u200a\u2014\u200abecause it doesn\u2019t. And that is my last pathology: it is one of the soul, not one of the limbs, like the others above. American appear to be quite happy simply watching one another die, in all the ways above. They just don\u2019t appear to be too disturbed, moved, or even affected by the four pathologies above: their kids killing each other, their social bonds collapsing, being powerless to live with dignity,or having to numb the pain of it all away. If these pathologies happened in any other rich country\u200a\u2014\u200aeven in most poor ones\u200a\u2014\u200apeople would be aghast, shocked, and stunned, and certainly moved to make them not happen. But in America, they are, well, not even resigned. They are indifferent, mostly. So my last pathology is a predatory society. A predatory society doesn\u2019t just mean oligarchs ripping people off financially. In a truer way, it means people nodding and smiling and going about their everyday business as their neighbours, friends, and colleagues die early deaths in shallow graves. The predator in American society isn\u2019t just its super-rich\u200a\u2014\u200abut an invisible and insatiable force: the normalization of what in the rest of the world would be seen as shameful, historic, generational moral failures, if not crimes, becoming mere mundane everyday affairs not to be too worried by or troubled about. Perhaps that sounds strong to you. Is it? Now that I\u2019ve given you a few examples\u200a\u2014\u200athere are many more\u200a\u2014\u200aof the social pathologies of collapse, let me share with you the three points that they raise for me. These social pathologies are something like strange and gruesome new strains of disease infecting the body social. America has always been a pioneer\u200a\u2014\u200aonly today, it is host not just to problems not just rarely seen in healthy societies\u200a\u2014\u200ait is pioneering novel social pathologies have never been seen in the modern world outside present-day America, period. What does that tell us? American collapse is much more severe than we suppose it is. We are underestimating its magnitude, not overestimating it. American intellectuals, media, and thought doesn\u2019t put any of its problems in global or historical perspective\u200a\u2014\u200abut when they are seen that way, America\u2019s problems are revealed to be not just the everyday nuisances of a declining nation, but something more like a body suddenly attacked by unimagined diseases. Seen accurately. American collapse is a catastrophe of human possibility without modern parallel\u00a0. And because the mess that America has made of itself, then, is so especially unique, so singular, so perversely special\u200a\u2014\u200athe treatment will have to be novel, too. The uniqueness of these social pathologies tell us that American collapse is not like a reversion to any mean, or the downswing of a trend. It is something outside the norm. Something beyond the data. Past the statistics. It is like the meteor that hit the dinosaurs: an outlier beyond outliers, an event at the extreme of the extremes. That is why our narratives, frames, and theories cannot really capture it\u200a\u2014\u200amuch less explain it. We need a whole new language\u200a\u2014\u200aand a new way of seeing\u200a\u2014\u200ato even begin to make sense of it. But that is America\u2019s task, not the world\u2019s. The world\u2019s task is this. Should the world follow the American model\u200a\u2014\u200aextreme capitalism, no public investment, cruelty as a way of life, the perversion of everyday virtue\u200a\u2014\u200athen these new social pathologies will follow, too. They are new diseases of the body social that have emerged from the diet of junk food\u200a\u2014\u200ajunk media, junk science, junk culture, junk punditry, junk economics, people treating one another and their society like junk\u200a\u2014\u200athat America has fed upon for too long.

Because when you shut your mouth for the sake of other people\u2019s feelings, you become invisible. Your voice becomes a faint whisper.

I wanted to talk about my feelings. About the dark moments of my life. About things that tick me off. But most of all, I just wanted to be myself. But of course, when you start expressing your thoughts with curse words or you unleash a sensitive topic, SOMEBODY gets upset.

Here are tips for a healthy submission strategy that will increase your odds of getting your work published. How To Get Your Writing Published Do your research. When writers don\u2019t do the necessary groundwork before submitting their work to editors or agents, it announces that they aren\u2019t serious about their careers. Get to know the industry and research the right magazines or agents for your work before you submit. Submit strong work. You read regularly and voraciously. You\u2019ve spent time in workshops, lectures, and seminars at writing conferences. You\u2019re developing a sense of confidence in your writing that is starting to show\u200a\u2014\u200aand that kind of confidence will attract the attention of industry professionals! Follow industry etiquette. Along with mastering your craft, you\u2019ve put in the time to learn the rules of submitting to agents or editors. Your work is properly formatted and proofread; your cover letter or query letter has all the right elements (and none of the wrong ones); and your submission packets are professional and polished. Embrace rejection. Whether your piece wasn\u2019t right for the journal or the writing wasn\u2019t strong enough, rejection letters are never personal. Look at them as a badge of honor\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019re out there, you\u2019re trying, and you have the letters to prove it! Play the numbers game. There are thousands of literary magazines out there. Thousands! If you give up after submitting to a dozen or so, think of all the missed opportunities. Making submissions truly is a numbers game, so if you\u2019re submitting strong work to the right places, don\u2019t give up until you find the right home for your work. Keep detailed records. An organized submission strategy involves knowing exactly what work you\u2019ve sent where and when. If an agent or editor asks that you \u201ctry again,\u201d you\u2019ll know what to send and to whom. Stay positive and professional. Believe it or not, some writers respond to rejection slips with immature retorts like \u201cWho wants to be published in your stupid magazine anyway?!\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aand agents and editors take note. Successful writers don\u2019t let their egos get in the way of getting published. And they don\u2019t let minor roadblocks stop their forward progress. Does This Sound Like You? If so, congratulations! You\u2019ve got a healthy submission strategy and the mindset to go the distance By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

Dr. David Caldicott, who was leading the shift as admitting officer, immediately noticed a tense quality in the ambulance driver\u2019s voice. His tone was higher-pitched than normal, and his words came fast and clipped. Two young men had been found unconscious in the grounds of the local university, the ambulance driver said. They would both require immediate tracheal intubation. That was it: the line closed. No further information. The ambulance raced through the city traffic towards the hospital, sirens wailing. \u201cEmergency medicine is like flying a plane,\u201d says Caldicott. \u201cHours of mundanity punctuated by moments of sheer terror. If you\u2019re worth your salt, you\u2019re not scared, though. Just focused.\u201d The men arrived, deeply unconscious and in need of immediate intensive care. Neither patient could breathe properly without assistance, and the ER teams scrambled to stabilize them by splinting open their airways and ventilating their lungs with breathing tubes. What had happened to the men? They were inert and unresponsive as if they had overdosed on heroin, but they had no injection marks and their pupils were not constricted. Still, they were injected with Naloxone, a safe and rapid heroin antidote. It didn\u2019t do a thing. Tests showed none of the standard drugs in the men\u2019s systems. There was no evidence to suggest they had suffered heart attacks or strokes. They had no names, no ages. Nurses draped the men, who were cold, in a pair of warming blankets. All investigations were drawing a blank. Through the confusion, Caldicott\u2019s instincts told him that he had seen this before, three years previously, on the other side of the world. He had treated an overdose of something called methoxetamine or MXE\u2014a designer drug based on the common tranquilizer ketamine\u2014in the small market town of Abergavenny, South Wales, in 2010. \u201cThe guy had faceplanted in a quantity of white powder,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was everywhere, all over his face. Like Scarface. The patient was out of it, but very happy. But once again, it didn\u2019t seem to be something typical, like cocaine. So we sorted him out and sent a sample to the labs to work out, and they found it was MXE.\u201d Caldicott couldn\u2019t quite believe it might be the same rare drug he\u2019d seen 10,000 miles away. Nor could his colleagues. \u201cThey looked at me as if to say, \u2018Who is this crazy man? What are you talking about?\u2019\u201d IN 2011, CALDICOTT HELPED FOUND WEDINOS, a Welsh-government-funded group that identifies and investigates new psychoactive substances. In the years before, there had been a sharp increase in the number of cases in which patients arrived at emergency departments requiring help for drug overdoses, but clinicians\u2014and often even the patients themselves\u2014were unsure what they had taken. After moving to Australia in 2012, Caldicott set up a similar project, called ACTINOS. But when the tests came back, Caldicott\u2019s hunch was right. The men were treated by putting them into a chemically induced coma, which gave them time to purge the drug from their system. It was a lucky escape: MXE overdoses have been linked to at least two deaths. \u201cWe are tracking the arrival of new species as they arrive in a society,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s toxico-surveillance.\u201d Methoxetamine is just one of the novel drugs identified by these groups. It has existed for just over three years, and while it remains legal in much of Europe, and in many other countries in the world, it was made illegal in the UK in 2012. It is closely chemically related to ketamine, but several times more potent. Many of its effects are the same: extreme dissociation, hallucinations, and a semi-paralyzed overdose. And above all, in nearly every country on earth, it is entirely legal to buy. MXE is part of a cultural shift that started a generation ago, but has taken on a new edge in the last few years. In 2008, the first in a wave of new, legal, synthetic drugs emerged into the mainstream. They had little to no history of human use. Instead, they were concocted in labs by tweaking a few atoms here and there\u2014creating novel, and therefore legal, substances. Sold mainly online, these designer drugs cover every category of intoxication imaginable, and their effects resemble the full range of banned drugs, from the mellowness of marijuana to the extremes of cocaine and LSD. They are known as \u201clegal highs,\u201d and they have exploded in popularity: the 2012 Global Drugs Survey found that one in twelve people it surveyed worldwide takes them. Legislators around the world have been put off-balance by the emergence of this massively distributed, technically complex and chemically sophisticated trade. And the trade is growing rapidly. In 2009 The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction\u2019s early warning system identified 24 new drugs. In 2010, it identified 41. In 2011, another 49, and in 2012, there were 73 more. By October 2013, a further 56 new compounds had already been identified\u2014a total of 243 new compounds in just four years. In its latest World Drug Report, the United Nations acknowledged this extraordinary expansion: \u201cWhile new harmful substances have been emerging with unfailing regularity on the drug scene,\u201d it said, \u201cthe international drug control system is floundering, for the first time, under the speed and creativity of the phenomenon.\u201d Technology and drugs have always existed in an easy symbiosis: the first thing ever bought and sold across the Internet was a bag of marijuana. In 1971 or 1972, students at Stanford University\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory used ARPANET\u2014the earliest iteration of the Internet\u2014to arrange a marijuana deal with their counterparts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That groundbreaking deal connected two teams of people who were separated by a 45-hour drive east-west across the entire continent. Today, buying drugs online is far easier and faster\u2014and in many cases, you don\u2019t even have to break the law. Caldicott, speaking from his office in Canberra, says we are living through tumultuous times. \u201cI compare the phenomenon of illicit drug use to influenza. During the course of a year influenza changes slightly, which is why you get a new jab every year. But every 10 to 15 years we see a major shift. The year-to-year swaying and back-and-forth of influenza is called antigenic drift: the world and the bug interacting. When avian or pig flu or something like that appears, that\u2019s called an antigenic shift. When these big changes occur, our immune response is negligible. We can\u2019t fight it. And then we need completely new vaccines.\u201d He continued: \u201cI would argue that we have seen an antigenic shift in the drugs market with the emergence of legal highs since 2008. But the truly extraordinary thing about this is that it\u2019s not just the products that are new. We have all this supplementary stuff: the change in delivery and payment and information and communication systems. All of them have exponentially increased the hazard. It is one of the biggest shifts we have ever seen in the drugs world, to my mind.\u201d THERE\u2019S A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE BEATLES that most people, even some of the band\u2019s most dedicated fans, have not seen. Shot in Hamburg in 1962, it shows each of the band looking slightly manic\u2014but not in the irreverent, comic style that endeared them to the world when they first burst out of the backstreets of Liverpool and on to the global stage. In the photograph, which their manager Brian Epstein kept buried for years, the Beatles appear to be very, very high. John Lennon\u2019s eyes are popping out of their sockets, eyebrows almost reaching his hairline, his teeth locked into a fierce grin. Paul McCartney looks a little better, though his gurning face is matched in desperation only by his clutching hands, which are reaching for the small metal tubes held by Lennon. The tubes contained Preludin tablets, also known as Prellies: diet pills bought to keep the band awake during grueling, multiple sets at the Star-Club on the Reeperbahn in Hamburg\u2019s tough dock district. The active ingredient in Prellies is phenmetrazine, a stimulant drug that is now illegal all over the world. It was patented in 1952 by German pharmaceutical firm Boehringer Ingelheim and came to market in 1956, but was banned internationally fifteen years later. Phenmetrazine was incredibly popular in its day, taken, biographers claim, by John F. Kennedy, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Tennessee Williams, Truman Capote, and Marilyn Monroe, among others. It was sold all over the U.S. and Europe in the 1960s, as an anorectic\u2014a diet aid, since it controls appetite. It also produces a euphoric rush by hitting the brain\u2019s dopamine pleasure and reward centers, just as good food with friends, a gambling win, and sex do. But phenmetrazine\u2014like cocaine, amphetamines and other stimulants\u2014hits those pleasure centers harder and longer. Phenmetrazine was no different from most of the synthetics used in the 1960s: legitimate prescription drugs that were diverted into the hands of users looking for a kick. But with the consumption of drugs so prevalent following the 1960s psychedelic and countercultural explosion, the authorities felt the need to act. The UN conventions of 1961 and 1971 were designed to prevent addiction and long-term health problems. The new laws laid out which substances were banned, but did not prohibit substances that were chemically similar, but not precisely the same. The conventions have hundreds of signatories, and many of these countries have their own additional laws, producing a legal patchwork whereby certain chemicals and modifications are banned in one country, but remain legal in another. Designer drugs are officially known as \u201ccontrolled substance analogs\u201d. (An analog of a drug, in this definition, is a version of a banned compound that has been created with the aim of making it legal.) The UK and U.S. are the market leaders in consumption and marketing of these new substances, which means the two key pieces of legislation that govern\u2014or fail to govern\u2014contemporary drug culture are Britain\u2019s Misuse of Drugs Act of 1971, and America\u2019s Controlled Substance Analog Enforcement Act of 1986. U.S. law states that anything that is \u201csubstantially\u201d similar in its chemical composition to a banned drug \u201cshall, to the extent intended for human consumption, be treated\u2026 as a controlled substance.\u201d However, this blunt phrasing, in an area as complex as organic chemistry, turned out to be legally and socially myopic. Many online designer drug dealers in America simply say the products are not for human consumption: a convenient lie that usually allows them to evade the authorities, but is easily, and willingly, ignored. Most of the innovation around legal highs in recent years has come out of the UK. With the law now over 40 years old, it has hundreds of amendments employed to try and catch an ever-growing list of narcotics. There are currently more than 150 in its most heavily controlled category alone. The law is now caught in a race with runners half its age, who understand chemistry and technology as well or better than the people who wrote the statutes and implement them, and whose aim is specifically to outrun and outsmart the law in order to enrich themselves. Many of those who design drugs do so merely to push the boundaries: these \u201cpsychonauts\u201d as they are sometimes known, are early adopters of new drugs. Some share their knowledge freely and collaboratively; some are intensely geeky; some are pretentious and elitist chemical grandstanders, eager to be the first to try and document any new drug. Many psychonauts are extremely cautious, and fastidious in dosing and documenting a drug\u2019s effects. Others still are reckless risk-takers\u2014people who will try anything for a kick. One user I spoke to enjoyed his experiences with mushrooms so much that he began to seek out all the new hallucinogens he could find. He is a passionate advocate for psychedelics: \u201cIn life, you\u2019re battling through the undergrowth and every so often it\u2019s good to climb a tall tree to get your bearings. This is what psychedelics do for me.\u201d One of the most influential underground chemists is a British man known to me as Karl. In 2010, Karl conceived the recipe for methoxetamine, the drug that David Caldicott spotted in Wales and Australia. I met him first on a bulletin board five years ago, then in person recently. His design for MXE was more potent than its parent, ketamine, which is generally used as an anesthetic but is prized by users for its ability to deliver an out-of-body experience. A legal highs firm took Karl\u2019s design, and had it synthesized by a legitimate Hong Kong lab. It went on sale first in Britain in 2010, before spreading across the world. The drug is now illegal in the UK. Karl is far from alone. David Caldicott has met many of the web underworld\u2019s chemical designers in an attempt to understand what it is that he is seeing. \u201cI was led to meet one once and I had to wear a blindfold,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are hugely secretive people.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a misguided assumption that the guys running clandestine chemistry labs have bad complexions and wear plaid shirts and that they are slightly dim and just follow cookbook recipes. That\u2019s a mistake. These guys are incredibly bright. They are head-and-shoulders\u2014intellectually, certainly\u2014above some of the politicians who are attempting to legislate against them.\u201d IN THE WINTER OF 1944, the USS Pope, a 1,200-ton destroyer escort, was about 1,000 miles from the coast of England. It had recently finished a running battle with German U-boats off the Azores, one of the critical naval conflicts of the Second World War. On board, a young U.S. marine named Alexander Shulgin tried to relax by playing poker, but as he shuffled the cards, his left thumb ached intensely. It was badly infected and needed surgery, but there was no way to operate while at sea. Shulgin\u2019s ship docked at Liverpool, and he was transferred to a nearby army hospital for the operation. There, a nurse handed him a glass of orange juice, and as he drank he noticed a few undissolved grains of powder at the bottom of the glass. He assumed they were the remains of a sedative, and despite his best efforts to stay awake, he fell deeply unconscious. When he awoke, Shulgin discovered he was wrong: the glass had contained only juice and sugar, and his collapse was caused entirely by the placebo effect. It was only after he\u2019d already passed out that the doctors had administered an anesthetic and conducted the operation. The idea that his brain had fooled him was a revelation to the young marine: if a placebo could have such a dramatic effect, the possibilities for active drugs seemed boundless. Suddenly fascinated by the interface between the mind and molecular matter, Shulgin returned to the U.S. and embarked on a career in psychopharmacology. It was an odyssey that would change the lives of millions. From the late 1960s into the 1990s, Shulgin, a tall, loping, grinning man given to gaudy shirts and untamed hair, invented an extraordinary range of drugs. Convinced of the positive benefits of cognitive enhancers, Shulgin worked as an expert chemist for drug manufacturers and the U.S. government, and used his work to subsidize an extraordinary investigation into new psychedelic drugs. Many of them had effects that had never been seen before and often remain little-understood, even now. Shulgin\u2019s discoveries included drugs like DiPT, an analog of a psychedelic chemical found in some plants and fungi, that was manipulated to produce one curious effect: it makes anyone listening to music hear the sounds an octave or so lower than before. Another drug, MMDA, gave users intricate \u201cbrain movies\u201d\u2014extraordinarily bizarre and incredibly detailed narratives that seemed to spring from untapped parts of users\u2019 minds. Shulgin\u2019s breakthrough came with MDMA. Today, known as ecstasy, E, or X, it is now one of the world\u2019s most popular recreational drugs\u2014but it has a complex history. It was first synthesized by German pharmaceutical firm, Merck, in 1912, to get around a patent on a common clotting agent, and later used by the US military in experiments in mind control. But it wasn\u2019t until Shulgin got a tip-off from a fellow researcher in 1965 that he started to investigate the drug. By the 1970s he was hailing it as a breakthrough and circulating it to his friends and family, and in 1978 published a research paper with his colleague David Nichols that explained the drug\u2019s psychotropic nature. Popular for its euphoric, intimate effects, MDMA found its way into the gay club scene in Texas, and from there, by the mid-1980s, to hangouts such as Dallas\u2019s Starck Club, where celebrities like Stevie Nicks and Grace Jones gave it a glamorous sheen. By 1988 the drug had moved to Europe: Ibiza, Manchester, London and beyond, where it gained a soundtrack: acid house. The rave scene\u2019s fascination with ecstasy and illegal warehouse parties echoed the LSD boom of the 1960s, and by the time the first wave of ecstasy use had subsided in the 1990s, Europe\u2019s psychic shoreline had changed. And the liberation offered by this new generation of psychedelics and music was soon augmented by the birth of another lawless free zone: the Web. THE DESIGNER DRUGS SCENE first hit the Internet around 1998, when clandestine chemists started creating small batches of chemicals for their friends and discussing them on sites such as Erowid and forums such as Bluelight. It was a tiny movement, with perhaps a few thousand people worldwide interested in these potent and unusual substances. But circumstances were coming together in a way that nobody could have predicted. Shulgin had meticulously recorded the synthesis and impact of each of his drugs in a pair of strange manuals, PiHKAL and TiHKAL (the first exploring \u201cPhenethylamines I Have Known And Loved\u201d, the second dedicated to tryptamines). Published in the 1990s, each of them combines dry academic passages with flights of fanciful description documenting the drugs\u2019 effects. At the same time, Shulgin\u2019s frequent collaborator, David Nichols, was becoming similarly renowned for his prolific research on mapping the brain\u2019s serotonin and dopamine receptors. And although Nichols, who worked at Purdue University in Indiana for 38 years until his retirement in 2012, partly focused on discovering new treatments for schizophrenia, depression, and Parkinson\u2019s disease, he also explored how these substances worked in the brain: precisely the same psychotropic territory as Shulgin. Until the 1990s, their work had been known only to a small cadre of scientists and psychonauts, but the Internet allowed knowledge previously locked away in books and journals to be shared widely and easily. The studies and research papers of Shulgin, Nichols and others suddenly became instruction manuals, discussed and dissected online by Karl and other chemists. They turned the scientists\u2019 work into mass-produced club drugs. Within a couple of years, dozens of these substances had been cleverly rebranded as \u201cresearch chemicals\u201d and were being\u2014entirely legally\u2014sold over the Web by the underground pharmacists and their entrepreneurial associates. Users sampled the drugs, much as Shulgin had, and documented their experiences online; millions of pages of discussion about their use and effects were created. Then, at the start of the 2000s, the scene hit its first major problem. In a series of separate but highly publicized incidents, three young American men overdosed on a compound named 2C-T-7 that had first been detailed in Shulgin\u2019s books. The resulting backlash against legal highs was then compounded by high-profile busts by the Drug Enforcement Agency. Although few of the people arrested in these raids were actually involved in the manufacture and distribution of the drugs\u2014most were simply customers of the websites that sold these strange new compounds\u2014it did succeed in sending users and dealers into a kind of hibernation. But what law enforcement and everybody else had failed to understand was that the drug market was not going away. It was atomizing and virtualizing. A new market\u2014smaller, more agile\u2014was forming. It took the recipe that had already been developed for research chemicals and added a new element: globalization. JOHN BUCKLEY WALKS THROUGH a North London street, in his pocket a small key. A photographer\u2019s satchel over his shoulder contains a series of identity documents and a printout of a lengthy email correspondence. He hopes he won\u2019t need the papers, but it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry. The streets are busy enough to provide perfect urban anonymity, but even so, Buckley feels watched\u2014followed, even. A year has passed since he last smoked a cigarette, but anxiety triggers the old familiar tug on his receptors; nicotine would smooth this tension out like a steam iron on a shirt cuff. Deep breaths instead. He turns, without breaking stride, through the glass door into the mailbox shop where, a few weeks before, he\u2019d lied barefaced to the staff as he set up a bogus mailing address for a company that does not exist. Buckley recognizes none of the workers today. He walks straight to the wall of corporate-gray mailboxes and opens number 203 with a fluid turn of the key. He expects a package that contains the products of weeks of meticulous planning and molecular-level precision. Instead, it\u2019s empty. One worker, a rangy guy with a Brazilian accent in a checked shirt with an asymmetrical east London fringe, sees his confusion and comes over, helpful, and gestures him to a back room, where there\u2019s a wire cage filled with letters and boxes. They search together through perhaps 50 different packages looking for Buckley\u2019s name, the colors of the courier, anything. It\u2019s several minutes until Buckley spots his name on a large plastic envelope. The Brazilian passes it to him; there are Chinese characters on it, and inside he can feel a small, square box. But he can\u2019t open and check it, not here, so he walks out of the shop and jumps in a black cab home. Safely indoors, I shed the persona of \u201cJohn Buckley\u201d, put my journalist\u2019s press card, passport and paper trail back in its drawer, and tear open the envelope in haste. Inside the box lies a vacuum-sealed metallized bag, and inside that, a pair of small pinch-seal baggies. One of them contains a few grams of white powder. It could be absolutely anything, one of several million compounds of different potencies and effects and toxicities. Or it could be sugar. There\u2019s only one way to find out for sure. MY JOURNEY, FROM MIKE POWER TO JOHN BUCKLEY, from investigative journalist to drug designer, started six weeks earlier. To understand exactly how access to designer drugs has changed\u2014to see exactly how easy it is to commission, purchase and import powerful new compounds that are beyond the reach of the law\u2014I decided to get one made myself. I chose to focus on the Beatles\u2019 drug, phenmetrazine: a nod to the cultural significance of Prellies and their illustrious user base. How easy would it be to get a legal version made? What procedures would it take, what roadblocks would be put in the way? I phoned a contact with expertise in chemistry and asked if he could think of a simple molecular tweak that would produce a new version of phenmetrazine that would be totally legal. Yes, he said. The change would be trivial. What might its effects be? \u201cA fantastic anorectic if you want to lose weight, and an effective stimulant.\u201d The search began for a laboratory that would make a one-off sample. I decided that I would present myself as a legitimate broker for a UK-based pharmaceutical firm. Taking on my new identity, I posted a buying request for the drug on various public websites that broker deals between individuals and small pharmaceutical manufacturers. Dozens of emails came back. Not all of them were genuine. Some of these early responders were blatant scammers: Cameroon and Ukraine do have chemical industries, but those who work in them tend not to be able to offer large amounts of totally new, extremely rare drugs the very next day. My search headed to India, where three firms offered to synthesize the drug for me. On closer examination, though, none of them seemed up to the task\u2014and they were all asking for very large sums of money, well beyond the actual value and difficulty of the compounds we were requesting. One priced the job as high as $10,000. After weeks of constant searching for a decent lab, one of my contacts sent me the URL of a site in Shanghai that, on the surface of things, has nothing to do with legal highs, analog drugs, or any gray-market activity. They sell organic chemicals on international markets to people in many industries, and offer pharmaceutical drugs to legitimate importers. But insiders in China who prefer to remain anonymous say there is little accountability or oversight of the chemical industry there. Once they are licensed, operators are seldom monitored, a scenario that has led to dozens of high-profile public health scares, including 300,000 children falling sick as a result of melamine being added to milk, and so-called \u201cdate rape\u201d drugs appearing in Australian children\u2019s toys. I made an approach to the lab during Chinese business hours, and I heard back within an hour. \u201cFirst, can I know the application of this compound your client use?\u201d asked the person on the other end. \u201cI just want to make sure it is legal application. We can do custom synthesis of this simple chemical surely. But if you can give synthesis route, it will be very good for us and we can save some time for this project.\u201d I replied, \u201cWe are doing basic animal research into the compound\u2019s putative analgesic properties. Based upon its expected effect on monoamines, we believe it will have fairly potent analgesic effects, whilst causing minimal cardiovascular strain. Our intention is to use it as a proof of concept for a new type of analgesic for dogs.\u201d My online identity for this character and for his company are bare bones: nothing but a webmail address. My cover explanation is that I am designing a painkiller\u2014yet phenmetrazine, the clear progenitor of this recipe, is not known to have any analgesic qualities. To anyone who cares to look, my story is blatantly false. But the lab does not seem to care. We agree on a price and discuss quality control standards. The lab eventually agrees to send over data that will, they say, confirm they have created a drug with the makeup I require. The report will be based on high-pressure liquid chromatography, which chemists use to match a sample to library of known compounds, and nuclear magnetic resonance, which can reveal the structure of a molecule, regardless of whether it has been studied previously. Next we agree payment\u2014a few hundred dollars. Rather than an untraceable cash transfer such as Western Union, or an anonymous crypto currency such as Bitcoin, we opt for a simple bank transfer. Delivery is agreed by a well-known courier firm. Two weeks later I receive another email. The compound is ready, though it is currently a liquid. Purity stands at around 93.7 percent; to purify it to 98 percent will reduce yield. I\u2019m happy to accept that loss, as it will never be consumed. I request that it be salted into a solid, powder form using hydrochloric acid. I receive the qualitative data from the firm by email. The NMR readings feature the long, jagged peaks that suggest the existence of the drug. Now that it meets the stringent purity demands of \u201cmy client,\u201d I agree: it\u2019s time to ship it. But how? Technically, we are doing nothing illegal, so we needn\u2019t smuggle it, or even disguise it. At this stage, though, I have no guarantee beyond the lab\u2019s word that they have carried out the work as instructed; they could easily send me an illegal drug instead of the one I have asked for. And while the point of this substance is that it is legal to bring it into the UK, this is not a mainstream importing job. I cannot help feeling the paranoia of a novice: what screening do customs officers and law enforcement do to track unidentified substances that are being sent across their borders? I ask for an Material Safety Data sheet, standard paperwork that should accompany any chemical sample in the post. They do not have one\u2014unsurprising, since the chemical is so rare. The unspoken truth hangs in the complicit silence between us: we both know this a modification of an illegal drug, and that it is designed for recreational, not medical purposes. To get around this, the lab offers to send it hidden in a book: an unusual offer from a company claiming to make and distribute entirely legal substances. But I know that one of the most common ways that small-scale smugglers are detected is when a drug is packed inside an object too cheap or trivial to be posted internationally. Who aside from a rare books dealer would spend $100 sending a book from China to London? Instead, I tell the chemist to simply mark it as documents, to be delivered to a London postal dropbox that I have set up in the fictitious company\u2019s name. Over the next few days I scan the courier\u2019s site nervously watching the package\u2019s progress from Shanghai and out of the country. Paranoia affects would-be drug designers and importers as much as users: after all, while they usually operate legally, their cat-and-mouse game happens at the fringes of the law, not the center\u2014labeling them as not for human consumption\u2014for example. But a few days later my package arrives in the UK, ready for collection. A legal highs vendor would now offer the drug privately to a select number of influential bulletin-board posters, and ask them to review the drug online. Building hype, creating a market, they would then start selling the compound, but the process of testing and legislating means the British government would be powerless to intervene for at least a few months\u2014perhaps even up to a year. They could sell this drug for $130 a gram, or, to make more money, press it into tablets. Instead, I send it by registered mail to Andrew Westwell, a medicinal chemist at Cardiff University, who will analyze its contents. WESTWELL, WHO DESIGNS, synthesizes, and analyzes new drugs for the treatment of breast cancer, is also a member of the WEDINOS group that tracks and traces new recreational drugs in Wales. \u201cLooks like you have a sample of high purity,\u201d he says, after analyzing my mystery drug. \u201cWhoever you were dealing with in China have clearly done a professional job. The synthesis and production is not a trivial task, and requires someone with substantial expertise in synthetic organic chemistry. They also likely have access to good database facilities that will help them design a chemical literature\u2013based synthesis for similar-looking chemicals.\u201d He attaches a copy of his lab\u2019s results: they match, millimeter for millimeter, peak for peak, the version sent by the Chinese lab\u2014showing that the original chemists had access to expensive nuclear magnetic resonance equipment that is normally reserved for pharmaceutical firms or academic research labs. So they succeeded in delivering a legal analog of an illegal drug. But such a substance, ordered over email by a random name with nothing more than a Gmail account and a postal address, seems clearly intended to get people high, rather than form any part of legitimate research. So what does the lab have to say for itself? What do they do to ensure that their customers are legitimate, or that the recipes they cook up are above board? The answer, it seems, is very little. I contact the lab to reveal that I am a journalist. At first they misunderstand what I tell them, and think we are accusing them of producing an entirely illegal substance. \u201cWe didn\u2019t check the job carefully,\u201d admits the manager by email. \u201cFrom now on we will check if the new molecular is legal before we reply to customer.\u201d But what about the identity of the buyer? What level of screening do they run before making a drug? \u201cWe can\u2019t check,\u201d he claims. Many legitimate buyers will use private email addresses, or have business details that his company cannot confirm from overseas. It doesn\u2019t make sense for them to check the credentials of paying customers. So what about the offer to smuggle the sample to us? If the drug he was making was entirely legal, why did he offer to ship it hidden inside a book? He claims it was merely a service offered to avoid unnecessary hassle at customs\u2014a helping hand to genuine pharmaceutical companies, who may want to get an edge over their competitors. \u201cIf our customer requires a sample in a hurry, we can understand their position but you can\u2019t,\u201d he writes. \u201cTime is very precious\u00a0\u2026 If other company finish effect test and apply patent before your company, all the work you have done will become zero.\u201d Yet he has already admitted that did not run enough checks to know whether the substance was legal or not. This is, he suggests, because chemistry is \u201ca very varied subject.\u201d So if the professional chemist can\u2019t\u2014or won\u2019t\u2014tell me whether he really knows what it is he\u2019s making, can Westwell at least tell me what effect the drug might have? \u201cIt is notoriously difficult to predict how a drug structure modification will affect potency, activity, or toxicology. If we could make these types of predictions with any degree of certainty, fiendishly difficult areas like drug discovery and drug development would become so much more straightforward,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, this is a simple modification to a substance with a fairly well-documented history\u2026 it would be reasonable to extrapolate\u2014with a hefty dose of caution\u2014that the psychoactive properties of phenmetrazine would be preserved in this new substance.\u201d What he doesn\u2019t know, of course\u2014what nobody really knows about any research chemical\u2014is what the long-term implications of taking our drug would be. BECAUSE THE LEGAL SYSTEM HAS no way to cope with the constant evolution of research chemicals, the biggest dangers for users aren\u2019t capture and punishment. Instead, many experts fear that even the slightest chemical modification can cause unexpected and undesirable effects. Consider a substance like thalidomide, the entirely legal anti-morning sickness drug prescribed in the 1950s and 1960s, mainly around Europe. Many thousands of women were given the drug during pregnancy and around 10,000 of them gave birth to children with stunted limbs or without limbs at all. This was because the drug\u2019s developers had not isolated and tested it adequately: one version is a relatively safe sedative and nausea treatment, but the other causes serious birth defects. Now, precisely because of scandals like thalidomide, legitimate drugs now have to undergo a battery of tests and study before they become available to the public. But legal highs are rarely tested at all. John Ramsey is a clinical toxicologist who has for over a decade specialized in novel psychoactive substances at St. George\u2019s Hospital in London. Ramsey buys drugs online and tests them and identifies them for police and health services across the UK, and has become Britain\u2019s foremost expert in the identification of new drugs, with a collection of over 29,000 samples. He fears the emergence of a truly toxic chemical: a gray-market equivalent of thalidomide, bought for the high and used widely\u2014but dangerous in ways that cannot be foreseen. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible preemptively to ban them all,\u201d he says. \u201cWe find them, test them and the government drafts laws guessing at all the possible generic variations that can be made. Then the manufacturers just change the formula again. There are simply too many, and too many variations.\u201d The potential dangers of untested synthetics are not theoretical. In June 2012, Elijah Stai, a 17-year-old from Park Rapids, Minnesota, took several packets of an unidentified white powder from a friend, mixed them into melted chocolate, and ate the result. No dose was measured. The powder was 25i-NBOME, a psychedelic originally created to help trace the biochemical pathways that may play a role schizophrenia and depression. But, after being carefully documented in papers by David Nichols, it had been copied and sold online as a legal high. A single gram of 25i-NBOME contains up to 10,000 doses; it is as potent as a chemical weapon in the wrong hands. Stai overdosed, convulsed and battered his head on the floor. He died the following morning. He was the second victim in a week; the other was 18-year-old Christian Bjerk, who lived 150 miles away in Grand Forks. His friend Wesley Sweeney, who had gotten the drug from the same place as Stai, laid it out like lines of cocaine on a table at a party. A typical line of a powdered drug might contain around one hundred milligrams\u2014for Bjerk, that was enough for a thousand-fold overdose. He died quickly in the street. Sweeney was found naked and incoherent in a park: once he recovered, he was tried and jailed for twelve and a half years for supplying the drugs that killed his friend, even though they were ostensibly legal. The drugs had been purchased from a website run by 28-year-old Charles Carlton, who lived over 1,400 miles away in Katy, Texas. Carlton had never met his customers, of whom he had thousands, and his website, MotionResearchCo, was meticulous in enforcing the strictures of the U.S. Analog Act: these chemicals, it said, were not for human consumption. Carlton bought his 25i-NBOME from a Chinese lab. Carlton also imported chemicals from China, the UK, Austria, Poland, Greece, Spain, and Canada: he was charged with conspiracy to import a misbranded drug and faces possible life imprisonment. Dr. Adam Winstock, an addictions psychiatrist in London, suggests that wider society is not ready for the greater availability of novel research chemicals that are coming on sale. \u201cThe Internet parachuted in these new drugs,\u201d he says. \u201cThat meant there was no way for people to accurately discuss correct and safer use around things like dosage and onset of action. Government action and blurring of legislation means we can\u2019t tell people that effectively. It should be on the label.\u201d The men who pioneered so many research chemicals are themselves ambivalent. Alexander Shulgin, now 88, is exhibiting signs of dementia, but has argued in the past that deaths from drugs are a \u201csad event\u201d but that all drugs, from MDMA to aspirin, carry risks if taken incorrectly. Meanwhile, David Nichols, who retired from his role at Purdue\u2019s chemistry department in 2012, says the growth of unregulated, untested legal highs is a deeply negative consequence of drug laws. \u201cIt bothers me,\u201d he admits. \u201cWhen I used to talk about psychedelic research, the one thing you could say was these drugs do not kill people and that they are not addictive. But then when I started seeing people killed by this irresponsible marketing and use, this was not something I intended.\u201d It is clear that others are co-opting his medical research into psychedelics and other potent drugs, and using them in ways he finds uncomfortable\u2014despite the fact that his celebrity status in the drug community means such a response is now predictable. So why did he carry on his research? His answer is surprising. \u201cI have this hidden fantasy that some day, a drug will appear that will have a profound effect on humankind and it will make them stop causing wars and killing each other and gassing each other and destroying society. What if someone came up with a drug that was wildly popular, as popular as ecstasy, but had no side effects, and did not kill? It\u2019s probably an impossible drug. But as a consequence of taking this drug, [people] suddenly realized that all humans are part of one organism, and that when you kill one person you are killing yourself, and that the earth is our lifeboat, and we are destroying it. What if a drug could produce an experience like that? I have fantasized that if it were possible to make a drug like that, I\u2019d sure like to make it in my lab.\u201d David Caldicott is more pessimistic. From a medical and cultural perspective, he says, the constant flood of new drugs is wearying and poses new and unmanageable risks for clinicians and users alike. \u201cWhat is intrinsically dangerous is that there is no gentle build into the market, where in the past when a new drug appeared, we had a chance to gain medical knowledge about it. There are an infinite number of drugs on the market simultaneously, and no sort of body of knowledge. The society that is consuming these drugs has not had time to assimilate them,\u201d he says. \u201cRather than any one of us trying to track the evolution of a single drug, people like me are now faced with this tsunami of different agents.\u201d Certainly, the clinical impact is disturbing. Usually, doctors in emergency care diagnose and treat based on classic symptoms of overdose from different drugs. But now, the indicators they rely on for delivering the right treatment no longer apply. Some drugs on the market create symptoms usually associated with wildly different drug categories. \u201cThe impact of this is that you can be led down the wrong path very quickly,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is one of the problems with the NBOME-series of drugs. You can think patients are presenting with a simple stimulant psychosis, and then suddenly you\u2019re dealing with a case of serotonin syndrome. That\u2019s confusing and dangerous as far as the medical profession is concerned because the assumptions about the drugs we\u2019re treating are probably no longer correct. We have thrown out the textbook. We are forced to wing it with every single drug overdose.\u201d WHILE I WAS CARRYING OUT this investigation, the legal highs industry reinvented itself along exactly the same lines that \u201cJohn Buckley\u201d did. Following a ban on the NBOME series of drugs in the UK, a simple new replacement came to the market: NBOH. It is a set of hallucinogens related to the original work by Nichols, but with a shorter duration and, users say, a more gentle and enjoyable effect. In August 2013, meanwhile, British websites claimed to have bought an entirely new class of drug to the market\u2014one based on LSD. To the Internet drug scene, this is a seismic development. The vendors claim to have synthesized two new LSD analogs, one of which has the same potency as its parent, while the other is even stronger. They are, according to the man who first synthesized them, \u201cas safe as LSD\u201d and one of them, according to someone who tested the product, is \u201ceverything LSD wishes it was, but isn\u2019t.\u201d Initial testing by an independent analyst suggests that at least one of the compounds is exactly what the vendors claim. There is no let-up. In late September, a Shulgin drug called 2CB, lauded by his testers for its aphrodisiac and aesthetic effects, was modified and made available legally at around $65 a gram. So, how easy is it to design and commission a new legal drug based on a banned one? For the most part you cannot simply tweak cocaine, add a molecule and dodge the law\u2014most countries are wise to this, and their rules are tightly-written, expert affairs focused on well-known narcotics. But outside of headline drugs, as I showed, it is simple enough to scan medical literature and look for new compounds that could intoxicate. The resulting drug will, most likely, be legal\u2014though whether the result will be pleasant or not will only be discovered by a process of human trial and error. I passed my drug along to John Ramsey at St. George\u2019s to be logged into TICTAC, a database that is used by law enforcement and healthcare professionals. We do not know precisely what my legal drug will do: It may be incredibly unpleasant\u2014but it will be active and, with the right marketing, could potentially sell by the truckload. And here lies the problem. We can ban drugs. But we can\u2019t ban chemistry, and we can\u2019t ban medical research. There are an almost infinite number of different drugs and substitutions that are possible, and a combination of circumstances have radically increased the public\u2019s ability to access and alter them. The openness of the Web, China\u2019s prominence as both a manufacturer and exporter, the ability of laypeople to study organic chemistry, the availability of research, improved technology and falling prices\u2014these have all come together to create an unusual, explosive, effect. I am a rank amateur by comparison to my contacts in the chemical underworld, who dedicate their lives to creating these novel psychoactive substances. And just 20 years ago, this experiment would have been impossible for anyone except a skilled chemist. Yet I was able to complete it in a matter of weeks. David Caldicott laughed as we discussed the ramifications of the deal I made as \u201cJohn Buckley.\u201d \u201cThis is concierge drug design, outsourcing all the risk and hard work. It\u2019s like room service drug design, ordering from a menu.\u201d What can we do about it? The drugs and the technology and the culture have all mutated to take advantage of their environment, but our policies have remained static for many decades. Instead of constricting supply, drug laws focused on a group of well-known chemicals have simply pushed users towards new and increasingly dangerous forms of chemical stimulation. And now attempts to enforce the law simply encourage greater, riskier innovation\u2014and no one now knows where that will take us. Caldicott offers an analogy: \u201cLet\u2019s see drugs as an illness, and prohibition as an antibiotic. If you treated any illness with the same antibiotic for 50 years, medical people would be stunned if resistance hadn\u2019t developed.\u201d This story was written by Mike Power, edited by Bobbie Johnson, fact-checked by Kristen French, and copy-edited by Tim Heffernan.

What did surprise me was how often the bed was the subject, not the object, of the stories they told. It was a sometime friend, a sometime antagonist. It wasn\u2019t just a vessel for sleep; it was a safe harbor, a secret-keeper. For most of us, the bed is where we start our mornings. Whether it\u2019s an oasis of tranquility or a battleground where pets and partners and kids compete for our space, it\u2019s our beginning. It defines us so much that if we\u2019re in a bad mood, someone will say we got out on the wrong side of it. You can\u2019t talk about the morning without beginning with the bed.\u200a\u2014\u200aFrom the Editor, Evyn Williams A ray of light leaks through the blinds and assaults my eyelids. I turn my body, breaking the seal of my warm imprint on the bed. A looming glow invades the room; darkness turns to soft shadows. A low-level crisis begins. The day is about to break free. I scramble. Take hold of my majestic blanket. Envelop myself in it like a warm hug. A leg escapes from under the covers, hoping to find the perfect balance of warmth and coolness. All I want at this moment is to binge watch my dreams and sleep for a thousand years. But then I hear tiny footsteps against the wood floor. Before I can open my eyes, a little hand clasps my face. \u201cDada,\u201d I hear and I scoop up a small body that smells of doughy sweetness. She climbs my body as if it were a jungle gym. She squeezes herself between my wife and me. We both clamber to wrap our arms around her. Make claims on her soft, petite body. But she is a harbinger of the morning. We instantly realize our mistake as she thrashes about, wreaking havoc on the small chance of remaining asleep. I bury my face in my pillow, throw the covers over my head, but I am outnumbered. My four-year-old bounces on the bed like a trapeze artist and my wife declares it a glorious morning. There is no salvation, no sanctuary, no refuge. Just as I think all is lost, a vision is delivered to the center of my puny brain; it arrives like an answer to a prayer, the one thing sweeter than the pillow under my head. Coffee. \u201cWhen are you getting those kids out of your bed?\u201d a friend asks again. I usually say something noncommittal to deflect the conversation. \u201cMaybe when we get Kate a big girl bed.\u201d Or: \u201cI think we\u2019ll work on that over the summer.\u201d I never say anything about how much I love sharing my bed. Not at night when I\u2019m tired and my daughter\u2019s little body squirms and fidgets beside me, and my son kicks and flails, but in the morning. Nothing is sweeter. There is something decadent and sinful in admitting I let them sleep with me because I like waking up with them near. Morning fills the room and there they are, pink cheeked and peaceful in the peach light of dawn. My son has always kicked his way out of blankets and lies diagonally across my husband\u2019s chest. My daughter shares my pillow, a mop of curly hair that mingles with my own so you can hardly tell where mine ends and hers begins. Most mornings, I can\u2019t help but bury my face in my daughter\u2019s curls. I breathe in the sweet scent of her, the complicated perfume that tells my DNA this child is mine. The smell is fading now, but once, when she was new and fresh, the pheromones fired like a cannon blast targeted straight for my center, meant for me and only me, designed by years of evolution to draw me in. She feels me curl around her and turns towards me, nuzzling in like a newborn pup. One hand wraps around my neck, tiny fingers tangling in my hair. Her breath is whisper-soft against my cheek. Her eyelids flutter as she slowly surfaces from wherever she wanders in her dreams. When she finally sheds sleep completely, it will be with a suddenness that is beautiful and baffling. One minute she is snuggled into me and the next she is perched on her knees, rifling through the books on the bedside table. She finds the one she wants and snuggles back into a nest made of blankets, pillows, and me. \u201cRead it, Mommy,\u201d she says. Of course I do. I read it with funny voices and silly words and she giggles beside me, a sound that fills and breaks my heart; it\u2019s a sound too perfect for this world or any other I can imagine. I tell her hush in between our laughter, because Daddy and James are still asleep, cuddled together on the other side of the bed. Even the dog still sleeps, splayed at my feet, taking up more space than she needs, one paw draped over my ankle. They are all still somewhere else, while we are here, relishing in the soft beginning of a new day. It\u2019s in those moments that I think of the people who find some flaw or disfunction in the way we sleep. I think of the friend at work and her pointed questions; I feel bad that she doesn\u2019t know the joy of this. I think of her missing out on all the love and mess and fullness. I think about how lucky I am to have so much, to have all my loves here in one place in the world, together and safe. I think it\u2019s a damn good thing we have a king size bed. She asked for help changing the bedding one morning. That is when the chalked outline of the body on the mattress was first revealed to me. The previous boyfriend. It was a traced reminder. A linear warning. She explained all this in just two words: he cheated. She went back to humming while working the sheets. The chalk outline indicated the body had slept in the same corner of the bed, same fetal position, just aft of the dog. Fuck. \u201cNothing better than clean linen!\u201d She paused for a moment to let the sight sink in before tucking a fitted sheet over the ex. The ex vanished back down into the 300 count crime scene cover-up. She looked up, beaming. \u201cSo, how do you like the bamboo pillows?\u201d I wake up slowly, enjoying the light slanting through my window. My back arches and curls, becoming limber with movement. I\u2019m lost in the feel of sheets against skin. I let myself float in the large house\u2019s silence, only broken by the birds greeting spring. There\u2019s a beautiful sensuality in the mornings. Feel is not right or wrong. It\u2019s just feeling. I lay here, my hair splayed against the pillow. I run my fingers through it, the dark giving it a rusted hue. I should get up and check on the cat I\u2019m here to watch. Instead, I let my thumb rub against my sternum, down my belly. He\u2019s inside and indoors, I remind myself. No need to rush. I stay in bed, trying to hold onto this moment. I make constellations with my freckles. I root myself in the body, in hair and skin and sensory softness. I need a space before society comes crashing in with all its messages of who I\u2019m supposed to be. If I stay in this queen size bed with too many pillows, I have a few more moments with my own radical truth: this body is made to feel and enjoy. Despite thick blinds, the sun gets brighter. I get up slowly, walking to the bathroom. My eyes travel down, enjoying the warm light against my pale skin. My breasts hang a bit, swaying with my motion. At the mirror, my fingers trace the creases along my thighs, the only evidence of my restless night. Once I\u2019m done, I turn back, facing the large bed again. I should get up, do an inspection of the house, bring in the newspaper. But the bed is the right balance of firm and soft. The thick covers are a siren call. I could nestle in, and read a book. For a moment, I\u2019m torn, until I realize my legs are already climbing back into bed. There\u2019s time enough to look for the cat. For now, there are simple pleasures waiting for me between the sheets. In some parts of the world, hard labour is not always paid in terms of monetary value. So, when I spent one summer in the Scottish Highlands helping to dig over a particularly weed infested piece of land (for possible, but not probable, horticultural use), I was offered a bed in return. One that\u2019s handmade, not from driftwood, but proper locally sourced Scottish pine. I had never owned a bed before, mainly due to living in rented properties that already had a frame, or with men who came as a package where the sleeping arrangements were the least of my problems. When the bed arrived, it was in bits and pieces. That doesn\u2019t matter, I thought. I can handle a drill. As I put it together, it seemed to me the frame was a bit short. I worried about my mattress. By the time I\u2019d assembled the screws and fittings, it dawned on me that it was not the length that was the problem\u200a\u2014\u200ait was the width. They had sent me a single bed. Who do they think I am? A teenager in need of extra space for the drum kit or the dirty laundry? A hippie hermit worried that too big a bed would leave no room for the yoga mat? Looking longingly at my double mattress, I questioned where to place my books. In the morning, I would always wake up with a minimum of five books next to me. And what about the laptop? I knew I\u2019d need it close by to play my audio books, without which I could not fall asleep\u200a\u2014\u200amost of them still playing in the morning, telling me reassuringly that once again Elizabeth got her Mister Darcy. And where do I sleep? I always slept on the right side, a position I had ferociously defended against boyfriends, my daughter, and even my sister\u2019s cat. The bed they sent didn\u2019t even have a right side. It didn\u2019t have a left side either. It didn\u2019t have a middle. It was just a piece of empty space. Then, paranoia set in. I remembered the expression, \u201cCan you imagine waking up next to that one?\u201dand ice cold fear gripped me. Had I really got that old and ugly that nobody wanted to wake up next to me? Is that why they\u2019d got me a single bed? I might have had a few more cracks and wrinkles in the morning than I had ten years ago, but who did they suspect I wanted to lie next to? Some twenty-something model? Just where would I have gotten him from? Fear turned into rage. Maybe they thought I was too old to even consider waking up next to anyone. Maybe they assumed, since I came there single, and stayed single, that I was forever meant to remain single. Who are they to decide? There was no way I was going to wake up in a single bed every morning. It would have meant accepting defeat, without a fight (never mind the books and the laptop). I threw the offending frame parts and the screws and all the damn fittings into the back of my car and drove out to return the whole mess, seething about my suspicions. Two weeks later, a new bed arrived. It\u2019s was a double this time. It was beautiful and truly massive. Every piece of the frame had been reinforced, and the wooden slats the mattress was meant to rest on were twice the size of any previous bed I\u2019d slept in. Wow, I thought. Have I put on a lot of weight? Maybe they think that I\u2019m going in the wrong direction, proverbially\u200a\u2014\u200aand literally. Maybe they think \u2013 The man delivering the frame blanched as I demanded to know the meaning of it. \u201cYeah, about that,\u201d he said, his head dipping as he scratched the back of his neck. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to put our feet right into it again, but since you never take anyone home, we didn\u2019t know your preferences and decided to cater for all possibilities. It can carry a four hundred pound man\u200a\u2014\u200aor a couple of two hundred pound men\u200a\u2014\u200aand will most likely survive even the most extravagant shenanigans you could come up with.\u201d Touch\u00e9. I thanked him, and got the drill once again, imagining how my laptop would look next to a full volume of Shakespeare\u2019s Collected Works and an unabridged version of Gray\u2019s Anatomy in the morning. I have a husband who builds furniture. He has an eye for proportion and a true love and understanding of wood. Our cabinetry is cherry of his design, the coffee table thick oak with the butterfly joint, the walnut buffet, the maple full-length mirror. He takes his time in the shop. He hand-planes, delicate lacy curls surrounding him when I pop in with a coffee, Neil Young in the background. And he will build us a bed. No, we cannot buy a bed. For, one day, he will build it. And for 20 years we have had a mattress on the floor. I think I would not know our bed if it was elegantly and sturdily framed. What sharp edges would need negotiation during drunken sexy tumbles? How far to the floor to reach folded over novels and half-finished bottles of San Pellegrino, glasses of red wine? We talk about The Bed That Will Be Made: four-poster, simple lines, hidden drawers. But I love the broad drape of the duvet on all sides now; how quick to mess up, how quick to make up. How accessible and humble. The children jump freely, we make love and argue and wrap Christmas presents, where coats are thrown during parties, for morning spooning and drowsy reaching and toes easily touching floor. I never sweep beneath; indeed, no space for monsters there. Brought to you by the HITRECORD Community, in partnership with Medium. At HITRECORD, everything we make is collaborative.

Search The user can search the options for food with the available traditional variety and price. 3. User profile It will take the social logo and the passport details of the user. Hence, there will be an automatic update to the places they move. 4. Booking The final booking is also as simple as the selection. The confirmation page displays the food selected, payment mode, time of arrival, confirmation and contact details. For attaining the solution, the skeletal framework of the design was done first. After a set of rough trials, I had made the design of every screen. Before designing the real app, we have endured the usage of the app in paperwork. We reflected the design in the paperwork in the mobile screens and perceived the response of the user. We have witnessed multiple remarks from various users.1. Young travelers don\u2019t use this app much as food is not a constraint for them.\u00a02. Some users found it\u2019s tiresome with many screens in the payment flow.3. Need to add the flexible time selection option and sorting option.4. Most of the users preferred the screens in map view than the card view. Analyzing the feedback of the user from the critic round, I have revamped the UI of the design in a single view. There is a lot to learn from Airbnb as the leader of tours and travel. It was only a few years ago the culture of shared home become popular. So I have considered more about the cultural impact of this service. Most my interviewee love in this experience of micro-interaction and the Ubererification of design. Still struggle to find the best business model.

My ability to hold it together was undone during the story\u2019s \u201call is lost\u201d moment as Iris Gaines taught a powerful lesson of redemption not only to her estranged lover Roy Hobbs but to all of us who arrive at midlife feeling as if we\u2019ve wasted some of our best years. Earlier in the story, we see Hobbs as one of the most naturally gifted players ever to grip a baseball. He\u2019s a can\u2019t-miss prospect with a chance to be the GOAT (greatest-of-all-time). Working \u201cGOAT\u201d into an article makes me feel hip. In addition to that, I just took my four small kids to Chick-fil-a in my joggers and Jordan's that I got for my forty-first birthday. Midlife crisis much? Anyway, back to the midlife crisis story that\u2019s actually fictitious. Unfortunately, on his way to breaking in with the Chicago Cubs as an invincible twenty-year-old, tragedy derailed Hobbs\u2019 career before it ever got started. On the train ride to the Windy City, the starry-eyed, young prospect fell for the wrong woman and wound up getting himself shot, of all things. He survived shooting, but his injuries were severe enough to indefinitely postponed his baseball career. What a blow. Predictably, Hobbs didn\u2019t handle his new reality well. Adding shame and self-destructive behavior to the rotten luck of having a tryst with an armed psychopath, Hobbs parlayed an unfortunate life event into a full-blown downward spiral that delayed his major league debut by sixteen years. That\u2019s right, Hobbs\u2019 best years, his youth, was tragically and senselessly laid to waste. But that\u2019s not the worst part of the story. That comes after Hobbs pulls himself up by his bootstraps, gives baseball one more shot, and actually works his way into the major leagues with a bottom-feeder team at the ripe old age of thirty-six. While this was hardly a promising opportunity, Hobbs\u2019 elite talent won out. Against all odds, Hobbs had a rookie season to end all rookie seasons. Despite his advanced age as a player, he took the major leagues by storm. He hit home runs in bunches, led his team to the pennant, and dominated the front page of every newspaper in the country. Roy Hobbs was a hero. A hero to everyone but himself. For in Hobbs\u2019 mind, his dream year was not the redemption story everyone made it out to be. To him, it played more like a tragedy. The way he saw it, his great season was, more than anything, hard evidence of not only how great he could have been, but also how great he would never get the chance to be. He\u2019d shown up late for the party. He\u2019d squandered away his best years. Now, he was out of time. Hobbs\u2019 lament to Iris, the day before his final game is a dead-on example of what midlife regret sounds like. Hobbs: I coulda been better. I coulda broke every record in the book. Iris: And then? Hobbs: And then? And then when I walked down the street people would\u2019ve looked and they would\u2019ve said there goes Roy Hobbs, the best there ever was in this game. During this scene, I nodded to the cadence of Roy\u2019s words because I\u2019ve felt an awful lot like him. As I hit rock bottom professionally, emotionally, and financially during midlife, I reflected upon what a waste my previous years had apparently been. I thought I had so much more to offer in the beginning. After acing his class, my English professor wrote on my final portfolio, \u201cYou\u2019re going to do very well for yourself, Jathan.\u201d In twenty years of nonprofit leadership, people liked me and followed me and looked forward to what I might blossom into someday. I even had glowing compliments from parishioners when I was an up-and-comer at my father\u2019s church. One said, \u201cJathan, I didn\u2019t think you were going to make it as a preacher, but after hearing that sermon you preached Sunday, you\u2019ve just about changed my mind.\u201d Another, being deeply moved by another message I delivered said with great certainty, \u201cJathan, you\u2019re not going to be a peon all your life son.\u201d After having perhaps the worst first year in the history of the teaching profession, my principal told me after my third year, \u201cJathan, I\u2019ve never had a teacher make as vast an improvement as you have.\u201d (Was that a compliment?) You know, as I write this, it\u2019s all starting to all come together. Anyway, back to the point at hand. As a leader, I wasn\u2019t the can\u2019t-miss prospect that Hobbs was, but surely I had enough ability to have done better for myself. As it stood, here I was, approaching forty more broke than I\u2019d ever been, more emotionally bankrupt than I ever thought I could be, and completely without answers as to where I might go from here. On more than one occasion I pondered how much further down the road I\u2019d been had things broken my way, perhaps. A few more dollars invested in the right thing here, a key relationship established there. Then there were my own mistakes to lament. If I\u2019d just been more disciplined, been stronger in my faith, not been so downright bullheaded. Finally, there was the ultimate question, \u201cDid I completely whiff and take the wrong path with life?\u201d This internal Guantanamo Bay routine is what happens to those who arrive at midlife with a case full of participation trophies. Those might make an eight-year-old feel like a world champion, but they make a burned out midlifer feel like he\u2019s been playing the wrong sport all his life. Even if it isn\u2019t true. And eventually, I realized that it wasn\u2019t. So did Roy Hobbs although it took Iris to set him straight. After a long pause by Roy\u2019s hospital bed, she gives him a knowing smile and replies: Iris: You know, I believe we have two lives. Hobbs: How\u2026 what do you mean? Iris: The life we learn with and the life we live with after that. This is the part where I shed a tear. Or two. Three, maybe? Because Iris was right. Roy\u2019s wasted years had not been for nothing and neither had mine. Because of the hard road Roy had taken, he always took more time out for the young fans than the other players. Furthermore, as he blossomed into a star, he never let his meteoric success change who he was. Finally, when he was offered a tempting pile of cash to become corrupt, he turned it down and played the game right down the middle. In other words, what Roy\u2019s suffering stole from him in terms of hero-worship, groupies, and multi-million dollar endorsement deals, it made up for in a deeper soul, richer character, and more benevolent heart. When viewing my first forty years through this lens, I realized that, because of my mistakes, I too, had become a whole lot more than I had accomplished. One might argue that Roy could have easily been just as grounded had he not sabotaged himself and misspent his youth. In which case, he would have had it all\u200a\u2014\u200athe greatest baseball player of all time and a downright nice guy to boot. This very well may be true. Furthermore, I suppose it\u2019s possible that there are those remarkable individuals who take this route all the time. But for every person who never veers from that enviable straight line to significance there are scores more of us who arrive at midlife\u2019s pit stop needing all four tires changed and a complete engine replacement. And for us, we mustn't lament what our mistakes have cost us, but rejoice in what they\u2019ve taught us. Our missteps were not our epitaph; they were our schoolmaster. And now that we\u2019ve learned, it\u2019s time that we must live. Free eBook\u200a\u2014\u200aReBelieve: How To Get Unstuck By Believing the Truth About Yourself.

They were dressed in business-casual and cocktail attire. Fading light from the wraparound windows painted the sparsely furnished room in hues of orange and pink. Sixteen stories below, a row of silver railway cars lined up at the city\u2019s Caltrain station, looking like children\u2019s toys against the backdrop of skyscrapers. Orange-and-black\u2013clad baseball fans streamed from the station and headed to the nearby AT&T Park, but the cocktail party seemed oblivious to the night\u2019s game. In place of sports trivia, their conversations were peppered with organizational affiliations. Google. MIT. Stanford. In the crowded kitchen, a 50-something man in thick, designer glasses recounted a birthday dinner he had thrown for his fianc\u00e9e. \u201cWe must have drunk ten thousand dollars\u2019 worth of wine,\u201d he said. He turned to a nearby guest, an acquaintance who had recently piloted a new type of mobile app, and asked how things were going. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d the guest said. But, he added, someone had recently told him\u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s wrong,\u201d Designer Glasses interrupted loudly. \u201cIt\u2019s a great idea.\u201d He sipped his drink, then looked around for a new conversation to join. To the side of them, on a black marble kitchen island, trays of hors d\u2019oeuvres sat forgotten. A store-bought red velvet cake with a housewarming message piped onto it had only a single slice missing. Around the food, though, the party was a churning network of people. Strangers moved towards each other with a smile and a firm handshake. \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d they asked each other. \u201cAnd how do you know Olivia?\u201d Olivia Fox Cabane, the 34-year-old host, was wearing a low-cut black dress and dark tights. Her feet sparkled with the red sequins that she had added to her otherwise simple flats. She had pulled her curly brown hair into an elegant half-updo, a nice complement to her long, pale face. Her heavy-lidded eyes were rimmed with gold eyeshadow, and they grew wide whenever she spotted an introduction that needed to be made. Software engineers met neuroscientists, entrepreneurs mingled with investors. Email addresses were exchanged, lunches scheduled. And Olivia kept moving. She came into the kitchen. Two young men were now trying to start a party game. \u201cIt\u2019s a game of first impressions,\u201d explained one, a 20-something Stanford graduate with black spiky hair and tight dark-wash denim jeans. \u201cWe all have preconceived ideas about who other people are, but we\u2019re not always right.\u201d The guests nodded. Spiky Hair continued: The idea is that you share your first impression of someone else in the group, he said. And that person has to refute it with a story. \u201cFor example,\u201d he said, pointing at the woman standing across from him, \u201cI might say, \u2018I think you\u2019re really boring and you\u2019ve never done anything interesting in your life.\u2019 And you would say?\u201d \u201cUh,\u201d the woman replied. She looked lost, and a short but distinctly awkward pause followed. Olivia swooped in. \u201cThat reminds me,\u201d she said, lightly touching the startled guest\u2019s arm and pulling her away. \u201cHave you met Laurie? She\u2019s a fabulous girl. Super intimidating. Let me introduce you.\u201d After she seemed sure the new connection was taking root, Olivia began to pull back from the conversation. She slipped away from the group, threading her way through the living room and toward her private office. She closed the door behind her and, now alone, took off her sequined shoes and lowered herself to the floor. She lay supine on the white carpet next to her desk, with its built-in treadmill, and a pile of well-worn Terry Pratchett novels. Olivia Fox Cabane was hiding from her own party. She took a few deep breaths and let the silence wash over her. It wasn\u2019t the first time this evening she\u2019d done so, and it wouldn\u2019t be the last. She was finding it exhausting to be around other people. She needed time to recharge, even if it meant physically closing herself off from everyone for a few minutes. Olivia needed to be charming that night. As is often the case when she is playing host, she had to work hard at it. We\u2019re used to thinking about charisma as an intangible. It\u2019s a quality that is instantly recognizable in its natural form, yet defies definition. Martin Luther King, Jr. had it. Steve Jobs, too. Michelle Obama has it. So does Don Draper. Whether it\u2019s the way someone always remembers your name, seems to care about your life, or notices your new haircut, the draw of charismatic people is almost universal. We don\u2019t just like who they are; we like who we are around them. They make us feel important, and yet we are the ones who end up wanting to please. Popularity and power are the birthright of the naturally charismatic. But Olivia wasn\u2019t born with it. She is, and has always been, an introvert. As a teenager she was a high-school outcast\u2014the kind of kid who sits silently, then says too much, and at the wrong time. She has an engineer\u2019s mind and an occasionally clumsy grasp of social nuance. It took her years to learn how to be a good host, and to do so she had to seek out the science of charisma. She had to assemble tools and tricks that could transform a shy teenager into a socialite. She had to reverse-engineer the intangible. Now she earns a six-figure salary by teaching others how she did it. Olivia\u2019s clients include Fortune 500 CEOs, human resource managers, heirs to international fortunes, and the executive directors of major charitable organizations. Increasingly, they\u2019re also the engineers and tech entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley. After all, hot startups can grow from 5 to 500 employees in a few years, forcing the founders\u2014who are often computer programmers\u2014out of their cubicles and into roles that require them to inspire and emote. What\u2019s more, the teams these founders manage have become diverse: Engineers and designers are valued equally in many startups. The new executive has to get the best out of both. Olivia is very busy. After a few minutes on the floor of her office, Olivia sat up and brushed the carpet fuzz from her dress. Her face was serene, satisfied. When she opened the door to rejoin her guests, she practically floated toward the Stanford kids, whose game had stalled on another confused guest. Olivia reached down to scoop up a small black-and-tan puppy\u2014a foster dog she was watching\u2014that had been wandering around without anyone noticing. She handed the burrito-sized animal to the Stanford duo, who took turns holding it while other guests cooed. The conversation shifted to dog people versus cat people. Olivia smiled at the pair, who seem relieved to be saved from the game they had created. The party rolled on.  OLIVIA WAS BORN in Paris in 1979. Her father was French, and a physical chemist; her mother, an American psychotherapist. Though Olivia spoke French fluently, she was ostracized at school. A picture from Olivia\u2019s pre-teens shows a group of coiffed, Parisian children\u2014a 1990s tableau of perky ponytails, doll-like features, and brightly colored sweaters. The children beam at the camera, glowing with enthusiasm. All except Olivia, whose smile hangs limply. Her round glasses and dark, heavy features jar with her classmates\u2019 airy blondeness. She appears to be surrounded by a cushion of space, as the children around her are repelled toward their other neighbors. Part of the problem, Olivia recalls, was that she didn\u2019t fit into any prescribed social group: She was too athletic for the nerds, too bookish for the jocks. She liked science fiction but also enjoyed dressage. Her mother, sensing that something was amiss, tried to help her daughter fit in by dressing Olivia in an American interpretation of French fashion: frilly, floral outfits ornamented with gloves and bows. The other kids called her a poser. \u201cTo them, I was always the weird American,\u201d Olivia said recently. \u201cIt was obvious to everyone except my mother. Fitting in was something she desperately wanted for me, but all I did was stand out for the wrong reasons.\u201d The awkward child became a dorky teen. The popular girls grew willowy; Olivia developed a curvy, athletic build. Flirting came as second nature to most of her peers, but Olivia was baffled by the subtleties of social interaction. She was too blunt, others told her. Too honest. Too much like her ultra-rational scientist father, who liked to work by \u201cthinking like a molecule\u201d And there was something unusual in her speech patterns, too. The young Olivia would butt into conversations and then become exhausted. She had a tendency to overshare, bursting forth with information like a conversational water balloon. Olivia\u2019s behavior may sound like an indication of Asperger syndrome, a mild form of autism. But there is a crucial difference between an awkward teen and many young people on the autistic spectrum: Olivia was keenly aware of her social rejection. She recognized the disappointment in the face of her mother, who desperately wanted her daughter to fit into French society; she felt the scorn of her classmates; she sensed that she was saying and doing the wrong things, but she couldn\u2019t figure out how to make people like her. Olivia\u2019s worst years came after her parents transferred her from a diverse international school to Lyc\u00e9e Victor Duruy, a small, elite high school in a wealthy district of Paris. The building was blocks from the Eiffel Tower and served some of the oldest families in France. At her new school, she wasn\u2019t just the weird American; she was the weird, lower-class American. According to Olivia, her French teacher even announced to the class that, because of her non-intellectual hobbies like swimming and skiing, the only thing Olivia was fit to become was a garbage collector. Her new classmates were similarly cruel: She learned some had banded together to form a \u201cLet\u2019s get Olivia kicked out of school\u201d club. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a pretty time,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the tools back then to interact with other humans. So I survived by going numb.\u201d Her grades suffered, but she managed to qualify for French law school. At 18, she left and headed to Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne University, where she was one of over 3,000 first-year students. Compared to the intense social scrutiny of Duruy, the relative anonymity felt like a vacation. \u201cI finally got to be just a face in the crowd,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cIt was such a relief not to be in fight-or-flight mode all the time; I was finally able to think. That\u2019s when I started developing the tools.\u201d Olivia had always been a fan of tools. When she was a kid, she would spend hours watching her father at his workbench. The room contained a letterpress and a device for slicing metal, but her father\u2019s favorites were the woodworking tools. Olivia loved the way he could use them to change the nature of materials, altering the shape and feel of an object until it resembled something completely new. She remembers the smell of wood shavings filling her nostrils as he carved patterns into the wood. \u201cThat was always the place I wanted to go play,\u201d she said. The memories came back to her in her first years of university, when the respite from bullying allowed her to reflect on the challenges she\u2019d encountered socially. For most of her life, Olivia had felt lost when navigating social situations, while others seemed to have a built-in compass. She desperately wanted to find her way, but how? Raised by two academics, she looked for answers in behavioral science. \u201cWhen you have parents who are a psychotherapist and a physical chemist, you assume there\u2019s been research done about everything,\u201d Olivia told me recently. \u201cBut academic studies are not presented as tools. They\u2019re presented as complex tables and regressions. So it took a lot of time to get what the studies were saying. Unfortunately in my case, I didn\u2019t have time. I was really desperate. I needed to figure this out for myself,\u201d Olivia\u2019s mother wanted to help, so she handed her daughter a book, Dale Carnegie\u2019s How to Win Friends and Influence People. In place of graphs and tables, the book contained lessons like \u201cThree fundamental techniques in handling people;\u201d \u201cThe six ways to make people like you;\u201d \u201cThe twelve ways to win people to your way of thinking.\u201d \u201cMy mother said she wasn\u2019t sure if it would be useful since, to her, the book was full of no-brainers,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cShe was like, \u2018Geez, do people need to be told this?\u2019 For me, though, it was a revelation.\u201d For the first time, Olivia realized there were actual human tools one could use to interact with others. She began to seek out other titles, and used them to build a social road map. It took some effort. Though self-help books were gaining popularity in the United States at the time, in France they were barely tolerated. Few people bought them, and those that did rarely admitted to it. But Olivia was hooked, and before long she had accumulated a small trove of social self-help books. They weren\u2019t all helpful. Several were outdated personality guides from the 1950s, a time when it was assumed that only the naturally charismatic became leaders. But a few stuck out, like one by Kate White, editor-in-chief at Cosmopolitan between 1998 and 2012, titled Why Good Girls Don\u2019t Get Ahead\u00a0\u2026 But Gutsy Girls Do. White listed \u201cnine secrets every career woman must know\u201d and urged ambitious young women to shed their self-effacing good-girl personas and \u201cget some zip.\u201d Olivia was struck by the methodical techniques that White advocated, including the idea that women should \u201ctoot their own horns\u201d and seek out new challenges. Olivia started experimenting with her own behavior, adding updated tools of her own. She had begun writing a recipe for reinvention. THE IDEA THAT qualities like charisma or leadership can be taught is fairly new. Sixty years ago, science dictated that social skills were innate; somebody like Olivia would have been better off seeking a profession in which she could mostly avoid people. Peter Cappelli is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton business school and an expert on human-resources development. He says that leadership training was first deemed necessary for success in the 1920s, when corporations like General Electric began to hire inexperienced workers straight from university. GE sent new employees on programs designed to fast-track them into tailored positions\u2014some of the first executive-development schemes in the world. As with business-coaching tactics today, the methods were rooted in the latest scientific knowledge. But the psychology of the 1920s was rather different to today\u2019s, in part because of the influence of Freud. Freud believed there were three aspects to our personality and psyche: the id, ego and superego. The ego (conscious mind) and superego (conscience) could be shaped by society, but the id represented our biologically ingrained instincts and motives, from which we could not easily be freed. What\u2019s more, Freud argued that much of our behavior stems directly from the id. To business thinkers, this meant that some people were psychologically predisposed for leadership, while others lacked the necessary hardwiring. Finding a company\u2019s future executives, in other words, was a matter of correctly identifying a person\u2019s knack for leadership. At GE, promising new hires entered a one-year program, during which their leadership potential was assessed by both superiors and peers. The company also ran what would now be called an executive retreat\u2014effectively, a test of employees\u2019 ability to socialize. Lower-level managers and executives would spend a week in the summer camping on a company-owned island in Lake Ontario. One can see the appeal of the approach, or at least appreciate why it made sense at the time. But it imposed an artificial ceiling on those deemed to be lacking social skills. This was bad news for introverts. Over the next few decades, however, businesses like GE began letting each section of the company develop its own leaders. Some executives pushed back against the separation of social and technical skills, and started considering engineers for management roles. Other companies made similar changes. A 1953 study found that one-third of large corporations were led by executives with engineering backgrounds. While this might have been meritocratic, it wasn\u2019t always effective. According to Cappelli, the engineers were \u201cfrequently bewildered\u201d by executive positions, which were fundamentally about overseeing people. Different companies sought out different solutions. Some hired psychologists to act as consultants for newly minted managers. (Thomas Gordon\u2019s Leader Effectiveness Training, which emphasized active listening and no-lose conflict resolution and was popular at the time, was later adapted into a popular parenting technique in the 1970s). Others, like Lockheed, sent a dozen or so trainees every year to Harvard Business School for the management equivalent of finishing school. Industrial-agriculture giant Monsanto set up an extensive interpersonal-skills training and coaching program specifically for its chemists and engineers. One company official described its graduates as \u201cso brilliant, they annoy everyone.\u201d Yet, for all the emphasis on training, the 1950s recipe for management material had little to do with job performance. Evaluations continued to focus on social skills rather than educational achievement or technical ability. And with only a fuzzy understanding of the precursors to social success, top executives developed lists of must-have skills that became increasingly generalized. In 1957, The New York Times tackled the issue by publishing two lists of skills. One was drawn from a corporate personnel manual, the other from a kindergarten report card: List A: Dependability; Stability; Imagination; Originality; Self-expression; Health and vitality; Ability to plan and control; Cooperation. List B: Can be depended on; Contributes to the good work of others; Accepts and uses criticism; Thinks critically; Shows initiative; Plans work well; Physical resistance; Self-expression; Creative ability. A successful executive in 1950s America, in short, was expected to have essentially the same skills as a well-behaved four-year-old. (B is the kindergarten list, by the way.) In the decades that followed, corporate hierarchies became inflated with executive deadweight as the personality tests proved a poor means of picking boardroom winners. Companies began to doubt whether it was worth trying to train talent internally when it could be poached from other companies. Human resources departments and executive-training programs dwindled. By the time the dot-com boom took hold in the 1990s, driving demand for a new generation of managerial talent, companies had all but abandoned the goal of developing social skills in-house. Yet the idea that personality and success were entwined had not gone away. Coaches who might have taken company jobs were going direct to the masses instead. Stephen R. Covey\u2019s The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, published in 1989, would eventually sell 25 million copies. (A few years after it appeared, President Bill Clinton mused that American productivity would greatly increase if people adopted the habits.) A bronzed, square-jawed business guru named Tony Robbins made millions from motivational events and books like Awaken the Giant Within. By now, Freud had been largely forgotten, and personal progress was not just possible, it was easy\u2014it was just that the responsibility for achieving it had shifted to the individual. It was around this time that Olivia began to develop her own highly effective habits. Her timing, it turned out, was good. As she absorbed her collection of self-help books and began adding tools of her own, the corporate landscape was changing in a way that she would soon exploit. The tech boom had already propelled more engineer-minded people like herself to the top of multimillion-dollar businesses. Many were, in the language of Monsanto, brilliant enough to annoy others. Some were also intolerant of those less brilliant. According to The Wall Street Journal, Bill Gates once reacted to the opening of a presentation by a Microsoft employee with the remark, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing about that slide I like.\u201d A few moments later, he asked the presenter, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just give up your options and join the Peace Corps?\u201d This was the late 1990s, and Microsoft dominated the world of personal computing. Yet a demand for more holistic leaders was emerging. At Apple, where Steve Jobs was insisting that products be both functional and beautiful, executives were incorporating not just engineers and salespeople but also designers into their multidisciplinary teams. The company\u2019s success meant the practice became ingrained in Silicon Valley business culture. \u201cApple changed the game,\u201d said Kelli Richards, who served as the director of music and entertainment markets at Apple for most of the decade. \u201cApple put it out there that they wanted employees who are experts, yet who also have the capacity to work as part of a cross-functional team.\u201d Companies needed managers who were technical and charismatic. Geeks, yes, but not dorks. This is no longer a new idea. It isn\u2019t enough any more just to be smart. You also have to be able to interact with people. And that is easier said than done. It is one thing to grasp the rationale for social skills, but to actually become more charismatic? That\u2019s tough. As Olivia finished her fourth year in law school, her transition was almost complete. True, she was still a bit of a bookworm; she was studying for a dual master\u2019s degree in French and German business law, after all. But she was also teaching sailing lessons in the summers, performing with a comedy improv troupe that she had founded, and freelancing for Forbes magazine. She wasn\u2019t just busy, she was social. A photo from her 21st birthday party, in 2000, shows a group of costumed law students, some dressed as angels, others as devils. Olivia stands among them, her arms thrown around two young men holding plastic pitchforks. Her red-painted lips form a grin that matches the sparkly horns glued to her headband. A few years prior, her classmates wanted her kicked out of school. Now the awkward nerd was the center of the party. Eventually, other people began to take notice of her transformation. After university, Olivia moved to New York to work as a freelance publicist. She would talk with journalists, and one reporter kept asking about the social tools she had developed. A short time later, a profile of Olivia appeared in the international edition of Le Figaro. The piece emphasized how she had created a set of personal leadership and communication tools. Soon Olivia was getting calls from executives. They wanted to know how she had transformed herself\u2014and they wanted her to help them do the same.  AARON HAS ALWAYS BEEN SMART, the kind of kid who gets good grades and stays out of trouble. But he is also, in his own words, \u201ckind of an asshole.\u201d He remembers a moment, over a decade ago now, when he was queuing for movie tickets. The show was due to start in a few minutes, but an older woman at the head of the line was taking her time. Aaron recalls her putting rhetorical questions to the cashier: Do I like comedies? Maybe I want to see a drama. Do you think this is a good movie? Finally, he couldn\u2019t take it any more. He burst to the front of the queue, pushed her out of the way and demanded to buy a ticket. \u201cEveryone kind of stopped and stared,\u201d he told me. \u201cEven my friend was like, \u2018I can\u2019t believe you did that.\u2019 But I was like, what? I had no idea I had done anything wrong.\u201d (Aaron is a pseudonym; he asked that his real name not be used for professional reasons.) For a long time, Aaron was able to use his intelligence to get by in social situations. He finished high school with honors and got accepted to the University of Pennsylvania, where he spent most of his time \u201cin a drunken blur.\u201d But after he graduated, he had trouble finding a job. His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was strong, but he kept getting rejections after companies brought him in for an interview. Clearly something was going wrong\u2014but he wasn\u2019t convinced there was anything he could do about it. \u201cI thought being socially awkward was just part of who I was,\u201d he said. Eventually he was offered a job at Google. He liked it at first: Everyone was smart and the fast pace appealed to him. But after a few months, he noticed he was getting tired. As a natural introvert, he found the carousel of meetings had started to wear on him. He got into arguments with colleagues who were offended by his brusque manner. His diet suffered. He began sleeping poorly. Google signed him up for a leadership-training seminar, but he ended up making fun of the facilitator. \u201cSome of these business coaches have these one-size-fits-all programs that are downright cultish,\u201d he said. \u201cYou feel like you\u2019re on late-night television, and they\u2019re selling you the same kind of crap you sold someone else. It\u2019s mass leadership production.\u201d Exhausted and looking for a new working environment, Aaron left Google, following his boss\u2014who liked the quality of his work despite the occasional outbursts\u2014to another major corporation in the Bay Area. Once again, Aaron was asked to receive leadership coaching, but this time it was Olivia giving the training. When he first met her, Aaron was hesitant, even downright rude. He tried alternately ignoring and mocking her. But Olivia didn\u2019t get flustered. \u201cJust let me follow you around for one day, and listen to what I have to say,\u201d she suggested. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, fine. What do you have to lose?\u201d That was two years ago. A few days before her housewarming party, I watched as Olivia sat in her living room, across a table from Aaron. A neat-looking man, he wore the deliberately dressed-down uniform of Silicon Valley executives: dark fitted jeans, a blue sweater pulled over a collared shirt and leather dress shoes. He smoothed his shaggy brown hair, which had been flattened slightly by his cycle helmet, and pulled a large black Moleskine notebook from his messenger bag. They discussed an internal job move that Aaron was preparing for, which required convincing a colleague to transfer into his current position. He scribbled notes as they talked. His potential successor was well positioned, Olivia observed. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty spineless,\u201d Aaron said, one eyebrow rising slightly. \u201cSo I think if I put a little pressure on her\u2026\u201d \u201cHave that conversation with her in a nice, warm voice,\u201d Olivia said. Aaron tried. \u201cHi, how are you dooooooing?\u201d His tone was reminiscent of a sarcastic kindergarten teacher. \u201cNot patronizing or condescending,\u201d Olivia said, firmly. \u201cDammit.\u201d Aaron sighed. \u201cI need a puppy.\u201d \u201cBorrow mine.\u201d When Olivia started coaching Aaron, she gave him an unusual list of suggestions: change his diet, fix his sleep schedule, and move apartments. Under different circumstances, this was the kind of advice that, as Aaron puts it, he would have judged \u201ccomplete and utter horseshit.\u201d Yet he understands that her suggestions aren\u2019t random. After Olivia\u2019s own transformation, she looked back at what she had achieved with her own social skills and decided to systematize the process. Inspired by her father\u2019s scientific approach and her mother\u2019s work in psychology, Olivia began reading about the science of the brain. She returned to the library, and began to see parallels between the academic findings and the self-help techniques she had found so effective for herself. Eventually she combined her tools, and the science behind them, into what might be called a practical theory of charisma. Olivia started creating her theory by examining her own behavior. She characterized herself as an introvert, because social interaction exhausted her. Yet she wasn\u2019t shy. She started conversations, but small talk wore her out. She would begin to feel tired, then anxious, then outright nervous. She would talk faster and lose her train of thought. Her facial expressions would become strained. She might sweat. And this could happen regardless of whether she understood the subject of the conversation. She began to view her awkwardness as a process that started in her mind and manifested in her actions. When she was working on a story for Forbes and felt she had a reason for introducing herself to people, for example, she noticed she would hold an upright stance\u2014more so than when she approached someone at a party. Her personality didn\u2019t change, just her internal sense of comfort, and the way her actions appeared to others. Eventually, she began to think of social interaction as the product of three categories of skills: technical, external, and internal. Technical skills are raw brainpower. They include the ability to follow complex directions or derive solutions to challenging problems. Most of the engineers she works with rate themselves highly in these areas. They\u2019re also, she says, the least important when it comes to developing a charismatic personality. External skills are more important, albeit at a surface level. They\u2019re the things we associate with successful salespeople: a welcoming smile, a sympathetic nod of the head, a warm handshake. These actions are part of what we call charisma\u2014but only if they feel genuine. And that\u2019s the problem, at least for people for whom these behaviors don\u2019t come naturally. We can sense a strained expression or faked interest, and neither appeals. Olivia cites a Stanford University study in which researchers scanned the brains of subjects shown pictures of people trying to hide their real feelings. The observers\u2019 brains reacted as if a threat were present. The solution to this conundrum\u2014that external skills are important to charisma, but faking them can backfire\u2014rests with internal skills. These have to do with understanding what is happening inside your head, and knowing how to handle it. Internal skills include the ability to sit with discomfort, to be mindful of the feelings that arise in a given situation\u2014and to have enough self-compassion not to be overrun by those feelings. These are the skills that allow you to bypass the feelings of anxiety, fear, and doubt that rise in high-pressure scenarios. And while an internal state can\u2019t be faked, it can be manipulated. Done right, the results of that process can be transformative. The placebo effect might be thought of as such a manipulation: Create an internal feeling of having received treatment, say by administering a sugar pill that looks like a real drug, and your body may act as if the treatment were real. Olivia believes charisma can work in much the same way: imagine a situation in which you would be warm, generous, and confident\u2014like playing with a puppy\u2014and your internal tinkering will lead to real changes in your external behaviors. This, in a nutshell, is Olivia\u2019s recipe for instant charisma. \u201cCharismatic behaviors must originate in your mind,\u201d she wrote in the The Charisma Myth, which was published in 2012. \u201cWhat your mind believes, your body manifests.\u201d Her coaching now consists largely of helping her clients trick their minds using the methods she has developed. Her executives are tutored in techniques like \u201cresponsibility transfer,\u201d in which they learn to alleviate the stress of uncertainty by imagining a benevolent, universal force assuming control of their lives, and \u201crewriting reality,\u201d which involves undoing the anguish of a painful experience by coming up with alternative scenarios that transform the event from distressing to excusable. Visualizations are key. Brad Ludden, one of Olivia\u2019s clients, says that the technique has helped him improve his public-speaking skills, and that he uses it before almost all important meetings. Ludden, a professional kayaker who founded a nonprofit that takes kids with cancer on aquatic adventures, is charismatic by normal social standards, but becomes intimidated around CEOs. \u201cI\u2019m the kind of guy who\u2019s used to being on the river, not a boardroom,\u201d he says. Before a big meeting, Ludden closes his eyes. In an instant, he is back on the Zambezi River, on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. Mist is everywhere. The roar of Victoria Falls fills his ears. His arms ache\u2014he has just fought his way up a dangerous stretch of rapids. A steep drop lies before him, and a camera crew to his side. He wants to get it over with, but he has to wait until the director tells him to go. He wonders who will tell his mother if he dies. No, he thinks. I can\u2019t let that happen. He calms his breathing. Time slows down, and he becomes aware of every movement. He is Neo in the Matrix. He pushes his kayak into the rapids. \u201cThat moment, everything went perfectly,\u201d Ludden said. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt so confident, moved so deliberately. I figure if I could be present and calm in that situation, when I was in front of scary rapids, I should be able to overcome anything.\u201d Like Ludden, Aaron has noticed himself change since he started working with Olivia. He gets into fewer arguments. When he feels that people are in the wrong, he no longer feels an uncontrollable urge to correct them. He no longer fixates on opposing viewpoints, or spends hours in rhetorical email battles. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, her suggestions can be weird,\u201d Aaron said. But, he added, \u201cYou hear her story and you think about yourself in high school, and you ask yourself, \u2018Do I really want to be the same way the rest of my life?\u2019\u201d After two years of tutoring in techniques like these, Aaron is still working with Olivia. Back in the living room, he reflected on Olivia\u2019s advice for helping him communicate with more warmth. \u201cThinking of puppies while I talk to people helps a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course it does,\u201d she said patiently. \u201cThe satisfaction we get from animal connections is different than the one we get from humans. We register it differently. Thinking about puppies translates to the voice, triggers your brain\u2019s emotional center.\u201d \u201cEventually,\u201d she added, \u201cwe both know you are going to need your own dog.\u201d  WHAT SHOULD WE MAKE of Olivia\u2019s charisma science? At one level\u2014a 30,000-foot view of the question\u2014there are trends that support her ideas. Neuroscience has come a long way since the 1950s, when most researchers believed that the adult brain was like a newly completed building\u2014a static structure that we inhabit, but do not renovate. Whatever brain structure and wiring you ended up with after early childhood, you had to live with. Sure, people could learn basic techniques to adapt to their circumstances, but they weren\u2019t thought to be reorganizing the way their brains worked. One implication was that there was only so much you could do for individuals who didn\u2019t \u201cget it.\u201d We now know that the brain is not so static. Using fMRI machines and other brain-scanning devices, researchers have watched subjects\u2019 brains adapt and evolve during learning tasks. When a person learns new motor skills\u2014simple piano exercises, for instance\u2014neural connections in areas of the cortex that control movement are reconfigured. A small rewiring job, if you will. Similar changes take place when we learn how to navigate a maze or memorize a text. This idea\u2014that training can alter the physical structure of the brain\u2014was a revelation to Olivia. She takes it to mean that people using her tools aren\u2019t just going through the motions of being charismatic\u2014they are actually changing who they are, right down to the level of their neurons. In some cases, scientists have seen the same effect when people do nothing more than think about learning new skills. Regularly imagining playing the piano, for example, is enough to prompt a little cortical rearrangement. And meditation, one of Olivia\u2019s key tools, can change the structure of several areas of the brain, including some that regulate emotions. Olivia\u2019s science citations also appear to stand up to closer inspection, at least according to William Bosl, a Harvard neuroscientist. Like many of her contacts, Bosl met Olivia at a party. It was two years ago, on a trip to San Francisco. A friend had invited him to a party in an unusual venue: a cargo ship that had been converted into apartments. It was crowded and dark. About 30 people crammed into the quarters of the ship, which was docked at a pier on the bay. Bosl soon lost track of his friend, and found himself as the awkward guy nobody seems to know. He was just thinking of leaving when he bumped into Olivia. He couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on it, but there was something unusual about her. Her pronunciation of certain words, for example. She didn\u2019t exactly have an accent, but she formed each vowel with an inordinate amount of precision\u2014\u201csiweet\u201d instead of \u201csweet.\u201d She was confused by cultural references; she didn\u2019t own a TV, she said. Yet at the same time, she was kind and cheerful and, to Bosl, instantly likable. \u201cWhen I mentioned what I did for a living, she seemed especially interested,\u201d Bosl said. Olivia said she was writing a book on the science of charisma, and asked Bosl if he would look at the science sections of the manuscript. He had only known her for a few minutes, but he readily agreed. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t like a salesperson exactly, but she definitely wasn\u2019t inhibited,\u201d he said. \u201cShe seemed to really care about me and my work, and I wanted to help her out.\u201d Like Olivia, Bosl was interested in using neuroscience to probe social skills. In one recent paper, he had explored whether scalp electrodes could be used to measure the brain\u2019s electrical activity and screen infants for autism. For the next few weeks, he spent his free time reviewing Olivia\u2019s manuscript. For the most part, the science looked accurate. \u201cThere were only a few places where I was like, I don\u2019t know about this,\u201d he said, \u201cand when I found things like that I would write to her and she would change them.\u201d Yet the most serious criticism of Olivia\u2019s use of science isn\u2019t the big idea she espouses or the validity of the individual studies she cites\u2014it\u2019s that the definition of charisma is so slippery. Visualization techniques have been extensively studied in sports, where the desired goal\u2014more accurate putting, a faster backhand\u2014can be clearly defined. Outside of sports, psychologists have almost nothing to say about the link between visualization and charisma. In fact, the field has very little to say about charisma itself: Scientists don\u2019t generally like to study something they cannot define or measure. Activity in the brain can, of course, be measured. Yet the connection between rewiring studies and charisma is tentative. Meditating your way to a thicker cerebral cortex does not mean you\u2019ve become a magnetic leader. No one has scanned the brains of executives undergoing charisma training, and, even if they had, it is not clear what they would look for: If a charisma module exists, neuroscientists are yet to find it. \u201cThe problem is all our brains and personalities are so different, it\u2019s difficult to tell what makes anyone unique,\u201d said Bosl. \u201cEven with fMRI scanning, which is the brain technology du jour, at this point it\u2019s so crude that the only thing you could tell a charismatic person about their brain is whether or not they have a tumor or a lesion.\u201d If charisma is something that can\u2019t yet be measured, does Bosl believe in Olivia\u2019s professional transformation? He thought for a while after I asked him and then recalled an event he attended shortly after Olivia\u2019s book had been published. It was a big party, and she was asked to make a speech in front of the whole room. She seemed hesitant at first. When she spoke, she had a loud, clear voice, but she seemed more comfortable when the focus was on someone else. \u201cShe didn\u2019t come across as someone who was naturally charismatic since age two,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it worked for her. It was actually kind of endearing.\u201d Though Bosl admires Olivia\u2019s work, he says it\u2019s distinctly different from his own approach to understanding the brain. \u201cPop science like Olivia\u2019s book is not science, but rather the popular reporting of science,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that reporting can sometimes take liberties and go beyond what\u2019s actually supported by the literature.\u201d But then again, he added, \u201cThis is a woman who got me to agree to help edit her book within an hour of meeting her for the first time. You can talk about the brain all you want, and I don\u2019t know if hers looks any different now than it did when she was an awkward teenager. But from a practical point of view, look at where she is now.\u201d  TODAY, SILICON VALLEY IS increasingly obsessed with how to build a successful\u2014and palatable\u2014management culture. This is partly because the area\u2019s success stories are so big. Executives at Google and Facebook must consider many layers of management, thousands of workers and millions\u2014or even billions\u2014of users. But it is also because the ingredients for technological success have changed. \u201cIf you look at all the notable technology in the last one or two years, they all incorporate social elements,\u201d said Joe Cheung, a longtime Silicon Valley recruiter who has worked for companies such as Netflix and Salesforce. (Cheung currently works for Medium, Matter\u2019s parent company.) \u201cNowadays, we expect executives to be on Twitter and Facebook engaging with customers. We want programmers who understand that all apps have a social layer. Everyone in the tech world needs to be expanding their social sensibility.\u201d It\u2019s not just about the technology: Services like Facebook are so embedded in our society that a narrow band of technology executives have, by default, assumed a sort of global leadership position. They are soothsayers, courted by politicians, thinkers, and journalists. And their personal brands matter\u2014just look at the rivalry between Apple and Microsoft. Steve Jobs was as intelligent as Bill Gates and, when it came to his personal life, as fiercely private. But Jobs was unusually magnetic on stage, and the media chose to see Gates as a dork. This was an unhelpful narrative for Microsoft, which for many years has battled\u2014and failed\u2014to be perceived as a creative company. Many of the entrepreneurs drawn to Silicon Valley in recent years realize this. Like Aaron, they know they cannot coast by on intellect. But the Jobs brand of business charisma doesn\u2019t come easily to many of them. (Or, to be fair, most of us.) The next generation has found the transition from technology to leadership no less awkward than the engineers of the 1950s. And those who falter are declared a liability\u2014too stiff, too dorky. During Facebook\u2019s rapid rise to prominence, for instance, Mark Zuckerberg was given an ultimatum. In the company\u2019s early days, when Zuckerberg was barely out of university, he was uncomfortable with leadership. He was ambitious, but often crumbled when required to put a human face on his technical leadership. In front of an audience, he would sweat and struggle to communicate. As the company grew, staff rankled at Zuckerberg\u2019s inability to cope with social nuance, and his advisers, sensing revolt, urged him to seek help. As David Kirkpatrick recounts in The Facebook Effect, Zuckerberg hired an executive coach to improve his people skills and took elocution lessons to help him with expression. The problems lessened, and Zuckerberg is now a competent public speaker. Among the biggest adherents of leadership training in Silicon Valley is Marissa Mayer, who became CEO of Yahoo last year after an extremely successful decade at Google, where she rose from engineering to become one of the company\u2019s most high-profile executives. In 2002, a few years into her time at Google, Mayer realized that the company needed to train a new generation of leaders to steer the search-engine giant as it expanded. And she didn\u2019t want to copy Microsoft, where bullish MBAs dominated. Mayer\u2019s answer was a fast-track program called Associate Product Managers, which, in an echo of the leadership programs of GE almost a century before, focused on identifying employees with the social skills needed to oversee ferociously smart\u2014and occasionally recalcitrant\u2014engineers. APM has become an internal incubator for Google. The most talented recruits are sent to a boot camp, where they are made more capable, more approachable, more charismatic. Google invests a lot in the program; those who complete it and stay at the company become strong enough leaders to justify the costs. Some leave, of course. Among APM\u2019s graduates is Bret Taylor, who worked at Google until 2007, when he left to form FriendFeed\u2014which was later acquired by Facebook, where Taylor was chief technology officer until last year. Google\u2019s approach is percolating through the rest of the industry. With Mayer at Yahoo and many APM graduates elsewhere in Silicon Valley, the thinking may become pervasive. Yet there is no small irony to what Olivia does, or indeed to the many other executive coaches who help the technology industry\u2019s smartest minds become more charming. Charisma is, in part, the ability to be genuinely mindful of others; to be emotionally aware. If intuition were our guide, we might assume that this couldn\u2019t be learned. We might think that it was a blessing enjoyed by those born with an extra dose of empathy and the intelligence to make use of it. We wouldn\u2019t imagine that charisma could be encapsulated in a series of tools, any more than a novel could be condensed into a tweet. Which is not to say that Olivia and her peers don\u2019t succeed in making their clients more charismatic. But perhaps only in Silicon Valley would a group of engineers think they could hack their way to charisma with a series of neuroscientific shortcuts. IT WAS A HOT AFTERNOON in May of this year, and San Francisco seemed full of people dressed as if they were auditioning for a summer clothing commercial. Pastel shorts and cotton tank tops abounded. In the shade of South Park, a few blocks from Olivia\u2019s apartment, groups of friends watched dogs play and sipped cool drinks from red plastic cups. Olivia swept past in dark sunglasses, a black velvet dress, and black tights. She walked into an intersection lit up by a do-not-walk signal. \u201cOops,\u201d she said, as a car whizzed past. She was in a hurry. \u201cI don\u2019t want to keep the kids waiting too long,\u201d she said. The \u201ckids\u201d were a group of 30-something Swiss business professionals in town for an executive training camp. Olivia was going to field questions about her book, and though she doesn\u2019t always like speaking to small groups, which can trigger her introverted side and sap her energy, she likes Q&As for their informality. \u201cI don\u2019t need to prepare anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI can just show up and see what they need to learn.\u201d It was one of several pro bono jobs, including speaking gigs and coaching sessions, that she accepts every year. We arrived at a small, chic industrial space not far from Olivia\u2019s apartment. The room was split between a lecture area and a series of desks occupied by technology startups. Extra monitors and granola bars littered the tables, at which half a dozen workers typed away on their laptops. Olivia set up in the back of the room as the visitors shuffled past the programmers and took their seats. In an untidy hand, she wrote a single word in green dry-erase marker: \u201ccharisma.\u201d When she addresses large groups, it\u2019s easy to see why Olivia is one of the best-known speakers on charisma coaching. I watched a video of a talk she gave last year at Stanford, to over a thousand students, and she appeared professional and poised. Asked a question, she would hesitate just long enough to seem thoughtful and confident. She seemed to connect with individuals in the audience, and to hold the attention of the group itself. This was not one of those days. She began with \u201cSprechen Sie Hochdeutsch?\u201d\u2014do you speak Standard German? Olivia speaks fluent German, but there are several regional dialects. No, they said, they spoke a different form of Swiss German. \u201cOh God,\u201d she mock lamented. The audience laughed politely. She curtsied. In English, she launched into a summary of her book, explaining how the brain can be rewired for almost anything, including innovation and charisma. Audience members jotted down notes on yellow legal pads. Most were male project leaders interested in increasing the efficiency of their teams. Olivia suggested a few techniques. Why not have employees brainstorm while playing with pieces of play dough? She threw a few plastic tubs into the crowd. Pink and purple globs spread from person to person. A woman with long wavy brown hair raised her hand. She looked slightly younger than the others and was one of only a few women in the group. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d she asked in a high-pitched, sing-song voice, \u201cbut how do you\u2014\u201d \u201cStop,\u201d Olivia interrupted. \u201cCome on up here.\u201d The woman\u2019s blue eyes grew wide. She dusted off her tight white jeans and pink blouse. Hesitantly, she rose and walked to the front of the room, facing her colleagues. They stared back in anticipation. Olivia stood next to her and told her to ask her question again. \u201cUm, I was asking, how do you prevent someone from\u2014\u201d \u201cYou need to take up more space,\u201d Olivia said, interrupting again. She repositioned the woman so that her stance was wider, like an action figure. \u201cGive up cute and sweet. No one will take you seriously. Try projecting your voice.\u201d The woman nodded, but her posture hunched. She looked back at her seat. \u201cNow talk to the back of the room. See that stuffed animal?\u201d Olivia pointed to a toy donkey on a desk further back. \u201cSay, \u2018Come here, donkey.\u2019\u201d Her voice was clear and firm. \u201cCome here, donkey,\u201d the woman said. It sounded more like a question than a command, as Olivia pointed out. The audience started to chuckle. Several leaned forward in their seats. Try again, Olivia said. And again. And again. Olivia\u2019s coaching style is not for everyone. She has a gift for identifying her clients\u2019 social weaknesses, just as she once identified them in herself. When something really irks her\u2014a simpering tone, breathy uncertainty, poor posture\u2014she says she cannot help but take immediate action. Since Olivia has honed her social awareness, to sit and do nothing would be to endure the social equivalent of nails scraping on a blackboard. Her critiques are harsh, but an expected part of the process when she coaches a private client, who pay up to $100,000 for six months of unlimited access to Olivia\u2019s advice. Before she agrees to work with a client, she usually ensures that he or she is open to this brand of critique. But on days like today, when her feedback is unsolicited, the reactions are not always positive. \u201cIt\u2019s about a fifty-fifty chance that they won\u2019t take it well,\u201d Olivia said when I asked her about it after the talk. \u201cHalf the time people end up loving the honesty. The other half of the time, they see it as plain awkward.\u201d From an observer\u2019s standpoint, it was awkward. Olivia\u2019s technical message was clearly coming through (she next decided to help the woman with the volume of her voice by suddenly pushing on her diaphragm), but she seemed so focused on the end goal that, to use her own terms, her internal and external skills were falling short. After several more attempts, Olivia released the woman from her grasp. \u201cYou can do it,\u201d she told her, and stepped back to observe her creation. The woman furrowed her brow, fixing her gaze on the fuzzy brown stuffed toy in the back of the room. She widened her stance and let her arms fall to her sides. She took a deep breath. \u201cCOME. HERE. DONKEY.\u201d The audience clapped, and despite the blush rising in her cheeks, she smiled. \u201cBetter,\u201d Olivia said, with a look of genuine pride. She patted the woman on the back. \u201cGood girl.\u201d FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS, Olivia has been a regular at the invitation-only Renaissance Weekend events, which attract senior politicians, Nobel laureates, venture capitalists, and Hollywood screenwriters, as well as a Pulitzer winner or two. The organizers have even granted her a special privilege, a sign of her insider status: the power to invite others. The first year she brought two. Now she brings over 20. It\u2019s got to the point where her posse has adopted a club name of sorts. She swears they chose it themselves: \u201cThe friends of Olivia.\u201d This circle\u2014Olivia\u2019s clients-cum-friends\u2014expands ever outward. She recently contracted with Penguin to write a second book, this time with her friend and fellow coach Judah Pollack, about how entrepreneurs can increase innovation. And last May she was appointed the director of innovative leadership at StartX, a nonprofit set up to accelerate the development of Stanford\u2019s top entrepreneurs. Olivia prides herself on her intuition; she claims that she can determine whether a person will be successful within a minute of being introduced. At least in terms of the future of business coaching, she seems to have got it right. By 10 on the night of Olivia\u2019s house-warming party, most of the guests had moved on to other festivities. She smiled as she shooed the stragglers out, reminding them that she had to pack for an early-morning flight to New York. Then she removed her earrings and her shiny red shoes. She took off her tights and threw them to her foster puppy, which used its teeth to test the limits of their stretchiness. Then she packed: a toothbrush and makeup; non-wrinkle outfits in her favorite power colors of black and red; noise-cancelling earphones for the plane; earplugs for the hotel; and, finally, a small stack of well-worn photographs that she takes on every trip. Olivia spread the pictures out on the bed and looked at the faces of the people she considers closest to her. Pollack, her fellow business coach. Shoshana, her meditation teacher. Christien, her favorite cousin, long since passed away. The Dalai Lama, whom she\u2019s never met, but keeps as a focus on the idea of mindfulness. The photos were a mixture of friends and teachers and totems. They help her remember all she has built for herself. When Olivia arrived at her hotel room the next day, she would spread the pictures out on the anonymous countertops to infuse them with a sense of warmth. It wouldn\u2019t quite be home, but sometimes it\u2019s enough to pretend. free downloadaudio \u2022 Kindle \u2022 ePub This story was written by Teresa Chin edited by Jim Giles, fact-checked by Cameron Bird, copy-edited by Tina Lee.

On Saturday, after defending the characters of both men and after it was revealed members of his administration such as Chief of Staff John Kelly knew of these allegations beforehand, President Trump sent out a disturbing tweet broadly defending men accused of violence against women and sexual assault. \u201cPeoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSome are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused\u200a\u2014\u200alife and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as due process?\u201d Of course, the irony of a man elected President of the United States with over a dozen women having accused him of sexual abuse claiming \u201cthere is no recovery for men accused of assault\u201d\u2014while having formerly said famous men can \u201cdo anything\u201d to women\u2014is hard to miss. And while the dialogue around sexual assault, violence against women and American political parties has been reinvigorated by last week\u2019s events, it\u2019s always existed. Unfortunately, too often, the seemingly bipartisan issue of women\u2019s safety and right to freedom from violence and sexual abuse is anything but bipartisan. There are too many examples of this. It\u2019s not just the men and candidates the Republican Party chooses to endorse and support, and the records of abuse the Party overlooks, although, for certain, there\u2019s a long record of this. It\u2019s also the legislative decisions of the party\u2019s representatives, from partisan rejections of the Violence Against Women Act to objection to bills expanding funding and access to rape kits. In the larger conversation around sexual assault, the Republican Party has transformed a most basic women\u2019s right into a political issue when it really shouldn\u2019t be. While exacerbated by recent events, this shift has been a long time in the making, and women and sexual assault survivors suffer the consequences of their experiences being hijacked into a political game. The accusations against Donald Trump, whom the Republican Party nominated and elected, range from harassment, forcible kissing and inappropriate touching to rape. Decades ago, his first wife Ivana once alleged that he had beat and then raped her after he was disappointed by the work of a surgeon that Ivana had recommended to him; in 2015, Trump\u2019s lawyer said marital rape was legally nonexistent. Last year as the #MeToo movement began to pick up steam, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called the more than a dozen women accusing Trump liars without so much as blinking an eye. In response to comparisons of Trump and former Minnesota Sen. Al Franken, a Democrat and another man accused of sexual misconduct, Sanders said that only men who have admitted to their actions should be investigated, sending the terrifying message that the Republican White House exclusively listens to the voices of powerful men, and will not even hear out, let alone believe, survivors. Just last year, the White House went all-out for Roy Moore, a Republican Senate candidate accused by multiple women of sexual assault and molestation while they were teenagers and he was in his thirties. In addition to these women, handfuls of community members have corroborated the women\u2019s allegations with accounts of how it was widely known in the community that Moore\u200a\u2014\u200awho was banned from a local mall for harassing teenage girls\u200a\u2014\u200apreyed on young, underage women. And while some key Republicans did actively and vocally speak against Moore and call for him to end his campaign, McConnell declined for Moore to suspend his campaign to allow voters to decide, and after a brief pause, the RNC resumed funding Moore\u2019s campaign. The dialogue around Republican enabling was brought once again to the forefront last week when former White House secretary Rob Porter and former speechwriter David Sorensen became the latest men working for Trump caught with records of abusing women. After Trump became president in an election that told survivors everywhere that their experiences didn\u2019t matter, that their abusers could not only survive but thrive with impunity, Trump appointed Steve Bannon as his chief adviser. While known for his aggressively racist stances and hand in revitalizing the white nationalist movement in the United States, in 1996, Bannon was also charged with a misdemeanor for domestic violence, battery, and dissuading a witness regarding an incident with a former wife. Trump formerly nominated Andrew Puzder, the anti-labor chief executive of a line of fast food chains, to be labor secretary; when accusations that he had beat his ex-wife resurfaced, Puzder removed himself. And before the election, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was charged with battery when he aggressively shoved a female reporter out of Trump\u2019s way. These cases are often deflected by claims the Trump administration or campaign team just wasn\u2019t aware, but there are two big problems with this. First of all, particularly in the case of Rob Porter, there\u2019s evidence Trump, and his staff knew; for certain, the Republican National Committee and all the top party leaders who endorsed Trump knew of the myriad allegations against him. Second of all, ignorance isn\u2019t an excuse; any presidential administration\u2019s background checks and vetting should catch the same things journalists do, and they should not ignore. Whether or not they know, they should\u2014no, must\u2014know, and to not know is to be irresponsible and complicit in enabling and empowering men who abuse women. To praise and defend the honor of men who are exposed sends an even worse message about Republican leadership\u2019s stance on sexual violence, and perception of it as so irrelevant and inconsistent that men who beat their wives still deserve best wishes and thank you\u2019s. And, of course, it\u2019s not just members of Trump\u2019s administration. The Republican president stood by the likes of Fox News\u2019 former and late CEO Roger Ailes, and former host Bill O\u2019Reilly, both of whom had myriad accusations of sexual harassment and assault against them. Trump has said nothing about accusations against Steve Wynn, a hotel mogul who recently resigned as the RNC\u2019s finance chair after being accused of sexual misconduct. On the other hand, Ronna McDaniel has rejected comparisons between Wynn to Franken and Harvey Weinstein, both aligned with the Democratic Party because \u201cunlike Harvey Weinstein and Al Franken and others, Steve has denied them.\u201d In other words, to Republicans like Trump and the RNC\u2019s leader, the only word that matters is that of the accused man. But despite Trump\u2019s obsession with defending men and, against all credible research and common decency, his branding of women and survivors as liars and misandristic oppressors, it bears mentioning that the men he stands by are white. Back in the \u201990s, Trump bought a full-page ad in the New York Daily News not only calling five men of color accused of raping a white woman guilty, but also demanding the death penalty. The five men were all exonerated by DNA evidence, but as late as 2016, Trump has stood by his stance. Trump also notably rose to fame\u2014and to the top of Republican Party voter polling\u2014in a speech calling Mexican immigrants rapists. It seems the only time he acknowledges survivors, it is to represent them not as human women worthy of justice and advocacy, but as racist talking points. Donald Trump may not be representative of every single member of the Republican Party, but he is the Party\u2019s standard-bearer nonetheless, and the one backed and crowned by the RNC, by Mitch McConnell, by Paul Ryan. And time and again he has sent the clear message that he wants the Party to stand with domestic abusers and men accused of assault, that his White House wants the dialogue around sexual assault to shift into a conversation around perceived male victimhood, and the erasure of women\u2019s voices, needs and right to justice. Last September, education secretary Betsy DeVos announced that she would no longer follow Obama-era guidelines that lowered the standards of evidence for survivors reporting sexual assault, and investigated or took away funding from universities that failed to investigate and address sexual assault reports in a timely manner. In the months before DeVos\u2019 announcement, Candice Jackson, who leads the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, cruelly and falsely claimed most survivors reporting assault were simply drunk or regretted having consensual sex. \u201cNinety percent of them fall into the category of \u2018we were both drunk,\u2019 \u2018we broke up, and six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right,\u2019\u201d she said of sexual assault reports. That same summer, DeVos met with multiple men\u2019s and accused people\u2019s rights groups. Like her boss, DeVos has been part of shifting the issue of sexual assault into one of a false narrative of male victimhood, and the conflation of women finally finding the footing to fight back against a system of inequality, violence, and oppression to one of persecution. It\u2019s important to fight back against this \u201creverse sexism\u201d myth Republicans are peddling, before discussing anything else. More than two-thirds of sexual assaults go unreported, for myriad reasons. For starters, it\u2019s not uncommon for survivors to suffer from PTSD or other mental health ailments as a result of their experiences, and reporting their experiences could force them to relive their trauma. Many survivors report discomfort with how law enforcement or other officials they report to treat them, and there are far too many cases and anecdotes of sexist stereotyping and slut-shaming used to dismiss, disbelieve and even punish women. On top of this, the majority of survivors are hurt by people they are close to; many survivors don\u2019t report as a result of this as they fear it hurts their credibility. And most specific to DeVos, with very, very few exceptions, the only evidence survivors are able to present is their own testimony. Unless their assault is recorded or witnessed by parties who are willing to testify in their favor, or unless they are able to go through the often traumatic process of enduring a forensic exam for a rape kit and additionally see the rape kit tested and not backlogged like most are, a survivor\u2019s word is often all they can offer. And with DeVos now demanding higher standards for evidence, survivors find themselves with little option for recourse. To see men accused of assault and violence against women as the victims is not only profoundly cruel, but also deeply ignorant. A survey by Glamour in conjunction with the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence (NRCDV), the National Network to End Domestic Violence, the National Domestic Violence Hotline, Casa Esperanza and the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence found 60 percent of women between the ages of 18 and 35 have experienced domestic abuse. One in five women on college campuses experience sexual assault or attempted rape. Women are suffering, and Republicans are not only erasing this suffering but also exacerbating it. Of course, Republican politicians were hurting survivors and women long before Trump and DeVos came onto the scene. As recent as 2013, 22 Republican senators dissented in a vote to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. While the VAWA passed, 22 Republicans opposed it for its protections of immigrant women and members of the LGBTQ community, whom the law prohibits discrimination against. At the time, The Atlantic reported that objection also stemmed from perceptions of the VAWA as a \u201cfeminist\u201d attack on \u201cfamily values,\u201d as its existence was conditional on the acknowledgment of patriarchal oppression of women. I\u2019ll let the despicable, intolerant reasonings behind objecting to VAWA speak for themselves. Just last summer, a Georgia GOP Congressman said he would only support funding for rape kit collection and processing in non-sanctuary cities. Notably, Rep. Buddy Carter is also the same man who said he would like to \u201csnatch a knot in their ass,\u201d a euphemism for beating, referring to female Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins for their opposition to the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Across the country, tens of thousands of rape kits go untested, and it\u2019s impossible to know how many women lack the opportunity to have a rape kit at all. The testing of rape kits in states like Colorado and Wyoming has been costly, but has successfully yielded many new leads and even convictions. Just a few years ago in 2014, Senate Republicans stalled a $180 billion funding bill that allocated $41 million to help states and local governments process backlogs of rape kits. Under Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the bill was held back due to partisan conflict over its environmental protections. In other words, Republican leadership opposed a provision that could have made for justice for an unquantifiable number of women across the country\u2014all to protect the coal industry. On top of all of this, speaking of the ACA, at the height of Republican efforts to repeal the health care act last year, many pointed out how doing so would affect victims of domestic abuse, sexual assault, and rape. Before the ACA, insurance companies charged for preexisting conditions that would equate to additional health needs, placing many low-income people with health ailments in an incredibly difficult, sometimes life-or-death position. Now, in consideration of the health treatments and services survivors could need\u200a\u2014\u200afrom emergency room visits and mental health treatment to rape kits and other medication, among other things\u200a\u2014\u200amany feared women and victims of sexual violence could become perceived as liabilities by insurance companies. This could have resulted in sexual abuse and domestic violence becoming \u201cpreexisting conditions\u201d and making survivors pay higher premiums. Perhaps punishing women and survivors wasn\u2019t the driving intent behind Republicans\u2019 dogged pushes to repeal the ACA\u2014but it would have been a consequence, nonetheless. When we think of Republicans and anti-woman stances, the most notable aspect of the GOP party platform is its support for governments\u2019 right to force women to give birth. One of the sole reasons Republicans bring up rape at all\u2014if not to promote nativist, racist narratives like Trump\u2014is to discuss abortion. The mainstream stance among \u201cpro-life\u201d Republicans is that abortion must be illegal with few exceptions including rape, incest, and, sometimes, health circumstances. But there is always ambiguity regarding how women are supposed to demonstrate that they were impregnated by rape, and what standards Republicans would like to see them held to. In addition to this, abortion is also a key\u2014if not the only\u2014reason Republican leaders and voters support certain candidates. Moore\u2019s supporters unfailingly responded to accusations of sexual violence against him by pivoting to his adamant opposition to abortion rights in contrast with his opponent Doug Jones\u2019 support for \u201cbaby-killing.\u201d Moore\u2019s case was a gut-wrenching demonstration of the right wing\u2019s \u201clove the fetus, hate the child\u201d paradigm around abortion; to conservatives, fetuses\u200a\u2014\u200aand holding seats in the Senate, for that matter\u200a\u2014\u200amatter more than born, living young women who are sexually assaulted. Another glowing example of the intermixing of the issues of violence against women and abortion is the notorious quote of former Missouri GOP Rep. Todd Akin, who claimed that in cases of \u201clegitimate rape,\u201d women\u2019s bodies would naturally fight off pregnancy; thus, pregnancy is always the product of consensual sex, and women should be allowed abortions under no circumstances. Akin\u2019s view is hardly mainstream among his party, but it is the product of conservatism\u2019s passionate, blinding disdain for abortion rights so that nothing else\u2014not even justice for survivors of sexual violence\u2014matters but the denial of women\u2019s bodily autonomy. Around the same time GOP Rep. Carter took a stance against equal access to rape kits and testing, Democratic Sen. Patty Murray began working to push through the Survivors\u2019 Access to Supportive Care Act. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Barbara Boxer (D-CA) joined her in her advocacy. Murray\u2019s bill would require the Government Accountability Office to \u201csurvey each state to determine the specific needs and standards of care for sexual assault examinations, create a federal guideline and training program around sexual assault health care\u00a0\u2026 a federal grant to expand training and care offered at hospitals across the country, require colleges to educate students about sexual assault examination services, and build a resource center for hospitals receiving federal funding,\u201d according to Jezebel. Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a leading voice on sexual assault and harassment years before #MeToo, recently sponsored and led the charge for a bill to reform sexual harassment reporting procedure in Congress by eliminating a mandated, months-long waiting period that protects perpetrators. Just this weekend, Gillibrand, whom Trump once implied performed sexual acts in exchange for campaign funding, responded to Trump\u2019s suggestion that accused men don\u2019t receive \u201cdue process\u201d in a particularly savage tweet calling for Congress to hold a hearing on accusations against Trump: \u201cIf he wants due process for the over dozen sexual assault allegations against him, let\u2019s have Congressional hearings tomorrow. I would support that and my colleagues should too.\u201d Amy Klobuchar, another Democratic senator, was behind a bill requiring sexual harassment training for members of Congress, and in the House of Representatives, Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier has worked toward similar goals. For eight years, while campus sexual assault hardly disappeared during the Obama administration, Obama and Biden never ceded an opportunity to raise awareness about survivors\u2019 rights, and the need for resources, supportive guidelines, and preventative measures. The Obama administration will always be remembered for its legacy of advocacy and passion\u2014its revamping of Title IX, its refusal to visit schools that didn\u2019t comply to Title IX guidelines, its support for the VAWA and its emotional appeals for gender equality are a guiding, positive force for Democrats. Certainly, the party is imperfect. The party has seen its Frankens and Weinsteins and Conyers exposed by #MeToo, and its members were, for the most part, admirably swift in denouncing these men and calling for change. Biden\u2019s own record on sexual assault may be strong, but he notoriously oversaw the 1991 Senate confirmation hearing of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, and many are rightfully critical of how he handled the questioning of Anita Hill, a woman who claims Thomas sexually harassed her while she worked for Thomas. These cases are not to be swept under the rug, and everyone regardless of party affiliation must be held accountable. But there is no denying a level partisanship that has unfortunately emerged regarding violence against women and sexual abuse. Surely most Democrats can agree this partisanship is a problem they want to see change, even if it means they\u2019ll no longer have a talking point over Republicans. Violence against women should not be a political issue; it should be a human rights issue. But in the face of one party\u2019s move to embrace and believe women\u2019s voices and create policy change to defend women\u2019s right against violence, another is consistently overlooking and enabling male perpetrators; dangerously weaving distrust of women into legislation and rhetoric alike; and prioritizing ideology over women\u2019s safety. Violence against women shouldn\u2019t be a partisan issue. But the only way we\u2019re going to move past this and see through necessary reforms is by first acknowledging that right now, it is.

Most of those coins are Ethereum tokens, meaning they are cryptocurrencies that exist within the Ethereum blockchain because that\u2019s where they were created. Ethereum is the grand-daddy of altcoins. If you want a long, itemized list of the reasons why Ethereum isn\u2019t done, take a look at my most recent article on The Flippening: Ethereum VS. Bitcoin. It will give you a very good idea why Ethereum is a strong competitor for the throne as the Top Dog cryptocurrency against Bitcoin by the end of 2018. COSS is a startup exchange that is similar to exchanges like Bittrex, GDAX, and Binance. What sets it apart, though, is that it has its own cryptocurrency, too, and you earn a percentage of all of COSS\u2019s transaction fees by holding its cryptocurrency. Think of it kind of like the relationship with NEO and Gas, but instead of generating more currency, it gives you a percentage of what each user pays each time he or she makes a trade on COSS. The cryptocurrency is built atop (you guessed it!) Ethereum as a Token. This means that you can store it on any wallet that is Ethereum ERC20 compatible. Don\u2019t know what that means? Don\u2019t worry. It means you can store it on any private wallet, including Nano Ledger S, My Ether Wallet, and MetaMask. Sure, more experienced cryptocurrency traders that have explored the altcoin world of exchange dividends can argue that COSS isn\u2019t the only one that offers dividends, and it certainly isn\u2019t the only exchange that has its own coin. Binance has its Binance Coin, which offers 50% off trade fees, and Kucoin has its own coin, Kucoin Shares, that offers trade fees, too. I think both Binance Coin and Kucoin Shares have strong potential for growth in 2018, too, but there is one thing that I\u2019m really excited about with COSS that neither Binance nor Kucoin offer: COSS has partnered with a major credit card company to start introducing fiat deposits and withdraws for its exchange. This means that it will start allowing traders to buy and sell cryptocurrencies on its exchange and do it directly through cash, instead of doing BTC, ETH, or LTC transfers. That being said, US citizens will still have to wait for their time to be able to use this feature due to financial regulations. But it is big news for anyone in smaller foreign countries that don\u2019t have access to fiat exchanges like Coinbase or Gemini. First I talked about NEO, then I talked about Ethereum, and now I\u2019m talking about ICON? You must be noticing a pattern now. I love smart-contract platforms. I love them because it gives the cryptocurrency much more value beyond a \u201cstore of value\u201d or a \u201ctransactional item\u201d which leaves much to the mind for speculation. As businesses are built atop these economies, the value of the businesses both from a financial and impact perspective will contribute to the value of the underlying platform. Read this as: it\u2019s no longer about speculation. ICON offers a smart-contracts platform, too. ICON is a Korean-born competitor in the smart-contracts space. As a smart economy, ICON intends to also host ICOs, also. At the end of January 2018, it launched its Main Net. This means that now Decentralized Apps (DApps) can start being built and launched on ICON. Usually, this leads to the eventual emergence of ICOs. At the ICON Annual Summit held at the same time as the Main Net launch, it also showcased 5 different decentralized apps that have already started development on the ICON platform, which may lead to ICOs. In April 2018, ICON will launch its official ICO platform. One of the DApps that have gained the most traction is Nucleus Vision. 2018 is an exciting year for cryptocurrency space. Apart from the recent announcements of governments like South Korea, Japan, India, and even the United States embracing cryptocurrency through regulation, the ideas and technologies are maturing. The four recommended cryptocurrencies listed in this article still have lots of room to grow and mature for both themselves and for the future of the cryptocurrency space.

Yeah, I know right? I figured it is just simply following through an idea you are passionate about, adding to it some promotion, social media, a website and some money management. The rest would sort itself out. That is surely why everyone is doing this right? I became aware very quickly that founding a startup would not be a quick fix to riches or success, and it would be so far from easy. In fact, at times it would be an absolute motherfucker. And even once this following, reputation and momentum is built, it can stop and leave at any minute, for different periods of time and for any number of different reasons. In those moments when the startup begins to struggle, I have succumb to doubt, worry and depression. Say hello to your new worst friend, Founder\u2019s Fatigue. Cosy up, you are going to spend a lot of quality time together. Founder\u2019s fatigue is many things and comes in many forms. When issues and problems arise, it takes a lot of this energy to push through them. This is a basic form of founder\u2019s fatigue\u200a\u2014\u200aliterally a lack of fatigue from founding a business. However it runs deeper, and more serious. When you seek help and guidance from, others won\u2019t always understand how you are feeling. Their support is welcome of course, but they won\u2019t always be able to assist you in this rut. They unknowingly contribute to your fatigue\u200a\u2014\u200ayou will judge yourself against their jobs, earnings, possessions etc, and reaffirm your belief that you picked the wrong way to do this. Unfair on those trying to help, I know\u2026 but that is just they way it is. So who do you turn to? The good news is, it is a universal feeling that even the best experience during their business journey. I have spoken to many founders and startups and most are in the exact same position. They share the same burdens, worries and stresses as each other, and share very similar experiences. They all need to take time off to recharge this creative energy. Taking breaks, going on holidays, taking \u2018alone time\u2019 or talking to members of your startup team can all help alleviate the symptoms of founder\u2019s fatigue. So talk to other startups when the founder fatigue gets the better of you. Mingle with others in similar situations. Get together and have a good old bitch and moan about starting up and the problems that come with it. Misery loves company after all! As impossible as it sounds, try to enjoy the up\u2019s and the down\u2019s. It is easier to do this when you know that every founder and startup goes through the same.

Persistance is an awesome thing, and I\u2019m going to talk about it in a minute. But it\u2019s this part that really strikes me: You start out writing crap and thinking it\u2019s good stuff. Creating anything is such a weird road. When you\u2019re writing fiction, you\u2019re creating a whole world (even if you\u2019re writing firmly-rooted-in-reality contemporary stories.) And it\u2019s impossible to do that if you don\u2019t foster some sense that you\u2019re doing good work. Some really smart, talented people have said that their first drafts suck. Like Octavia Butler up there. And also: Ernest Heminway\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. The first draft of anything is shit. Anne Lamott\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Almost all good writing begins with terrible first efforts. Joyce Carol Oates\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Getting a first draft done is like pushing a peanut with your nose across a very dirty floor. You get the idea. Even famous writers (even the MOST famous writers) believe that they start out writing crap\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. but underlying that sentiment is the idea that the crap is the basis for something good. Think for a minute about the audacity of that. Spending months, or even years, creating something that you A) know is crap in the beginning and B) you have to believe is good in its bones. Without any real evidence (unless you\u2019re Hemingway, I guess) that anyone else on Earth will ever want to read it. Because the only way to, as Butler suggests, gradually get better at it, is to do it\u200a\u2014\u200aand do it\u200a\u2014\u200aand do it until you actually do get better at it, persistence is of course a very valuable trait. So is a little arrogance, though. A spark of belief that what you\u2019re writing is good (even if it isn\u2019t), is really a necessity. Between working toward a bachelor\u2019s degree in creative writing and now being almost done with an MFA\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019ve been in a ton of writing workshops. It\u2019s common for writers in these things to say they hate their work. HATE. And every time I hear it, it makes me chuckle inside. Because I don\u2019t believe for a minute those writers hate their work. They love it. They believe it\u2019s good stuff. And so they should, because that\u2019s how to get better.

For tech startups, it\u2019s a million-dollar (and sometimes billion-dollar) question. If you want to expand your business, you generally have to spend money. But when does growth at all costs become a reckless strategy? How do you find the right balance between growth and burn? The tech world\u2019s last major reckoning with this question was back in March 2014, when Silicon Valley darling Box filed an S-1 indicating it was ready to IPO. For years, Box, which offers cloud-based content-management software to enterprises, had been growing at a fast clip. Investors were willing to overlook the massive amounts of money the company was losing, citing its long-term potential. But then something unexpected happened. The markets shifted. Investors hunkered down. Whispers went out that Box\u2019s \u201cunit economics\u201d weren\u2019t working. So the company waited nine long months before finally going public. The new attitude: Growth was important, but companies needed to be profitable (or show at least clear path to profitability), too. So what\u2019s the optimal ratio between these two fundamentals? Ultimately, the answer is still fairly subjective, but there\u2019s an insanely simple chart that can help you sort it out. There\u2019s no shortage of methods out there for assessing whether your startup has got the growth-profit balance just right\u200a\u2014\u200athe real question is what \u201cjust right\u201d actually means. The now-famous \u201cRule of 40,\u201d for example, suggests that a successful software-as-a-service (SaaS) startup\u2019s growth rate plus profit should add up to 40: If you\u2019re growing at 60% rate, you can afford to lose 20%, for instance. But I\u2019m a highly visual person and started to wonder whether there was a way to express this dynamic graphically. Thinking aboutHootsuite\u2018s own trajectory, I threw together this super-simple chart: Now, I realize this is far from scientific, and I also know the underlying concept isn\u2019t new or revolutionary\u200a\u2014\u200aeveryone from Boston Consulting Group to the venture capitalist Tomasz Tunguz have used graphs like this to assess businesses. It\u2019s very basic, but\u200a\u2014\u200aat a glance\u200a\u2014\u200ait should let you know if your company is headed in the right direction. Needless to say, the bottom-left quadrant here is the one you generally don\u2019t want to find yourself in. With few exceptions, you don\u2019t want your startup to be losing money and not really growing. That\u2019s a sure sign that you haven\u2019t mastered product-market fit yet. The top-left quadrant is where most promising startups start off. It\u2019s definitely where Hootsuite was in its early years. We were losing money, but for all the right reasons: burning through our investments in order to grow fast. In retrospect, this approach let us gain a huge early lead on our competitors in the social-relationship platform space. As we matured, our priorities shifted. Growth remained important, but investors and analysts became increasingly focused on seeing a path to profitability. So we reduced our spending, tightening belts and asking employees to do more with less. Last year, we achieved a cash-flow positive milestone. There\u2019s no doubt we\u2019re a healthier company now, one built to make money and built to last doing it. The idea of just \u201cbreaking even\u201d may not sound like a milestone, but if you look at similar-sized companies in our space, it\u2019s actually kind of revolutionary. We\u2019re an eight-year-old business, we\u2019re still growing at a great pace, but we\u2019re actually cash-positive. For most cloud companies\u200a\u2014\u200afrom Zendesk and Marketo to Hubspot and Shopify\u200a\u2014\u200athe idea of breaking even doesn\u2019t enter the picture until anywhere from two to four years after IPO. So when it comes to the growth-profit matrix, it\u2019s all about angling yourself into the right quadrant at the right time\u200a\u2014\u200aknowing it might not be in your best interest to try and stay put there forever. For many startups, this is easy to miss. If we were to think of these four types of growth-profit ratio as phases, on the other hand, stretched out chronologically, we might be setting ourselves up to fail. I hardly think of our high-growth days as over and done with. While it\u2019s not easy to achieve high profitability and high growth at the same time, there\u2019s one way to break into that elusive top-right quadrant of the chart (andback into it if you\u2019ve had to slow down and refocus for awhile): continuous innovation. By developing new product lines and finding new ways to bring real benefits to customers, it\u2019s possible to sustain high profits while also expanding market share. In our case, for example, we\u2019ve built new functionality into our core platform, including the ability to buy social media ads. And we\u2019re adding features that make our dashboard useful not just to marketers but to net new audiences\u200a\u2014\u200anamely, sales and customer service teams. All these steps align with our long-term goal\u2013one that\u2019s predicated on high growth and high profit\u200a\u2014\u200aof becoming a $10 billion company. The profit-growth question doesn\u2019t have easy answers. What\u2019s more, you can never stop asking it because the right answer might change according to circumstance. Depending on your industry and the stage of your company, \u201csuccess\u201d might mean a very different ratio than it does for a different startup in a different phase. Ultimately, every investor cares primarily about one thing: how much cash flow your company generates over its lifetime. You may not be profitable now, but there needs to be a clear route to profitability, ideally in your near future\u200a\u2014\u200ano matter how groundbreaking your business idea may be.

Dworkin\u2019s finding comes on the eve of a potentially explosive release of the secret criminal docket information about the Trump family\u2019s business partner in Trump SoHo, convicted felon Felix Sater. An exclusive interview on the website Homes Overseas asked Eric Trump about the business plan behind his family\u2019s luxury brand in early 2009, during the height of the American real estate crash and Great Recession. At the time, the Trump Organization was a mostly an American venture, but had begun to aggressively and very publicly spread its reach overseas just the year before and with the Trump Panama project. Here is Eric Trump\u2019s answer about the family\u2019s target buyers for its luxury real estate in an exclusive interview given to the Russian edition of HomesOverseas.ru: Eric Trump\u2019s above statement\u200a\u2014\u200alike many subsequent news reports\u200a\u2014\u200awholly debunks his father the President\u2019s many statements of denial about having significant Russian business ties. The Trump Organization went on a golf course buying spree after 2010 after most traditional avenues of financing those properties left the market post-crash, which he told a Golf Magazine reporter. The Homes Overseas interview with Eric Trump can be traced to early 2009 by reading EXIF data in the photos directly from the interview, as you can see in this image displaying the result. (story continues below) The following year\u200a\u2014\u200asoon after Eric Trump spoke about the lower Manhattan tower\u2019s reliance on Russian buyers in the above comments\u200a\u2014\u200aa series of lawsuits were filed involving the Trump SoHo Condominium Hotel\u2019s developers Bayrock, which ensnared Felix Sater. By then, Sater had outwardly left the Bayrock development firm to become the Trump Organization\u2019s senior advisor. But the racketeering lawsuit against Sater and Bayrock is still in the discovery phase in federal court, after he lost a motion to dismiss the case at the end of December 2016. Bayrock whistleblower Jody Kriss is one of the plaintiffs and told all about Trump\u2019s dirty deal to Bloomberg. Leaked emails showed how the entire Trump family could be liable for Sater\u2019s alleged acts of racketeering related to bank fraud. Shortly after President Trump\u2019s inauguration, reports emerged of Sater working to be a secret back-channel diplomat for the Administration\u200a\u2014\u200ahand carrying a Ukraine \u201cpeace plan\u201d aimed at dropping sanctions to the White House\u200a\u2014\u200aalong with Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Michael Cohen. A few months later, The Stern Facts showed that Felix Sater had advised the Trump Campaign. Late last year, the New York Times obtained an email from Sater, telling Cohen that he could get all of Putin\u2019s team behind the Trump Campaign which \u201cwill get Donald Trump elected.\u201d The Trump SoHo Hotel project\u200a\u2014\u200ahyped on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d for a multi-year period\u200a\u2014\u200afailed and went into foreclosure. But the Trump Organization continued to manage it and earn $3 million annually for keeping its flagging brand on the front door until bought out late last year. \u201cEric Trump has consistently admitted that his family business relies on Russian capital,\u201d says Dworkin, whose opposition research uncovered a series of Trump\u2019s Russian business ties long before Christopher Steele\u2019s explosive dossier was released last January. Dworkin concluded, \u201cThis confirms Eric has had Russian ties for at least a decade just like Ivanka, Don Jr., and Donald.\u201d By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

Based out of his garden shed, the Unlimited Space Agency started as a fun way to tell inspirational stories about science to children. It turns out that if you go around wearing a spacesuit and saying you\u2019re \u201cthe Director of Human Spaceflight Operations for the Unlimited Space Agency\u201d, more people than you might imagine want to join in and play along. What started as a dream ended up with British astronaut Tim Peake taking a 3D printed \u2018Mini Jon\u2019 with him\u200a\u2014\u200afulfilling Jon\u2019s lifelong ambition to go to space. Here are the Five Things Jon learned as he hacked his way into space\u2026 My mum always told us \u201cIf you don\u2019t ask, you don\u2019t get\u201d. It\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but through embarrassment, or shyness, or fear of rejection, most people don\u2019t. The worst thing that can happen is someone says \u2018No\u2019, and I\u2019m fine with that. When that happens, I figure I\u2019m just asking the wrong person, so I go and find the right one. My mum wasn\u2019t talking about being pushy or asking for things you didn\u2019t deserve or hadn\u2019t earned\u200a\u2014\u200awe\u2019re talking about basic stuff here. Asking for help, support, \u2018Can I have a lend of your 3D printer\u2019, and \u2018Maybe you could take me with you, to space?\u2019 My journey started by emailing a woman I\u2019d read about on the internet\u200a\u2014\u200aDr Gail Iles (or Dr. Awesome as she prefers to be called). Gail is a particle physicist, and at the time was an astronaut instructor with the European Space Agency. I wrote to her and asked if we could meet. She said yes, we went for lunch and have been friends ever since. That first time we met, I asked Gail if I might be able to visit the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne, where she worked. Y\u2019know, for research. She said she\u2019d see what she could do. A few days later she emailed inviting me to come out and train with her for three days as an astronaut, which was where I met Tim Peake for the first time. And that is, basically, how I ended up going to space. I just kept asking people to help me get there. Every single astronaut I\u2019ve met gives this as their primary piece of advice to anyone who wants to get into space. It\u2019s another clich\u00e9, but again, it\u2019s so true. Clayton Anderson made 14 unsuccessful applications to NASA before being accepted as an astronaut and flying on two Space Shuttle missions. Our patron Tim Peake gave this wonderful response to a 9 year old boy who\u2019d been told by his teacher that his dream of becoming an astronaut was unrealistic: We\u2019re taught from an early age that if you want to get on in life, you have to fit in\u200a\u2014\u200aspeak in a certain way, adapt your behaviour to the environment you\u2019re in and wear the right clothes. Nonsense. It turns out that if you wear a spacesuit wherever you go, people LOVE IT. It opens a lot more doors than it closes. I have been laughed at and ignored by quite a lot of people with well paid jobs, wearing chain store suits and working in the \u2018proper space industry\u2019. But not a single one of them has had a 3D printed model of themselves flown to the International Space Station. I think we all know who\u2019s winning here, right? You have to have a COOL space suit\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can\u2019t just Amazon Prime a \u2018Made in China\u2019 NASA knock off and expect anyone to think you\u2019re anything other than a kooky marathon runner raising money for charity. Which isn\u2019t a bad thing, of course, it\u2019s just not going to get you into space. If you want to get into space then you need seriously brilliant collaborators, designers, makers. You need care, thought, originality, extreme creativity, inspirational oddness. In short, if you want to get to space, you need artists. Which brings me to: OK, as an artist, I already knew this, but a lot of people are weirdly nervous about working with artists like me. Maybe it\u2019s the spacesuit thing. Regardless, working with artists can be hugely inspiring, and if the spacesuit thing is a problem for you, you should totally get over it. Like this guy did: In my first meeting with the UK Space Agency when I described the project I wanted to make with them, I was literally told \u201cI don\u2019t understand why we need artists to make this\u201d. After two years, with more than 12,000 missions completed by children across the UK and more signing up as Cadets every day, no one involved in the project is in any doubt about the value of the technical expertise and uniquely thoughtful contributions that artists bring to almost any project. Artists are used to making impossible things happen. They won\u2019t think your ideas are ridiculous. They invent new things every day. They get stuff done. If you aren\u2019t already, you should be working with artists. If you want to work with artists and need any recommendations, ask me! In the early days of the Unlimited Space Agency our Missions Operations Manager sat me down and explained that resources were scarce and so we couldn\u2019t afford a rocket to get me into space. Hammer blow. However! Being persistent, inspired by other astronauts to never give up and knowing a lot of extremely talented artists, we set to work on building an alternative space vehicle. Inspired by my writing shed at the bottom of my garden we designed, built and then launched The Space Shed! After multiple launch attempts at festival sites in summer 2017 (Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day!), we\u2019re now seeking partners for future launch attempts in 2018 and beyond.

This year, we\u2019ll be serving as media partners for SXSW\u2019s 24 Hour Hackathon. From Tuesday, March 13 through Wednesday, March 14, hackers will collaborate and compete in three media categories that span the rich universe of SXSW: Music, Film, and VR/AR. APPLY TO PARTICIPATE TODAY. The 5th annual SXSW Hackathon brings together hackers, creators, makers, and coders to converge to solve problems, create new tools, and push the boundaries of existing tech across entertainment media. SXSW registrants are invited to the Final presentations and Awards on March 14. Our esteemed judges are Tuhin Roy (Universal Music), Ryan Walsh (Floodgate), Tiffany Zhong (Gen Z Whisperer), Jay Zalowitz (Hacker Noon) Jeremy Gardner (AUSUM Ventures), Waco Hoover (XLIVE), Jeff Liebenson (Liebenson Law), David Silorski (Earmilk) and yours truly. Well I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m esteemed, I am truly excited to attend my first SXSW and see what music, film, and VR/AR MVPs these hackers will build. Will someone outdo the machine learning behind Spotify\u2019s Discover Weekly? Or find a simple way to remaster classic films? Or maybe one of the hackers could unlock tech\u2019s white elephant? Or even solve mobile visualizations? Who knows? But I believe great tech could start any day. Why not at SXSW\u2019s 24 Hour Hackathon? The winning teams will be awarded cash and sponsor prizes and the opportunity to join the 3-day SXSW Hackathon Incubator, working with a group of industry mentors to fine tune their projects from March 15\u201317. Participants are welcome to blog about what they built, how it works and why they built it on Hacker Noon. Mail us to publish. Also I am wondering, how will the brain function differently after working on something for 20+ hours straight? Looking forward to quite a day of interviewing people for Hacker Noon stories. If you\u2019d like to meet up, DM me. This event is sponsored by ConsenSys. Additional partners are Devpost (ship it) and Tiny House Coffee (stay caffeinated). Until next time, don\u2019t take the realities of the world for granted. Kind Regards, David Smooke P.S. Applications are still open for the 2018 SXSW Hackathon. P.P.S. Spots are limited.

Within one month, you\u2019ll have the experience that takes most people a decade to learn. For every day you keep going, thousands of others quit. Think of all the ground you\u2019re gaining on the competition, every single day. But most people simply won\u2019t bother to put in the practice and effort to become better. \u201cBloggers\u201d post a few random times a month. Would-be coaches might have a client every once in a while. Coders, programmers, and designers fool around with their software, but only when they need to. Most people don\u2019t consistently and fully apply themselves, which is why it takes them so long to reach mastery (if they ever do). Said author John Assaraf, most people are only \u201cinterested,\u201d but not actually committed. It\u2019s an important distinction; when you\u2019re interested, you\u2019ll do what\u2019s convenient. But if you\u2019re committed, you\u2019ll do whatever it takes. The truth is: Mastery only takes as long as you want it to take. One of my favorite movies is The King\u2019s Speech. I tear up every time I watch it. Colin Firth plays England\u2019s Prince Albert, a man stricken with a terrible speech impediment. \u201cDo you know any jokes?\u201d his speech therapist asks him. \u201cE\u2026e\u2026t-timing isn\u2019t my strong s-suit,\u201d he responds sarcastically. The reason I love this movie is because I relate to his profound embarrassment and frustration\u200a\u2014\u200aI had a terrible stammering problem of my own. I remember going to speech therapy classes in 3rd grade where I was the worst stutterer of the group. I was not someone you wanted to attempt a full conversation with. I still remember when bullies would mimic my stammer. I developed an intense hatred whenever someone responded, \u201cWhat?\u201d to something I stuttered out. The stutter eventually went away\u200a\u2014\u200amostly. After college, I needed a job, and I decided to conduct as many informational interviews with prominent professionals as possible. I wanted a referral from them\u200a\u2014\u200athat meant creating a great connection through high-quality conversation in a very short time. I shudder remembering my first few meetings. I still remember exactly how they would ask me to slow down when I spoke (I talked fast to spit my words out before I could stutter). Or how they\u2019d lean forward as I awkwardly mumbled a joke they couldn\u2019t hear. But I conducted nearly 30 interviews over the course of 8 months. I got better. I would scribble the phrase \u201cTALK SLOWER\u201d in my journal 50 times before each meeting. I would force myself not to mumble. The result? I became a very good conversationalist. I got lots of job offers. I even got my friends job offers. I gained mentors, referrals, key insights, and guidance on my career journey from professionals making six- and seven-figure incomes per year, advice most people would pay thousands for. I developed a level of mastery over my speech impediment over those 8 months that most people don\u2019t get in 5 years. Now, I\u2019m constantly told I have a great \u201cradio\u201d voice. I\u2019ve made money as a voice-over actor (as Lego Batman. Can\u2019t make that up.) One time, I was standing in line for a comedy show, and a stranger tapped my shoulder to tell me she loved how my voice sounded(!). One of my greatest weaknesses and embarrassments became one of my greatest strengths. I learned one main thing from this: Mastering a skill only takes as long as you want it to take. Daily engagement is the only way to become truly successful with a new skill. The day you stop practicing daily is the day you start to lose. This principle has helped me develop mastery and enabled intense growth in several other areas as well. Here\u2019s a personal example. I wanted to be a better basketball player. I\u2019m right handed; I was terribly clumsy with my left hand. So I began jogging to the park 4\u20135 times a week and dribbled the ball with my left hand 500 times a night (it took a long time\u200a\u2014\u200aI had to keep running after the ball after I\u2019d bounce it on my shoe or cramp and lose control). But after a month, I became incredibly skilled with my left hand. Only a month! Most nights when I got home, I would recount incredible plays I made with my left hand to my wife. 2 years on the high school basketball team and I was never this good. Here\u2019s another story. I had blogged inconsistently for 4 years. I would write sporadically in bursts of inspiration, then completely stop for months in discouragement of low views. After 54 months, I finally decided to become consistent. I started posting once every day for a month. I had no followers, I had nothing to lose. 3 weeks in, a big blog asked me to be a regular writer for them. A few weeks later, I wrote an article which gained tens of thousands of views (my previous record was 748 views). A month later, I made $700 from a single article. What! That momentum would get me on bigger and better sites. 6 months later, I had gained over 16,000 new subscribers (in addition to the whoppin\u2019 200 subscribers I had amassed in the past 4 years). I was republished in popular magazines. A book publisher asked me to write a book with them! If you can do it every day, you\u2019ll be enormously successful. Most people will wait far too long to develop a skill that could be mastered in months, or even weeks. How long will you wait? What\u2019s stopping you? Why do you keep making excuses? Remember: those who wait until they \u201cfeel\u201d like it don\u2019t ever really do that much. Achieving mastery isn\u2019t fun. One of my favorite basketball players growing up was Ray Allen. (He was the Steph Curry before Steph Curry). In a farewell letter to fans, he said how people used to describe his jump shot as \u201cGod-given.\u201d This annoyed him; he said that claiming it was \u201cGod-given\u201d took away from the thousands of hours of hard work and practice he spent perfecting and mastering it. Achieving anything worthwhile is going to suck. Whatever skill you want to master comes at a price. It takes time, perhaps thousands of hours. It takes full concentration. It might mean waking up early and studying late when you could have been out drinking with friends. The reason most people never pass the \u201capprentice\u201d phrase (see: wanna-be) is because they\u2019re not willing to put in the work. In fact, most people don\u2019t even believe they could become a master of anything. \u201cIt\u2019s lonely at the top,\u201d uber-successful entrepreneur Tim Ferriss once wrote. \u201c99% of people are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for \u2018realistic\u2019 goals, paradoxically making them the most competitive.\u201d Most people will not press through the difficult initial phases of mastery. Mastery has a price, and most people aren\u2019t willing to pay. But for those who do? Anything is possible. The fastest way to mastery isn\u2019t simply just doing it every day without actually learning. After all, a bad accountant can still be a bad accountant after 10 years. In fact, many are. It\u2019s true, quantity is the fastest way to quality, and you should try, experiment, fail, and learn. There\u2019s a reason Seth Godin once said, \u201cIf I fail more than you, I win.\u201d But you\u2019re wasting your time if you\u2019re not actually learning. Many people are hundreds of hours into their \u201c10,000\u201d hours (a myth now debunked) without anything to show for it. A dozen hours of their practice equals one hour of a true learner\u2019s. The quality of your practice and training is far more important than the quantity of hours. One of the fathers of the principle of \u201cdeliberate practice\u201d was Anders Ericsson. In his book Peak, he writes: \u201cIt is better to train at 100% effort for less time than 70% effort for a longer period.\u201d This is why so many people languish in mediocrity, despite intense efforts to get out. Their environment sets them up for failure. If you waste all your time and energy all week, you\u2019re very unlikely to have much left to spare over the weekend, or after work. Most people will take far too long to become a master of their trade, if they ever do at all. Repetition and hard work is tedious. Failure, frustration, and very few immediate results turn most people off. But this is exactly when they need to continue. The individual who is able to press through those initial few days builds powerful momentum. Once they get going, there\u2019s no telling how much they\u2019ll achieve. Mastery only takes as long as you want it to. Time is relative; what takes most people a year can usually be done in a few months. How much you improve and how fast you progress is totally up to you.

The more you prepare ahead of time, and get clear on exactly what it is you want, need, or should do, the easier and faster you will move once you start. The reason why so many people struggle with \u201cbeing productive\u201d is because they skip this step, and when they sit down, they expect to start flying even though they haven\u2019t even decided where it is they want to fly to. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to realize that every time your phone buzzes, your e-mail pops up on your screen, your office door opens, your train of thought is ruined. We like to believe we can both participate in a group chat via text and write our best-selling novel, but the truth is, we can\u2019t\u200a\u2014\u200aand to think we can is wishful and naive. It\u2019s why people retreat and take vacations away from the busyness of life\u200a\u2014\u200ato distance themselves from distraction. The hardest part about \u201cproductivity\u201d is that we want it to exist on a static playing field. We want there to be one formal definition for \u201cbeing productive\u201d and we want that definition to mean we got from point A to point B. But, depending on what you\u2019re working on, sometimes you have to take the scenic route. Sometimes the most productive thing you could possibly do right now is to brainstorm a million random ideas, play with a few of them, watch them fail before your eyes, and then come to a more refined conclusion of what it is you\u2019re actually trying to build or \u201cget done.\u201d In many cases, people would see this as an afternoon failure. But on the contrary, it is necessary in order to better understand whatever it is you\u2019re doing. Don\u2019t fight yourself when that happens. \u201cIf you can\u2019t measure it, don\u2019t do it.\u201d This is something my own mentors have gone to great lengths to teach me, and rightfully so. If you can\u2019t measure it, you don\u2019t know how to improve it\u200a\u2014\u200aor worse, you spend too much time on the \u201cscenic road\u201d and you never actually reach a point of conclusion. Measurement doesn\u2019t always have to do with time, or money, or something tangible. Sometimes, the best way to measure is to simply look back at old pieces of work and see how and where you\u2019ve improved stylistically. But be conscious of measurement, so that you can tweak as you go along and see where you can become more efficient. For the longest time, I never wanted to share or talk about anything I was working on. I thought it was \u201cbad luck\u201d or would take me out of my flow. And I\u2019ll admit, there are those moments when your ideas are best left to ruminate in your own head, but you should not be hesitant to share what you\u2019re working on. Feedback is extremely important, and a lot of time can be saved by a single conversation where someone points out, very clearly, something that isn\u2019t \u201cworking.\u201d It might not be easy to hear in the moment, but you will be thankful for it later. When we talk about productivity, we often think of ways to seclude ourselves in our bedroom or office, alone, in the dark, with only the light of our laptop to keep us illuminated. But sometimes that approach actually ends up netting a poor return on your time investment because you aren\u2019t getting outside feedback. Find ways to practice in public. Use the digital tools we have access to, like social media, to release test versions of whatever it is you\u2019re working on: Whether that\u2019s a book, an album, a startup, a comedy sketch, anything. Practicing in public gives you feedback, and feedback speeds up the learning and development process. Need we really explain the productivity benefits of a black coffee with an extra shot of espresso? To some, this would be a distraction, but I have always found light instrumental music in the background (Beethoven and Mozart, especially)to be quite the productivity booster. As long as it isn\u2019t filled with catchy melodies that take you out of the task at hand, music can be like that whirring fan in the background that acts as a subtle cue to your subconscious to stay on the task at hand. Again, being \u201cproductive\u201d does not necessarily mean sitting still for eight straight hours. You might be able to swing that for a day or two, but you are not a robot. You will burn out. Productivity is all about flow. It\u2019s about knowing your limits and being conscious of how to move within your own constraints. Maybe you need to take 10-minute breaks after every 50 minutes of focus. Or maybe you can work for four hours no problem, but then you need to take the afternoon before diving into another four-hour work session at night. Do what works for you, and you only. This isn\u2019t about being productive based on someone else\u2019s habits or way of doing things. This is about knowing yourself, and using your habits to your advantage. It is said the best musicians, athletes, innovators, etc., follow a daily routine that trains their subconscious to know when it is time to work and when it is time to relax. There is absolutely something to be said for always practicing at the same time, or always going to the gym at the same time, or always writing at the same time, every day. You train yourself to know, as soon as that hour strikes, to fall into that mode of focus required to do your best work. Trying to be productive when one day you are working in the morning, the next day you\u2019re working at night, the next day you\u2019re working in the middle of the day, it gets exhausting. Routine is extremely helpful, and inherently removes the distraction of adjustment to something \u201cnew.\u201d Consistency is what you\u2019re after.

After a decade of toiling at startups, including the better part of 5 years at one that I had co-founded, an M&A transaction had resulted in me accepting employment at Square along with several members of my team. For the first time, I was going to work at what startup types have derisively referred to as \u201cdumb big companies\u201d. I felt like a mole on behalf of my startup brethren because I knew nothing but that. Not \u201cunicorns\u201d or \u201cdecacorns\u201d or \u201cdonkeys\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ajust old school, high risk early stage startups. I repeatedly turned down opportunities at bigger companies simply because they were big, only to then watch them get 100 times as big and merrily mint millionaires in their wake. I watched this unfold over the decade with a cocktail of attitudes that included by turns stoicism, arrogance, pride, faith and naivete. With a level of conviction normally found amongst the pious and the cranks, I wore my startup bona fides like a tribal badge of honor. \u201cWe\u201d were risk takers and pioneers; \u201cthey\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athe people that joined Google in 2007 and then patted themselves on the back\u200a\u2014\u200awere simply smart, risk-averse followers without our courage. We were willing to crush the marshmallow test every day and incur pain for delayed gratification; they were gobbling up the damn things so quickly they were risking early onset diabetes. When we said we were doing a startup, we meant it; when they said they were doing \u201ca startup within a big company\u201d we admired their chutzpah for uttering oxymorons with a straight face. We steeped ourselves in the teachings of Ben Horowitz, Paul Graham, Fred Wilson and Steve Blank; they probably attended yet another mindless 30-person meeting. When one of our tribe joined FAANG, we sometimes called them a sellout. This essay offers the first five confessions that contrast the stories \u201cwe\u201d tell ourselves and the reality of the grass on the other side after 2+ years of observation. Since this is just one person\u2019s story, I make no claim to objective truth\u200a\u2014\u200abut what this \u201cstartup mole\u201d saw inside the \u201cdumb big company\u201d either validated or challenged some long-held assumptions. Access and visibility is surprisingly good: Before Square, I naively assumed that the scale and cultural dictates of a large company would result in an executive team ensconced in their ivory tower, fed curated information in well-manicured Powerpoints, sucked up to and bullshitted just the right amount by everyone. I also assumed that information and decisions from on high would be parceled out in neat spoonfuls that the hoi polloi could consume without exercising their brain too much. I was wrong on both counts. My boss (who is on the CEO\u2019s team) has a surprisingly wide range of organic interactions with ICs and managers of all seniority levels across Engineering, Product, Design and Account Management. She prods for details in presentations irrespective of who is in the room and is happy to take unvarnished feedback too. She reads just about everything put in front of her, most of which is produced by ICs in the org. She writes her own SQL queries for goodness sake. Similarly\u200a\u2014\u200aGokul, Square\u2019s Head of Caviar (also on the CEO\u2019s team) told me he doesn\u2019t have a fixed desk and simply hangs out in open spaces in the Caviar area meeting with people and working through problems. It\u2019s hard to be BS\u2019ed by the courtiers if anyone can walk up to you and give you the straight dope. And as far as Jack is concerned, he may be a celebrity outside the building but inside the company he is in the mix with the team at large, helping to set an example. I\u2019ve seen him get tough questions in large meetings and give answers with zero coats of sugar. I\u2019ve seen him wade screen by screen into a product experience and give good feedback. I\u2019ve repeatedly seen him push for more candor in presentations. If you\u2019ve worked at enough startups, you\u2019ve seen or heard of pointy-heads with far less at stake desperately trying to inflate their fragile egos while avoiding inconvenient information that could puncture it. You\u2019ve seen imperious founders and managers who are tough to talk to directly. You\u2019ve seen children masquerading as adults. It may have happened here in the past but I haven\u2019t seen it in 2+ years. Young startups, young public companies\u200a\u2014\u200adifferent investors, similar considerations: As a founder, I spent way too many brain cells trying to understand VC mentality. I learned early on the importance of storytelling to fundraising. I learned the ugly power of social proof\u200a\u2014\u200aherd mentality if you want to be unkind\u200a\u2014\u200aas a key element of a successful financing. I learned about the value of team as a key reason VC bets are placed. I assumed a lot of this was unique to early stage startups given the nascent markets, ideas that look stupid at birth yet go on to change the world in youth and given the uniquely clubby nature of Sand Hill Road. And then I watched the runup to Square\u2019s IPO 3 months after I joined and what institutional investors and analysts said about it before, during and after the IPO. I was shocked at some of the similarities. Most startup founders have screamed into the void as yet another investor didn\u2019t get the \u201cstory\u201d at all and sugar-coated their lack of conviction with an ask for \u201ctraction\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aif you\u2019ve got enough traction, who gives a shit about story? I was similarly shocked to see how Square\u2019s \u201cstory\u201d felt misunderstood before and even after the IPO. I cringed every time some talking head on teevee droned on about how Square was acquiring the \u201cworst\u201d kinds of customers. I couldn\u2019t believe the supposedly smart takes that stupidly identified everyone from Apple Pay to Amazon as looming competitors instead of a true sorting of complements and competitors. But I also watched with satisfaction as the company used \u201ctraction\u201d quarter after quarter to help explain the story and create conviction\u200a\u2014\u200aand I thought about the sweet vindication founders feel when their ugly duckling startup, rejected by everyone at $5M post, goes on to raise at $500M post. I also watched the team work hard over 2 years to tell a more compelling story that would communicate the essence of the business to the broadest audience of analysts, investors and press. I watched them learn and iterate on how to outline upcoming initiatives and showcase opportunities for patient, long-term investors\u200a\u2014\u200aall things founders of 2-person startups must also learn through the fundraising process. The disparity in perks is terrifying: My first day at Square, someone explained that there were several \u201cmicro\u201d kitchens on each floor. Micro, eh? Sounds like a glorified vending machine sitting next to a warmed-over pot of coffee in a tiny space, right? Nope. Several of the darn things are nearly the size of my first startup office, that one I was so proud to lease despite its uneven two-toned hardwood floors, prison-style single small window and gross gas station-style bathroom key on a hook. But I digress. These \u201cmicro\u201d kitchens, they serve Stumptown. A dozen Naturebox snacks. Every La Croix. And in a sign that the Office team wasn\u2019t satisfied with being excellent at their jobs and wanted to get into a dunking contest with themselves, at some point they even installed spa water stations. I did not realize that the arms race had made its way down from the true outliers like Google to the decacorns, unicorns and even the donkeys. In fact, the micro-kitchen is just one example of the quality of the office experience\u200a\u2014\u200ahair and makeup popup! Boba Wednesdays!\u200a\u2014\u200aand this in fact worries me. I worry for my post-Square career in the real world outside these fancy walls. I worry that just like humans have always turned luxuries into necessities, privileges into entitlements, I\u2019ve gone from appreciating the perks to needing the perks. Seven years ago, on a Friday night, I spent an hour breaking down boxes in the aforementioned prison-style office. We had no janitorial service so boxes needed to be broken down and taken to the dumpster. Exhausted mid-way through, I took a photo as a future reminder of the way we lived. Another time, our $20 plastic broom that we used to sweep the floors (we all took turns! Welcome to seed-stage!) broke in the handle. We taped it up, took a photo and kept on brooming. I kept the broom as a reminder for five years. Will I be able to live that way again in the future? Will I be able to hire people for my next startup with the kind of conviction I had then? I confess I don\u2019t know. What David doesn\u2019t know about Goliath: I remember getting the calls from investors and well-wishers on a day that was already rainy IRL\u200a\u2014\u200aone of our public company competitors had just launched a near-replica of our core value proposition. Mustering my standard chutzpah, I swatted away their concerns but the inside voice screamed \u201cOMG ARE WE SCREWED AND DO I HAVE TO GET A DAMN REAL JOB?\u201d all day. Having been at a place that\u2019s large by most startup measures, I know I\u2019ll have little fear next time. People say that startups die from suicide more often than murder. That may well be true but if you\u2019re a first-time founder you\u2019re naturally going to fear both. My advice, which I know will fall on deaf ears? Don\u2019t. Unless the large company is turning the battleship in toto and barreling down at you for real, there\u2019s little to fear. Why? This is obvious but not viscerally understood by many founders steeped in nothing but startup experience\u200a\u2014\u200abig companies have their own constraints. Despite the cool stock chart, there are never enough Engineers on the team. If there is available headcount, it\u2019s hard to fill at scale. Even if you solve both of these, you have to\u200a\u2014\u200acorrectly!\u200a\u2014\u200awork somewhat within the box of company strategy and existing customer base. And even if all of this magically aligns, your Engineers have to operate with fewer degrees of freedom than a startup with 5 Engineers. Your Product Managers have to coordinate dependencies with a far larger peer set. The intellectually lazy hypothesis that I\u2019ve heard tossed around is that big-company people are dumb or lazy or both. The honest answer, and I can say this after 2 years at a competent, well-run company\u200a\u2014\u200athere are exceptions but as a rule we just can\u2019t go as fast as a 10 person startup even if we have well over 10 people on the case. Truly moving at startup speed would necessitate changes in strategy and, sometimes, changes in culture. You can only do those every once in awhile. Waste: To say it directly\u200a\u2014\u200ayes, there is more waste compared to well-run startups. But it\u2019s not for the contrived reasons I always had in mind. I haven\u2019t (yet) seen anyone drawing a paycheck for hiding out in the basement with a Red Stapler. The waste, as it were, occurs because larger organizations trend towards specialization while scrappy startups trend towards generalization. This is, ahem, a generalization but bear with me for a moment. Most early stage startups are forced, both by virtue of cash and the types of people they attract organically, to create utility players\u200a\u2014\u200athe Product Manager will double up as Product Marketer and Demand Gen lead, the Rails Engineer will write a bunch of sub-optimal JavaScript to get features out the door. By contrast, larger companies\u200a\u2014\u200awhich as I said have their own constraints\u200a\u2014\u200awill tend to hire specialists both because of the way the planning and budgeting process works (e.g. budgets doled out hierarchically 1\u20132X per year) and because of the kinds of people it will organically attract (e.g. Engineers that want to make a career in Android and join because of company reputation in the Android community). Of course, there are people who will flex into responsibilities outside their day jobs just like at a startup but the rate is lower. So despite everyone\u2019s best intentions, this optimizes the system for resources it already has vs. the bracing clarity of having to figure out how to get things done when there are basically no resources at all. For example\u200a\u2014\u200aI work with 2 amazing Finance partners\u200a\u2014\u200athey\u2019re a blessing since I had no such help during my startup and frequently built Revenue forecasts (God help me) myself. With my new-found abundance, I get a ton of value\u200a\u2014\u200abut I confess that once in a while I\u2019ll review the results of a project they worked on at my request and think to myself\u200a\u2014\u200aI didn\u2019t truly, actually, desperately need this and could have done without. I\u2019m not trying to be a crappy steward of company time, of course, but just like overwhelming abundance of food causes obesity in people, so too does a tiny bit of abundance in this case cause a tiny amount of waste. But when that tiny amount of waste is multiplied across thousands of people and millions of hours, you wind up with a system that is high-functioning but has unavoidable waste in it. So, that\u2019s my list. It\u2019s not comprehensive\u200a\u2014\u200apolitics, culture and tools were left out so we can adhere to word count limits for smartphone-distracted brains. Nor is it objective. But it is my list and it comes from the heart. Where do I go from here? Just like every starry-eyed 22 year old learns to go from black-and-white to technicolor by the age of 35, I\u2019ve reconciled myself to the fact that the militancy of my youth was in fact naive. I\u2019ve reconciled myself to the fact that I may in fact work at other large companies in the future and that that need not be a matter of severe identity crisis. I still miss the sheer velocity, the occasional gut-wrench, the gallows humor and the foxhole feel of early stage startups. I hope I have a few more of those in my future too, this time with more perspective and, I daresay, more hard-won knowledge. In the meanwhile, I\u2019ll be working hard, sipping La Croix and thanking my lucky stars along the way. Disclaimer: Opinions my own, so too are errors.

He\u2019s currently a bit stuck, a bit dissatisfied. I\u2019m aware that our conversation is quite technical\u200a\u2014\u200athings that our respective computer science backgrounds have prepared us to talk about. Although, something else dawns on me\u200a\u2014\u200athe emotional energy being expended on the other end of the phone. He wouldn\u2019t have called late on a Friday with an urgency in his voice if this thing weren\u2019t holding him back from starting his weekend. As someone with a rigorous background in computer science and product management, I think of myself as analytical, perhaps to a fault. But recently, I\u2019ve come to understand that\u200a\u2014\u200ain addition to the analytical and technical experience I bring to my product management work\u200a\u2014\u200aempathy is a crucial component to my product\u2019s success, and to the success of my customers. We need better ways of thinking about\u200a\u2014\u200aand applying\u200a\u2014\u200aempathy, regardless of our discipline. Let\u2019s take a look at some elements of that conversation with Mr. Green that Friday evening. He says some things: He\u2019s right. As the PM of a B2B product, I am used to hearing about it being used in very different, flexible ways. After all, it\u2019s built to be configurable. But\u200a\u2014\u200aperhaps Mr. Green is saying something else, too\u200a\u2014\u200athat the product did not help him feel good, did not help him look good within his company. As a product manager, one of my goals is grant my users superpowers. And Mr. Green wasn\u2019t feeling too heroic right about now. This was my cue to listen more closely for ways to elevate his work, influence and impact. Most commonly, a customer shares one (or a small number) of specific pain points. They don\u2019t offer solutions\u200a\u2014\u200aand if they do\u200a\u2014\u200athe solutions are localized to their particular pain points. The value of such themes? They are pre-vetted, don\u2019t need further discovery or justification. You already know they will tremendously help your existing and\u200a\u2014\u200avery likely\u200a\u2014\u200ayour new customers. By 7: 00 PM, Mr. Green and I had talked each other off the cliff. He understood how to leverage the current workflow for his business, how to make it work. But he wasn\u2019t particularly happy about it. Why is that important? Because the best products are delightful, not just functional. There are many theories as to what ensures stickiness, aka keep your customers coming back\u200a\u2014\u200aintegrate into their ecosystem, build a moat around them etc. I\u2019d argue the funnest theory is\u200a\u2014\u200amake them want to. Mr. Green\u2019s comment was a sharp reminder of this point, and that there was more work to be done on the certification feature. (Personal Tangent\u200a\u2014\u200aI am an engineer by training. If you are familiar with the MBTI scale\u200a\u2014\u200aI am an INTJ. If you think the Zodiac signs hold valuable clues to personality\u200a\u2014\u200aI am a Scorpio. If you relate to any of these characterizations, and are unsure of the applicability of empathy to your personality style\u200a\u2014\u200athis one\u2019s for you.) Empathy is often considered a moral value\u200a\u2014\u200aand a perceived lack of it, a moral defect. Either you have it, or you don\u2019t. I find it more useful to think of it as a muscle, that\u200a\u2014\u200aprofessionally, anyway\u200a\u2014\u200acan be created and strengthened with focus and repetition. In a PM role, this muscle becomes vitally important in discovering how get, make, and keep customers delighted with the experience of using your product. There are many reasons we perceive things differently than others. Bias in research, communication styles, learning preferences (visual vs, verbal)\u200a\u2014\u200aetc. This is perhaps why we easily understand someone \u201cspeaking our language\u201d, and tend to dismiss others. After all, as PMs we also need to use judgement, right? We can\u2019t build it all! Data is very useful to uncover insights about users\u2019 current behavior.. However, it\u2019s less useful at telling us what users would do, if they had a new superpower. Data is one facet of insight\u200a\u2014\u200aothers could be: What will take your users to the next level? What\u2019s right for your company\u2019s values? What do the finances say? Remember that data is but one perspective; consider others. In the context of Product Management: Empathy is the drive to understand what a customer really wants, and unpack that understanding into what they really need. With an additional aspiration to delight. Read on for practical tips that a product manager, their teams, and their organization can leverage, to strengthen the empathy muscle. Work to hear what\u2019s not being explicitly being said. If you are a verbal and literal person, this is a bit more work, but very worthwhile. On Friday evening, Mr. Green offered up multiple clues into what would help him be more successful. I just had to very keenly listen to him. I\u2019ve found it useful to run through PM interview exercises. Even if you aren\u2019t looking for a new opportunity, check out \u201cPM interview articles\u201d that suggest exercises on developing design empathy. Particularly valuable are exercises that don\u2019t have anything to do with your professional life: The ideas expressed here are technology / tool agnostic. What that means is\u200a\u2014\u200ayou have to be willing to be flexible about the underlying technology, in service of user needs and market fit. Even Facebook rethinks its strategy more frequently than you may realize. Remember Mr. Green? He wasn\u2019t quite happy with what he had, but didn\u2019t quite know what he wanted. That\u2019s ok, and that\u2019s where prototyping comes into the picture. When you have found those broader themes, create a prototype of it, and check back in with him. Prototypes gives qualified users something to react to, and gives you valuable feedback. Here\u2019s one way to to that, from Intuit. Set up opportunities to, quite literally, watch people using your product. Transcribe that experience, and create personas based on it. (\u201cTim is a busy senior executive with two children, and wants to expand his impact and influence.\u201d ) Spend time getting to know Tim\u200a\u2014\u200aallowing for accurate inferential and intuitive leaps to what he wants. Share this experience, transcription, and persona with your internal teams, helping them increase their empathetic understanding. There\u2019s no substitute for a first-hand / fresh-eyed experience; however, a secondary experience, when immersive, comes close. Here\u2019s a case study of one way to do that, from HBR. When creating a new feature, consider running a Empathy Map workshop. This is a self-contained way to validate assumptions of success. In a way, it\u2019s a summation of all the concepts in this article: gathering qualified users, creating self-organizing personas, designing a user journey, getting early feedback\u200a\u2014\u200ait all comes together here. Here\u2019s a template to do just that. This does not replace your work of designing the new feature; however it dramatically supports it, and boosts the chances of a great market-fit. Consider introducing Key Performance Indicator (KPI) targets that specifically motivate and incentivize growth of empathetic processes, features, functions, and products. While he did not immediately get what he wanted (and who does?), he remains a loyal customer and an engaged advocate. Knowing that we heard & understood his business needs (and his own)\u200a\u2014\u200ahad gone a long way. Good deal for a Friday evening.

We had spent nearly all of 2016 revamping a core feature and we were excited about what we\u2019d built. But shortly after the release, our design director found a discussion thread on Designer News. The top commenter quoted the first two lines of our About page (which says the company was founded in 2006), then wrote: Ouch. After 12 years in business, I\u2019ve developed a fairly thick skin. I know how the internet works. Some people are kind, some are mean, and others are just blunt\u200a\u2014\u200alike that top post. Still, the comment bothered me. Our company predates all the competition, and we have 3.2 million users. I also know that we\u2019re not exactly popular in the startup world. JotForm is bootstrapped, and we\u2019ve never taken any outside investments. We don\u2019t hang with the cool kids. And chances are you\u2019ll never see us on the top of TechCrunch, announcing our latest funding round. But, if people thought the competition was better, could we change that perception? Our competitors are more popular in the startup world, but did that mean we should follow their lead? Because we launched in 2006, our users work in a diverse range of industries, including more \u201ctraditional\u201d fields such as non-profits, law, finance, accounting, and big corporations. If we indulged our FOMO and imitated the competition, our product might not work for those users. But, we operate in a hyper-competitive industry where even Google has stepped into the ring. That can be daunting. While it was tempting to panic and chase the trends, we ultimately decided to stay in our lane. We would take our time and innovate\u200a\u2014\u200aideally without alienating our customers in the process. It worked. Innovating on our own terms brought us over a million new signups throughout the last year. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned from listening to your customers instead of chasing the competition. Criticism can be good for business. It can inspire you to stretch and innovate. But once you come up with something new, you can\u2019t just impose it on current users out of the blue (even if all the \u201ccool kids\u201d are doing it). If you make sudden, un-requested changes, you risk losing customer trust and loyalty. That\u2019s a big deal. Instead of forcing change, it\u2019s important to: 1. Release new versions or major feature changes to a small test group. 2. Establish a clear way to measure user reactions. This could be a number, a behavior, or another metric that shows how customers really feel about the change. The team and I thought a lot about that discussion thread. After deciding not to mimic our rivals, we had a new mission: We started with three hack weeks. These are five-day sprints where designers, developers and other product groups focus exclusively on a single idea or problem. Our cross-functional product teams were told to unleash their creativity. To think big and broad and wild. After a fourth hack week, we had a promising new design. That prototype eventually became JotForm Cards, which we released today. But first, we started testing. When people signed up for a new account, 50% received the new forms and 50% got the old design. If these new users logged into their account or worked on forms within a month after signing up, we considered them an \u201cactive user.\u201d That was our success criteria. People who received the new card-style forms were 30% less likely to become active users. We were disappointed. We tried changing the colors, the default background, and key parts of the form design. We tried everything. The results were still dismal. We ran email surveys and gathered feedback from our site. Most people still preferred our traditional approach. We talked about it and came up with a new testing strategy: Apparently, showing 50% of our new users the new forms and the other 50% the old design didn\u2019t work. But instead of forcing change, what if we created one more user group and gave them the ability to choose? So we decided to split our new users into three categories: We ran this test for a month and expected the old design to win again. People who could choose their form style were 20% more likely to become active users. We dug into the data. A large percentage wanted our traditional forms, a smaller group wanted the new ones, and most people were even happier to have the choice. It was a big lesson for us\u200a\u2014\u200aand one that I\u2019ve had to re-learn several times in 12 years of running this company: As I mentioned earlier, many of our customers work in fields like law, non-profit, education, finance, and accounting\u200a\u2014\u200aand these users overwhelmingly preferred the classic design. If we\u2019d simply released our new design and forced it on users, it would have been a huge disaster. We would have lost customers and maybe even damaged our brand. We realized that flexibility matters. Our users need the ability to choose. Now, we have some customers who use both the classic and the new form styles, depending what they\u2019re working on. That makes the product better for them. And we wouldn\u2019t have realized this if we had blatantly copied our competitor\u2019s one-question-at-a-time style. Focusing on the customer, not the competition, also means taking a closer look at how you run your customer support division. Many companies think support teams exist solely to resolve tickets and answer tedious questions. Instead, customer support is a critical function, because it lives at the centre of product innovation. Your support team should be empowered to speak up, contribute to the innovation pipeline, and take the initiative to investigate customer issues, rather than robotically resolving one ticket after another. Lots of people have criticized Slack, for example, because they have five times more support reps than salespeople. But it took Slack just over a year to move from launch to a $1 billion valuation. It\u2019s now bigger than comparable startups with massive sales teams. We\u2019ve taken a similar approach. JotForm has no sales reps, but we have 35 customer support staff who work all over the world. They\u2019re available 24/7, 365 days a year, and the average response time is 1.5 hours. This is what it means to serve the customer, instead of chasing the competition. Here\u2019s another example. Technically advanced users often ask to edit our CSS. We\u2019ve empowered our support team to help improve the product, so they began to independently investigate these requests. We learned which customizations were helpful and updated the product accordingly. Without the support team\u2019s insights, we would have launched a big and unnecessarily complicated CSS editor. When you empower your customer support team, there\u2019s no limit to what you can learn from your customers. Together you can make the product so much better. A year after I read that comment thread, here\u2019s what we know: most people don\u2019t actually prefer our competitors or their product style. We know this because we have the data to support it. It\u2019s true that some people haven\u2019t heard of us, but we had almost a million new signups in 2017 alone, and our growth shows no signs of slowing. Our customer retention rate is strong. There are certainly haters and people who don\u2019t like our approach, and that\u2019s fine. We\u2019ve learned how to serve our loyal users. And for those who prize a fresh, design-savvy style, now we have a solution for them. We\u2019re trying. We\u2019re listening and learning\u200a\u2014\u200aall the time. Most importantly, our competition motivates us to be better. They inspire our team to work harder. Without opposing players and dissenting voices, we might not have stretched ourselves to innovate. The bottom line? There\u2019s room for everyone to raise the bar in this online world. As 2018 ramps up, here\u2019s something else I know: // Thanks for reading. .

And for most of us, the path to those things starts by setting a specific and actionable goal. At least, this is how I approached my life until recently. I would set goals for classes I took, for weights that I wanted to lift in the gym, and for clients I wanted in my business. What I\u2019m starting to realize, however, is that when it comes to actually getting things done and making progress in the areas that are important to you, there is a much better way to do things. It all comes down to the difference between goals and systems. Let me explain. What\u2019s the difference between goals and systems? Now for the really interesting question: For example, if you were a basketball coach and you ignored your goal to win a championship and focused only on what your team does at practice each day, would you still get results? I think you would. As an example, I just added up the total word count for the articles I\u2019ve written this year. (You can see them all here.) In the last 12 months, I\u2019ve written over 115,000 words. The typical book is about 50,000 to 60,000 words, so I have written enough to fill two books this year. All of this is such a surprise because I never set a goal for my writing. I didn\u2019t measure my progress in relation to some benchmark. I never set a word count goal for any particular article. I never said, \u201cI want to write two books this year.\u201d What I did focus on was writing one article every Monday and Thursday. And after sticking to that schedule for 11 months, the result was 115,000 words. I focused on my system and the process of doing the work. In the end, I enjoyed the same (or perhaps better) results. Let\u2019s talk about three more reasons why you should focus on systems instead of goals. When you\u2019re working toward a goal, you are essentially saying, \u201cI\u2019m not good enough yet, but I will be when I reach my goal.\u201d The problem with this mindset is that you\u2019re teaching yourself to always put happiness and success off until the next milestone is achieved. \u201cOnce I reach my goal, then I\u2019ll be happy. Once I achieve my goal, then I\u2019ll be successful.\u201d SOLUTION: Commit to a process, not a goal. Choosing a goal puts a huge burden on your shoulders. Can you imagine if I had made it my goal to write two books this year? Just writing that sentence stresses me out. But we do this to ourselves all the time. We place unnecessary stress on ourselves to lose weight or to succeed in business or to write a best-selling novel. Instead, you can keep things simple and reduce stress by focusing on the daily process and sticking to your schedule, rather than worrying about the big, life-changing goals. When you focus on the practice instead of the performance, you can enjoy the present moment and improve at the same time. You might think your goal will keep you motivated over the long-term, but that\u2019s not always true. Consider someone training for a half-marathon. Many people will work hard for months, but as soon as they finish the race, they stop training. Their goal was to finish the half-marathon and now that they have completed it, that goal is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This can create a type of \u201cyo-yo effect\u201d where people go back and forth from working on a goal to not working on one. This type of cycle makes it difficult to build upon your progress for the long-term. SOLUTION: Release the need for immediate results. I was training at the gym last week and I was doing my second-to-last set of clean and jerks. When I hit that rep, I felt a small twinge in my leg. It wasn\u2019t painful or an injury, just a sign of fatigue near the end of my workout. For a minute or two, I thought about doing my final set. Then, I reminded myself that I plan to do this for the rest of my life and decided to call it a day. In a situation like the one above, a goal-based mentality will tell you to finish the workout and reach your goal. After all, if you set a goal and you don\u2019t reach it, then you feel like a failure. But with a systems-based mentality, I had no trouble moving on. Systems-based thinking is never about hitting a particular number, it\u2019s about sticking to the process and not missing workouts. Of course, I know that if I never miss a workout, then I will lift bigger weights in the long-run. And that\u2019s why systems are more valuable than goals. Goals are about the short-term result. Systems are about the long-term process. In the end, process always wins. You can\u2019t predict the future. (I know, shocking.) But every time we set a goal, we try to do it. We try to plan out where we will be and when we will make it there. We try to predict how quickly we can make progress, even though we have no idea what circumstances or situations will arise along the way. SOLUTION: Build feedback loops. Each Friday, I spend 15 minutes filling out a small spreadsheet with the most critical metrics for my business. For example, in one column I calculate the conversion rate (the percentage of website visitors that join my free email newsletter each week). I rarely think about this number, but checking that column each week provides a feedback loop that tells me if I\u2019m doing things right.

Feedback loops are important for building good systems because they allow you to keep track of many different pieces without feeling the pressure to predict what is going to happen with everything. Forget about predicting the future and build a system that can signal when you need to make adjustments. None of this is to say that goals are useless. However, I\u2019ve found that goals are good for planning your progress and systems are good for actually making progress. Goals can provide direction and even push you forward in the short-term, but eventually a well-designed system will always win. Having a system is what matters. Committing to the process is what makes the difference. James Clear writes at JamesClear.com, where he shares self-improvement tips based on proven scientific research.

As it is these days, more and more entrepreneurs and investors concentrate on this industry, since the sports apps turned out to be the second fastest growing app category in the world. More often than to check our social media we use the smartphones to find out who won the sports game, which position our favorite teams are taking and how many points Sidney Crosby has scored while we were busy with dinner making. All the latest news, live-streams, hot statistics, hi-resolution photos of the games and schedules are there in sports apps, just at our fingertips. Despite the fact that almost every city and town has its enterprise sports complex, fans appreciation long ago shifted towards sports mobile games and sports news apps. As a proof, in 2016 Flurry analytics released an annual State of the Mobile report which already showed that sports apps became the second fastest growing mobile app category. It was sided by the first-place social and messaging apps and third-place business/finance category. According to this report, the general social and sports mobile apps usage has grown in 40 percent. The results were obtained by tracking approximately 940,000 apps across 2.1 billion gadgets with more than 3.2 trillion sessions. Comparing to this, the non-sport games, magazines, news and other personalization apps had a visible decline in usage numbers, up to 46 percent. As the report stated, Sports and Business/Finance that are heavily time-dependent categories will see the further growth. The customers around the globe continue to shift their daily habits and needs away from traditional TVs and banks to their mobile apps. To prove our point that the sports app development is flourishing, here is the review for the best sports apps out there that made their owners rich and fans\u200a\u2014\u200ahappy. The current leader in the market, formerly known as SportsCenter. Now, the ESPN app became a giant that users love to check for the hottest and latest sporting news, information on players worldwide, etc. It brings people updated scores, breaking alerts about teams and leagues, even professional analytics. The app offers fully customizable user profile, allowing you to personalize your own sports experience. It also has a spin-off app called WatchESPN that requires Cable/Telco subscription. Download for iOS, Android Second in the field but nevertheless an outstanding app. LiveScore is trusted with up to the minute scores since 1998, it\u2019s a reliable simple mobile app that does its job perfectly. Here you can find the latest news from the fields of hockey, basketball, soccer, and tennis. This sports app presents various league standings, all match information, and recent headlines. Download for iOS, Android This mobile app offers you personalized score updates, stats, hottest news and professional analytics for the favorite teams and leagues. It has live-streaming feature for huge events along with on-demand video highlights, original sports video programs and live broadcasts of CBS Sports Radio. Download for Android, iOS One of people\u2019s dearest, NHL application has everything a hockey fan desires to know about the live scores and player stats, latest news and information on favorite teams.

Download for iOS, Android People also love Thuuz Sports app and theScore Android and iOS versions. As you can see, sports apps present a great opportunity for an entrepreneur to profit. We already reviewed the top 10 reasons why any football, hockey or basketball team app is destined to be successful. So it\u2019s about time we describe some basics of the sports app development. The sports app design is pretty straightforward since you know your target audience well\u200a\u2014\u200athey\u2019re sports fans and they have particular daily demands for your software product. Now, the app is only as good as its valuable features. Below, we put up a quick list for you to keep in mind. The greatest pitfall, however, is that developing such application will be easy only for professional programmers who know how to code and design the app\u2019s UI and UX. So the first question that pops up to any startuper\u2019s mind is that how much money will it require to build the best sport app with mobile application development company. Let\u2019s find the right answer. Like with any other mobile app, the price depends on the complexity of features that would be implemented and the monetizing option that owner chooses for the application. Also, if there would be a live-streaming tool it will add to the price as well. Assuming you\u2019d like to start with an MVP for your app, that is supposed to be available in different countries worldwide when is done, we can name the approximate price. Based on our experience, a sports app\u2019s MVP would cost you somewhere between $30.000\u201335.000 per one platform (iOS or Android). Diving into the process a little deeper, other aspects you should know to start a development itself include the following: Team\u2019s size The most time-consuming features The overall development numbers For example, taking into account that the average hourly rate of Ukrainian developers is $35\u201340, the final cost of a sports app development would be around $44.000\u201380.000. But since the demand for sports apps on the market is very high, such investment would pay off in no time. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

There\u2019s a reason many state \u201cI\u2019m like a child and just learning\u201d, whilst endeavouring to deliver adult grade conversation within months or even weeks of birth. Even for a basic chat to work well requires balancing NLP with scripting, simplifying steps to complete tasks, capturing data in appropriate places and balancing the \u2018creep\u2019 factor of AI and big data. The field is rapidly evolving and the rules along with it, this article intends to give you some powerful guiding principles to get underway. A lot can go wrong (there\u2019s even a website just on chatbot fails!). Designers must take careful consideration of each conversation\u200a\u2014\u200aand we want to pick the most beneficial place to start to build, test, and learn from. But #1: which bit to build first? Conversations are complicated. They ramble and weave, change context randomly and cover many different aspects and topics. Replicating this in a machine is not an easy task\u200a\u2014\u200aone of the many reasons why AI has taken 70 years from the \u201cTuring test\u201d to reach this point. Conversational Ecosystem diagrams give you a high-level view of #allthethings your customers and employees need to chat about with your organisation. We created the conversational ecosystem to quickly get to a holistic view of a businesses conversational opportunities and how they relate to each other. Visualising conversation relationships enables you to make informed decisions on where you want to start designing your chatbot. They can also help you design the first conversation better, by understanding what it will need to link to or what other conversations people might need to have next. For example, let\u2019s say a travel Chatbot has the topic of booking plane tickets. The topics within that topic would simply be the methods of booking a ticket. For example, getting a recommendation from the bot or searching the bot for a specific destination. Once you have this mapped out, it is far easier to see potential linkages and value adds. But #2: conversation design shouldn\u2019t be rocket science! Ecosystem models are used in science to understand ecologies, so it\u2019s not rocket science! Designers have been using them across multiple industries to understand systems and scenarios. Architecture is often represented in this way too. Just as you need to design a house so that people can move between the rooms in a practical way\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can use ecosystem diagrams to help you design your conversations and content in this way too. But #3: why not just design the conversation steps straight away!? Your Chatbot/Conversational UX is another window into your business\u200a\u2014\u200aand people are going to ask it #allthethings. So without understanding how all the conversations fit together, you can\u2019t set yourself up for success from the beginning. \u201cUnderstand\u201d is the first step in the ever-popular and practical process of design thinking. Understanding how converations relate and link to each other with ecosystem thinking sets you up for long-term success. These diagrams empower you to choose; design the light touch (MVP) for each topic, focus on one specific area, or craft a specific path through. This enables you to more confidently design the first few conversations to grow into a fuller complete conversational UX. An alternative approach would be to do a customer journey map\u200a\u2014\u200adesign conversation steps or touch-points\u200a\u2014\u200awhilst a very useful aspect of the design process, this linear view doesn\u2019t give you that birds eye view confidence before diving into define and design the conversation details. But #4: I don\u2019t know what the key conversations are?! Here\u2019s some ways to identify your key conversation topics: Once you\u2019ve identified the key conversation topics/tasks, you can use Information Architecture design techniques to identify the key topic groups and their relationships\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as card sorting. But #5: I have very different types of customers!? Good news\u200a\u2014\u200aconversation UX designs can be adapted for the different personas/user profiles/customers/segments. It\u2019s easy to change the tone or tweak the content! Ambit\u2019s platform enables you to easily personalise conversations for your different types of customers/employees. For example purchasing conversations can be used for consumers and businesses\u200a\u2014\u200ajust change the product info, links and tweak the tone for your different audience. Visually representing conversations gives you a powerful way to get started designing and building your conversational user experience. Like any project\u200a\u2014\u200astart with the end in mind. Understanding your customers, what they want, and how they communicate with you is key to winning conversations. If you think of any \u201cif\u2019s and but\u2019s!?\u201d please ask away\u200a\u2014\u200aor get in touch.

Email sent to the leadership of Poynter (Journalism) Institute to counter this piece harvesting free image use \u201cThese Tools will help you find the right images for your story\u201d Dear Mr. Neil Brown I am writing to you because I am shocked, baffled and deeply disappointed by a piece posted on the Poynter site [https://www.poynter.org/\u2026/these-tools-will-help-you-find-ri\u2026]. For a prestigious organization like Poynter that represents journalists and photojournalists, I find the piece amateurish and also find it to be damaging to Poynter. Freelance photojournalists make up much of the workforce that provides work for publications. Freelance photographers carve out a modest living licensing (and re-licensing) images for editorial use. Same for wire services and other syndication services which depend on licensing as a significant revenue stream. Poynter should be advocating for all forms of paid content, that includes photographs. By doing so, you are also helping to map out paid image use on the Internet and protecting our industry for the next generation. Allow me to remind you, journalism has been in trouble because as an industry, we gave away content for free for the last 20 years with the advent of the internet, which, in its nascent years, was viewed as fledgling technology. Google and Facebook benefitted in the billions in ad revenues but publications less so. This ad shift was harmful to journalism. Publications have never been able to capture the online revenues or allowed some of that revenue to meaningfully flow to photographers. No industry survives by giving content away for free. We learned this lesson the hard way. Finally, publishers are getting smart and it appear we may just now be turning the corner in terms of educating the publics that they need to pay for quality content as shown by NYT\u2019s recent earnings and the rise of paywalls in this country. Similar logic applies to photography. Photographers create original visual content and they have to be paid for its use and re-licensing, in the same way NYT is able to get digital subscriptions; for photographers, there must be a proper licensing model for the internet. Promoting platforms that harvest images en mass but really benefit the platform by valuation, devastates our industry and drives talented and experienced photographers out of work. In an era of \u201cfake news\u201d and fake photos, a journalism institution such as Poynter, legitimizing sites where content is unvetted, and uploaded by anyone and everyone, is troubling on so many levels. It boggles the mind that no one thought about this crucial aspect of journalism!!! Some issues to address in the piece that I find are misleading:1) Images on Flickr are not for free. Many professionals use Flickr too to market their work Everyone should assume images on the internet are copyrighted. Unless it\u2019s your images, to assume it\u2019s free is an ignorant slippery and dangerous slope. Anyone making this mistake will be slammed with a copyright lawsuit and it cam be costly, potentially $150,000 per infringement. As an industry we should be encouraging licensing images, even for modest fees. 2) Unexplained, is that there are different tiers of licensing models in Creative Commons. It is confusing to the general public. Not all images are in the public domain. You do see copyright suits because of this confusion. 3) Many consider Unsplash to be basically a copyright grab site. You can read about here. An example of hoarding mass content, putting up predatory terms of use, and the platform seems to be the only enitity to benefit when it comes time to sell. https://pdnpulse.pdnonline.com/\u2026/new-low-photo-community-as\u2026 Image theft is so rampant, professional photographers have been copyright registering their work in bulk to protect their work from unauthorized use and misuse. It seems what Poynter needs someone like Ken Irby, someone who is knowledgeable and learned in the ways of photojournalism or who has worked more closely with NPPA onmissues that are concerning to staff and freelance photographers alike. The posting of this article\u200a\u2014\u200aand in fact, the mindset of its writers\u200a\u2014\u200ademonstrates how wide a chasm exists at Poytner without experienced and learned hands in professional photojournalism.

What if there were so many comments and questions you had to hire help to answer them all? That\u2019s the dream of every writer who wants to change the world. And it really can come true! All you have to do is a few simple things consistently. But first, let\u2019s look at what may be holding you back. And chances are, you may not even be aware you\u2019re making these mistakes. So step back for a minute. Take a look at your blog as if you were a visitor. Then you\u2019ll be able to answer these questions with a clear head. When I first decided I wanted to become a full-time, serious, change-the-world writer, I wanted to write about everything I knew. Sounds like a good strategy, right? Think of it this way. Back when I was young, my mother bought orange juice in these paper tubes filled with concentrate. To make it drinkable, she had to add the right amount of water, stir vigorously, and then voila!\u200a\u2014\u200ayou have a perfect gallon of orange juice. Imagine how that would have tasted if she decided to make 3 or 4 gallons of orange juice by cutting the orange block into pieces. It would taste like water with a hint of orange. I know they sell it in bottles like that now, but if you\u2019re expecting full-on orange juice, a hint just won\u2019t do, will it? The first barrier to an unforgettable blog is a lack of focus. It\u2019s better to go deep than wide when you want to change the world. Let\u2019s go back to the orange juice for a moment. What if my mom decided to make a half gallon from a gallon\u2019s worth of concentrate? That would be pretty thick. In fact, it would probably taste a bit like tar. You may have been told you need to be bold when you write. What a lot of writers do though is write stuff that either resembles orange water or orange sludge. You write orange water when you hold back, play it safe, and dare not offend. The result is boring writing no one reads. If on the other hand you\u2019re too bold, people will avoid you because nobody likes arrogant people. You choke on thick orange juice. You bristle at people who pressure you. You conveniently avoid coffee with friends who want to share \u201can excellent opportunity\u201d with you (and share no details until you agree to meet). The second barrier to an irresistible blog is the wrong amount of boldness. Don\u2019t worry. Soon you\u2019ll know exactly how to make the impact you want. Have you ever been to a party where someone goes on and on telling stories about themselves? They may seem like great conversationalists, but honestly, that stuff gets old pretty fast. You feel great at a party when you share stories with someone. You feel valued when the other person cares as much about you as he does himself. The best conversationalists remember we all have two ears and one mouth. I don\u2019t think that ratio is an accident. If you want to make an impact and write stuff that resonates with readers, make them the hero of your stories. They\u2019ll love you for that. The third barrier to an unforgettable blog is the blogger is too self-centered. Now that you know what may be standing in your way, it\u2019s time to do something about it. Are you ready to step outside your comfort zone so you can create content that builds a tribe of raving fans that will follow you wherever you go? Let\u2019s get started! Every summer we love to take a vacation. To make that happen, we have to decide where we\u2019ll go, when we\u2019ll go there, and what we\u2019ll do while we\u2019re there. If we leave it to chance, we\u2019ll never leave home. When you take a trip, you plan for it with a lot of detail. Your blog should be no different. You don\u2019t get in your car without knowing where you\u2019ll go. Why would you just write at random? The most successful companies know this. That\u2019s why they have clear, concise mission statements. Here are some examples: See what power you can pack into one sentence? Seth Godin does this with his blog posts. You can do it with your own mission. It can be as simple as filling in the blanks in this sentence: Here\u2019s mine: What\u2019s yours? Share it in the responses below. If you haven\u2019t already, write it down now. Then use it to direct everything you do on your blog. It\u2019s better to go deep into a topic than to spread yourself so thin you become invisible. The greatest leaders in history knew what they were about. We admire those who have strong convictions\u200a\u2014\u200aand aren\u2019t swayed by every wind of opinion that blows by. Will you have haters? Probably. Will people question your sanity? Maybe. Will people stand up and cheer because you\u2019re saying what they\u2019re thinking? Absolutely. It takes guts to take a stand. You need courage not to soften your stance so it\u2019s more acceptable. Real change happens when you confront people with the truth. Just don\u2019t kill them with it. Wrap your message in hope and people will be more willing to embrace it, use it, and share it. You\u2019ll go through temporary muscle aches if you can build a better body. You\u2019ll skip the sweets you love to have more energy to do what you love. You\u2019ll forgo eating out if you can invest in a fantastic lifestyle when you retire. Without hope, nobody does anything. You even take a stand because you hope it will make your life better. Invite people into what you hope for when you follow your convictions. If it\u2019s compelling to you, others will find it attractive. What do millions of Americans do every weekend? What streams into people homes via television, smartphones, and tablets? Stories. The blockbuster movie thrills people because it takes them on an adventure. If the story is dull, you\u2019d rather stay home, right? Be dramatic. Tell stories that invite people to see themselves in the hope you write about. Use metaphors to make what is mysterious easy to comprehend. College lectures have a bad reputation. When you go to college, the school administrators want you to get a well-rounded education. So you have to take classes you don\u2019t like to get credits you wouldn\u2019t otherwise need. The professors who teach these classes know that a majority of their students don\u2019t want to be there. So they hold back their genius and make the class a forgettable experience that resembles a yawning festival. What a shame. What if you made all your communication dramatic? What if you considered it a challenge to engage every reader who comes to your blog? Why let anyone visit and leave unchanged? Be passionate. Tell stories. Be a messenger of hope. Do that, and your message will reach far more than it misses. As creatives, we writers can be pretty sensitive people. Let\u2019s face it. At some point, even the toughest of us bleed when we\u2019re stabbed. So how do you deal with that, especially when I just told you to take a stand? Resolve right now that you won\u2019t back down when someone challenges you. Now you don\u2019t have to go after your haters like radio talk show hosts do. Don\u2019t call them stupid no matter how tempted you feel. If you engage with them at all, just use a few simple, magical words. Here are a few phrases that will diffuse even the most angry detractor you\u2019ll ever have. \u201cI see your point. And if I were you, I might think the same thing.\u201d \u201cYou raise a valid point.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a legitimate question.\u201d Why are these so magical? Because you aren\u2019t telling your hater she\u2019s wrong. In fact, you even appear to agree with them. And in a sense, you are. You\u2019re agreeing that they have a right to their opinion. But then, so do you. Don\u2019t surrender that right to anyone. Take a moment and acknowledge right now, \u201cWhen I take a stand, everyone won\u2019t agree with me. And that is perfectly okay.\u201d If you want to make an impact, stand on your convictions\u200a\u2014\u200aand plant a flag there. But also be humble enough to change when you\u2019re convinced you\u2019re wrong. When you have a platform, one of the easiest ways to engage with your readers is to ask them a question. It\u2019s also the easiest way to get the attention of an influencer. You don\u2019t know everything. Neither does the thought leader you admire so much. The great thing is you can help each other. And isn\u2019t that what great relationships are founded upon? One caveat: Ask open-ended questions. These are the kind that start conversations. When you talk back and forth with people, you learn, and you build trust. And trust is worth more than money. Why? Because when people trust you, they\u2019ll follow you, rave about you, and buy from you. Want to change the world? Get people to do something. Maybe you challenge them to write 500 words a day. Perhaps you create a forum where they help promote each other\u2019s books. Or maybe you create a checklist they can use to get their book written. Apply any or all of these to your own niche. When people take action on your suggestions, they get a taste of what you can do for them. So share the best of what you know, so no one gets the taste of sour grapes in their mouth. Be willing to help when people have questions. Even if they haven\u2019t given you money. That is the kind of generosity that can open doors to paying opportunities later. After all, everyone knows 250 other people. Someone in their network might be your next client. Throwing down a challenge can be as simple as asking your reader to do something at the end of a blog post. I challenge you to have a call to action every time you write. Do that and tell me what happened in the responses below. The best example of this is the \u201cfreebie\u201d you give in exchange for someone\u2019s email address. I hate the term \u201cfreebie\u201d. Give people a sample instead. While the word free is powerful, don\u2019t tie it to the value of what you\u2019re offering. Your work has some monetary value. What is your time worth? What about the information you just shared? If you give away a free eBook, tell people what it\u2019s worth\u200a\u2014\u200athen show people what they\u2019re saving by paying with an email address. What\u2019s really happening is you\u2019re trading value for value. You could purchase names with cash\u200a\u2014\u200aor you could give something of real value for the privilege of visiting someone\u2019s inbox. Here\u2019s another reason you want to think of your email magnet as a premium. When you give a sample, you whet someone\u2019s appetite. Make the taste so good, they can\u2019t help but want a plateful. If you do this every time you interact with someone, you\u2019ll become someone who is retained instead of someone people buy from once and forget afterward. When you make these 7 tips your regular practice, something marvelous will happen. People will stand up and take notice when you share your message. You\u2019ll get more calls to write a book, write a course, or provide coaching. And every time you show up, people will experience change and improvement.

I am inoculated against men like him. Most people, decent and good-hearted people, listen to Trump and their stomachs churn. I listen to Trump and hear only a death rattle. I know how men like him end. I already outlasted that kind of toxic masculinity. I had to survive my father, a small-time crook who played at having millions the same way Trump plays at having billions. I used to look up to my father. His name was Tom Bateman, and he was, for a time, as big as the whole world. He was built like a refrigerator. He was the man, the drake, the alpha. He was an ex-college football star and successful businessman who had all the answers. He flew planes, repossessed cars, and owned scores of firearms. Nobody screwed with him, nobody talked back to him, and nobody told him what to do. He was an irresistible force who won every fight, because he sucker-punched every foe. Then, in 1994, while attending a convention for auto dealers, he encountered a warm white light in his hotel room. The light suffused his body. A lilting female voice with a Welsh accent assured him he would never have to work again. When he got home, he assembled me, my mother, and my brother around the dinner table. \u201cI have to show you all something,\u201d he said, removing his t-shirt. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely awesome.\u201d There, on my father\u2019s bare left pec, was a tattoo of a wolf\u2019s head. He thumped his chest and pointed at me. \u201cI heard my mother\u2019s voice and felt her warmth. She told me I was free to be me. There are going to be big changes.\u201d \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you at the dealership right now?\u201d asked my mother. \u201cIt\u2019s two o\u2019clock in the afternoon.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m never working again,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s not an option. But I am going to grow the ponytails I was meant to have.\u201d He was true to his word: He stopped running his business, which he left in the care of my older brother, and proceeded to grow a series of ponytails, each of which he carefully snipped and sealed in a Ziploc bag. He then more or less vanished for two years, traveling through the Pacific Northwest, and only occasionally bothered to send us support. After he left my mother, he seduced various women and stole their money. My father started dating online in the early days of the Internet. I wrote his first Yahoo! Personals ad in 1996. I was 14 years old. It said that he had \u201carms you can get lost in and a gap-toothed smile as big as the whole world.\u201d While catfishing for sugar mamas on the World Wide Web, my father often mused about death. \u201cI\u2019m ready to meet my maker,\u201d he declared, adding that he \u201cdidn\u2019t care what happened to any of us. His explanation: \u201cDeath will be the happy end.\u201d But he kept on living, and grifting, for far longer than he or anyone else expected. Since he didn\u2019t work, my father had unlimited free time and Internet access. All of the women he lived with sprang for high-speed because he couldn\u2019t bear to wait while his favorite websites loaded. He used skiptracing services to locate his high school sweetheart, whom he had \u201cdumped like a hot potato\u201d the day he left for college. He used the Web to stay in touch with me after the two of them bought and furnished an expensive house\u200a\u2014\u200awith her money and several credit cards he opened in her name\u200a\u2014\u200anear Glacier National Park in Montana. And by staying in touch, I mean he would send me two or three dozen emails a day. Initially the emails were innocuous. When I neglected to contact him, he would write, \u201cYour fingers broke, Moses?\u201d But as he got older and closer to the end, the emails became longer and darker in tone. He spiraled into detail. He began exploring big themes, trying to impart what he believed were valuable moral lessons for me, a young man who was coming of age in a dangerous world. Between 2002 and his death in 2014, I received tens of thousands of emails from him, most of which I never opened. These emails were his legacy. They were scattered fragments of the world he had wanted to make for me. An email he sent me in 2013 serves as a kind of overarching manifesto. He wrote: Rambling non-apologies were sent one after another. He didn\u2019t believe in apologizing, \u201cbecause if you did it, you must have meant it.\u201d Yet he began to change his tone. He began to assure me that he had \u201cno regrets\u2026except all of them.\u201d And what did he have to regret? Sure, he had abused me and my mother. He beat us black and blue. He concocted a scheme that led to her indictment by a grand jury on charges of child abuse. The case made national headlines. I was called to testify against her, reciting outrageous claims that he had fabricated. I was 14 years old. He stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from those who were closest to him\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding us. Sometimes the scams were big and egregious, as when he chose to stay married to his dying first wife for seven years after he moved in with my mother, just to collect a bunch of term life insurance payouts.And sometimes they were pathetic, as when he convinced me to give him the $1,500 I had earned from my first job, ostensibly so that he could help me buy a computer. \u201cIt\u2019s for safekeeping,\u201d he claimed. \u201cI\u2019ll take better care of it than any bank, and you\u2019ll get what you wanted.\u201d Sure enough, I got the computer\u200a\u2014\u200aa crummy Gateway model used primarily for his online dating\u200a\u2014\u200aas well as a credit card bill for over $2,000. He had pocketed the money I gave him, used my social security number to secure financing for the computer, and then neglected to make a single payment. When I confronted him about having knowingly ruined my credit, he didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cYou got the computer, right? That\u2019s just life,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe do what we have to do to survive.\u201d He had done all these things, he assured me, because he had to. He had to because he was arrested on assault charges filed by my mother and he needed to regain the upper hand. He had to because he was under yet another audit by the IRS. He had to because somehow he hadn\u2019t paid taxes for 30 years. And he did it because he thought it would all work out in the end. \u201cI\u2019ll go to jail, but I sure as hell won\u2019t ever go to prison,\u201d he kept telling me. \u201cI\u2019m not felonious like the rest of my fucking family of fucking idiots.\u201d Once he wrote me this note, late at night: Here\u2019s the thing about these emails: They were gritty and unpleasant, but also filled with reveries. My father had an amazing imagination. \u201cIt\u2019s not true unless it\u2019s true for you,\u201d he\u2019d write me. He would insist that only you could be the judge of the goodness or badness of your own actions. In his later messages, he had developed all sorts of catchphrases and in-jokes. One of his favorites was: \u201cBetter to be subjective than subjugated.\u201d The father I had always known was a vicious thug. He was abusive, miserable, delusional. But the writer of these emails was someone searching for meaning. This writer had hated playing football and only did it because it was a simple way for him to impress everyone else. He also hated \u201cdoing jobs\u201d and \u201churting people,\u201d but did so because he was \u201calways chasing a buck\u201d and \u201cit was easy for a big guy to do.\u201d Even as this guy dispensed pearls of wisdom about \u201ckilling or being killed,\u201d he expressed dissatisfaction with his ruthlessness and bleak existence. What my father really wanted, deep down more than anything else, was to have had the life of Michael Crawford, right down to the Broadway performer\u2019s thick head of curly hair. Or maybe it was to dance like John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever. Or maybe to have a cooking show like Julia Child. In his wildest dreams, he wasn\u2019t some self-interested tough guy. He was a singer, a dancer, a chef. He could let his guard down. He didn\u2019t actually have to kill anybody, nor did he have to worry about being killed. Looking at it all now, I realize that the manly world my father had tried to make wasn\u2019t even a world he wanted to live in. But he was so desperate for something, anything, to call his own\u200a\u2014\u200aand he only saw one way. He couldn\u2019t fill the gaping void in anyone else\u2019s heart because a valve in his own heart was leaking. This is a man whose own father\u2019s last words to him from a hospice bed were: \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here, fat boy?\u201d He was blessed with bigness, but it was a big nothingness. He covered up this lack with a veneer of masculine aggression that almost killed me\u200a\u2014\u200aand following a series of heart attacks, finally killed him. He grasped for the words to explain this empty ache in one of his final missives to me: Like my father, Donald Trump is an awful businessman. They both boasted about having unlimited resources while living on borrowed credit. Both men bulked large and puffy in expensive power suits, wearing flashy watches with enormous faces that hugged their thick wrists. That time on their hands was money, and money talked, but neither ever had the time to talk about who they really were. These were scared men. They were empty vessels who covered their exposed tops with toupees. I know what terrifies people about Trump. They see his vast, overbearing maleness and believe he will go on forever. He is turning their hard-working middle-class grandfathers\u2019 America orange and he cannot be stopped. Or, even if he is stopped after the election, other men like him will feel empowered to snarl and rage for eternity. It doesn\u2019t matter if he loses and concedes. We fear that we will never be rid of him. But I am here to tell you that this isn\u2019t true. I am living proof. I have seen the final moments of men like him. Their endings are not triumphant, but sad, small, and cold. Nobody needs to stop Trump because, just like my father, he\u2019s destroying himself. By the very end, my father was 400 pounds of ponytailed, bearded weird, living on the Canadian border and using female shih tzus as pet mediums to commune with dead family members. \u201cYou have to use the female dogs to get through to the ghosts,\u201d he\u2019d tell me. \u201cThey conduct way more spirit energy.\u201d When I asked him what he had learned from these ghosts, he shrugged. \u201cNot a thing. They were 110% assholes when they were alive, and they\u2019re no different now. What do you expect?\u201d His expectations were modest, to be sure. He had been the college athlete, the small-time tough guy, the slick businessman. Now he was wearing adult diapers, pulling his own teeth, and sleeping on rubber sheets. He summed it up this way: \u201cLife\u2019s a joke and it was on ME.\u201d Trump doesn\u2019t ask for forgiveness. Neither did my father. But who needs it? An apology is just words. Death is an action. When I reflect on my father today, he\u2019s no larger than the wooden urn in my mother\u2019s garage that contains what\u2019s left of him. In his emails, he begged never to be stored there. But my mother still keeps his ashes because they remind her that he too was a victim of his own life\u200a\u2014\u200aof his crime, deception, and emotional abuse. He seemed huge, but he was a fraud, a liar, and a charlatan. And he couldn\u2019t escape himself. Some of Trump\u2019s fans have branded him the \u201cultimate alpha\u201d or \u201cthe last real man.\u201d My hunch is that they are right. Trump, his whole brand, that whole strain of toxic maleness out in the world\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s already finished.

Understand that getting even 100 followers on this platform is not the easiest task. Medium is not like Instagram or Twitter. I could easily get 150+ followers in a matter of hours on Instagram. To grow a Medium page it takes effort, quality, and persistence.This is what I learned from only 5 months using the platform. I\u2019m barely breaking ice on this platform, although I have learned a few techniques that might be helpful to you. These tips are going to a mixture of common sense with some practical methods you can start using today. Some of these tips may be common and others may be something you weren\u2019t aware of. I hope you learn at least one thing that will help you grow your Medium page. I mixed these 3 things into one tip because they are all based on spending time on the platform. You will not get any results on this site if you\u2019re here for 2 minutes to check your notifications and leave. Find a love for the platform. Believe me, it\u2019s an incredible tool that EVERY writer should be using to publish their work. I try and publish at least once every week. Be willing to write at least one article per week if you\u2019re truly looking to grow on here. The one thing that helped me in the very beginning was constantly going through other people\u2019s articles and giving feedback. I cover this method briefly in my article \u201cWhy You Should Be Everywhere On Medium\u201d.\u00a0The method is essentially going through hashtags of topics you are passionate about, finding some articles and reading them. Actually reading them too, none of that skimming bullsh*t and \u201cnice article\u201d on an article you didn\u2019t read. Remember, this isn\u2019t Instagram. Every other day I spend at least 30 minutes on Medium. No questions asked.Find what works with your daily schedule and make some time every day or every other day interacting with the community. This is a wonderful way to grab a little bit of attention when first getting started. Publications are huge. If you get featured in a publication with over 100k members following it, that\u2019s your article potentially in the eyes of 40k people or more. You should always be trying to make each article better than your last. You should be seeing what type of articles you like writing about and focus on those more. Cover a lot of topics when first getting started and see which one of those topics is your strong suit. Personally, I write about all around life improvement. That is what I\u2019m passionate about and what I enjoy writing about. My two most popular articles are about Medium and networking. Don\u2019t be afraid to diversify your writing. Start by following publications that seem interesting. See what type of material they post and if something you are writing about could fit within that publication. I\u2019ve heard of people emailing or messaging the publication owner. Personally, I haven\u2019t done that and I just kept working on publishing quality content. I don\u2019t think I got added to a single publication until my 6th or 7th article.\u00a0Focus on making over the top articles that are a must read. Use the proper hashtags as well. The publications will find you. The excellent thing about publications is the owner is trying to grow their publication by posting quality work, and you\u2019re trying to grow your page by doing the same thing. It\u2019s almost an equal trade-off. Sharing is caring, Right? I didn\u2019t see more than 50 claps on my articles until I finally got a publish in one of the biggest publications, The Startup. It not only got me a little bit of attention but also encouraged me to keep writing. Additionally, it made me feel like these words I am putting on the page are actually not that bad! #cheers. There are PLENTY of publications where the owners are constantly looking for less popular writers with gems that are worth publishing. Don\u2019t assume that you won\u2019t get published because you\u2019re not boasting 1k+ followers.\u00a0It all starts with writing wonderful content. focus on that before ANYTHING on this list. I didn\u2019t know the power of this until very recently. I once saw this tip in another article on Medium growth, but didn\u2019t really know it was an actual good tip until the other day when this happened. My comment on John Mashni\u2019s article \u201cYou Can Be Anything You Want, If You Do this\u201d has received more reads than most of my articles. I got 8 followers just from that comment alone. I believe when you go to the responses of that article, I am the top of the list. I had absolutely no idea this would happen when posting my comment. This highlights the reason why you should be frequently interacting with other people and giving feedback on their work. My term is \u201cBe Everywhere\u201d. I had no expectations that my comment would get over 200 reads. Seeing this happen made me realize that I should absolutely be doing this more often.Follow some top writers that get around 3k+ claps usual. Read their post and comment something meaningful on it. This is by far one of the most underutilized tools for growing a Medium page. Just do it. Don\u2019t be a coward. Honestly, though, I can\u2019t stress this enough. You should start bookmarking articles that you\u2019d like to reference right NOW. If you feel there\u2019s something about your article that can be related to someone else's, tag them. It won\u2019t hurt. Possibly, you liked a quote or sentence they used. Maybe, you want to back up one of your statements with something they said. Don\u2019t be afraid to tag other writers. Even popular ones. The worst that can happen is nothing (Ooo big deal). If you\u2019re lucky, they might stop by and see why you tagged them. Tag all kinds of writers. Tag all of Medium if you have to. Jk, don\u2019t do that! Example:In my article \u201cWhy You Should Be Everywhere On Medium\u201d I tagged the man himself, Tom Kuegler. Not only did Tom clap up my article, he shared it on one of his new articles. That potentially put my piece in front of 10k Medium members. *This article has since become my most read article* Thank you, Tom. Funny thing is, I actually planned to tag Tom on this article anyway because he has so many wonderful tips on growing your Medium blog. If you\u2019re looking to grow your followers on here, you should absolutely be following Tom Kuegler. This man went from 0 to 17k followers in a relatively quick time. While this is a less practical tip, patience is going to make or break your success on here. Your first articles will be unseen. I repeat, your first 10 articles may not get more than 5 claps. There is no such thing as publishing something and the little birdies flock in by the millions. Unless your Gary Vaynerchuk, of course. *Love you, Gary* You will eventually build an audience if you publish frequently, interact with other writers, tag other writers, comment on popular pieces, and most importantly just put in the work. Putting in the work is what most people can\u2019t do. If you want to separate yourself from 90% of other writers on here, put in the damn work. There is no overnight Medium success. Having followers is not very important. It does help and you should absolutely focus on getting more followers every day. I think what matters most is how many claps and responses you get on your articles. In a non-rude way, I\u2019ve seen people with 20x more followers than me get less attention on their articles. This is purely an example of why followers don\u2019t mean a whole lot. Another thing to note, while this article has been mostly about growing on Medium, I\u2019d like to remind you that pure passion for being a part of this community is where it all begins. Provide value, put in the work, write a little every day, be on Medium a little every day and be patient and consistent. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

Le Guin quite by accident\u200a\u2014\u200aon the library shelf, but not in the science fiction section. I was browsing the literary journals, which were stood up like little jewels in the entranceway of the library at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon. I had been sent to that section of the library by my speech coach\u200a\u2014\u200asent to find a suitably thought-provoking and emotionally stimulating passage, with less than 50 percent dialogue, that I could read aloud without rushing in less than 8 minutes. My task was to find a piece suitable for entering in competition in the Prose category, which demands of its high school competitors that they be \u201ca master storyteller, drawing the audience in with a well-cut and interesting piece, energy and variety in vocal inflection, and the ability to engross the listener in what is being read.\u201d I was not sure at all that I was any such thing, and I had no idea what I wanted to say or do. But I had propelled my 16-year-old self into this moment nonetheless, and was now spending a week of my summer vacation among the stacks of a college library, looking for a piece that I could \u201cconnect with in some way on a personal level\u201d and that \u201cflattered\u201d me and my abilities, as the guidelines for Prose suggested. It was a volume of the short-lived literary book series Left Bank that I ultimately picked up\u200a\u2014\u200aVol. 2, circa 1992, featuring Le Guin\u2019s essay \u201cIntroducing Myself.\u201d \u201cI am a man,\u201d she begins, and goes on to spin a sardonic fable rich with wordplay, arguing, with dripping sarcasm, that \u201cman\u201d is what she must be\u200a\u2014\u200asince to be a person, one must, it seems, be a man. That first sentence shocked me with its daring. I read the whole thing through, my heart beating faster with each new paragraph, and when I got done I walked it straight over to the copy machine and ran off two copies and rushed back to my speech coach as fast as I could go. \u201cWe have been told that there is only one kind of people and they are men,\u201d Le Guin writes. \u201cAnd I think it is very important that we all believe that. It certainly is important to the men.\u201d Le Guin skewers all things stereotypically masculine with dismissive wit (\u201cI can\u2019t write my name with pee in the snow\u201d) while also hinting at the toxicity of masculinity (\u201cI can\u2019t shoot my wife and children and some neighbors and then myself\u201d) in her litany of why she is not a \u201cfirst-rate man,\u201d but rather \u201ca very poor imitation or substitute man.\u201d She touches on issues of body image when she laments that she looks \u201clike a hen in a pillowcase\u201d when trying to wear \u201cthose trendy army surplus clothes with ammunition pockets from the Banana Republic Company catalogues,\u201d and manages to capture self-deprecation and mockery in the same breath. Her writing is at once abundant, rich with metaphors, jokes, plays on words and knowing cross-references, while also being singularly focused, every word pushing her narrative forward with stunningly well-crafted focus. All of this struck my 16-year-old self on two equally resonant wavelengths: First, there was an intake of breath at the thought that this was what writing could be: this sort of knowing, joking wit that was also deeply confessional and intimate. And second, a deeper realization that this is what being a woman could be: someone at once wise and self-questioning, seeking understanding and answers, unfeminine but not masculine, unflinchingly intellectual. In her 2004 anthology of non-fiction writing \u201cThe Wave in the Mind,\u201d Le Guin introduces \u201cIntroducing Myself\u201d simply as \u201ca performance piece, performed a couple of times.\u201d I can only imagine what it would have been like to see her perform it. I know that when I stood up in front of the judges in my high school speech competitions, opened my little black book, and read those opening words, \u201cI am a man,\u201d I felt wise, powerful and a little bit wicked. My speech coach loved the piece, and I loved it, deeply. Together we paired it with passages from \u201cFascinating Womanhood,\u201d a 1960s self-help book for women that seemed to capture everything retrograde about midcentury attitudes toward women, sex, marriage and domestic life. In performances, I switched between my two \u201ccharacters\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ahunched over, smirking, one eyebrow raised as I growled out the opening lines; then upright, prim, bright-eyed as I doled out saccharine advice on being a happy housewife. I didn\u2019t become a champion of the Oregon high school forensics circuit with my piece, but I did win one of the only trophies of my entire life with it. The judges praised me for originality, for a piece that was provocative and had a point of view. I was just happy to be spending so much time with Le Guin, to have the chance to embody something of that wise, powerful and slightly wicked spirit. Le Guin\u2019s words have echoed in my mind throughout the decades since I first read this deeply felt and even more deeply thought gem of an essay. On first reading, what struck me was Le Guin\u2019s sense of resignation, of confession, of having worked for too long in service of an impossible goal\u200a\u2014\u200ato live in a man\u2019s world. \u201cI look back on all my strenuous effort because I really did try, I tried hard to be man, to be a good man, and I see how I failed at that,\u201d she writes. I am not sure how I knew, even at 16, that I would become a woman who, like Le Guin, owns three bras and feels that she is shaped wrong and is not as tough as she ought to be. A woman who sheepishly tweaks out the nine or 10 hairs that grow on her chin. A woman who can\u2019t seem to find the right foothold among the available options of masculine and feminine\u200a\u2014\u200awho feels, as Le Guin wrote, that \u201cif I had any real self-respect, wouldn\u2019t I at least have had a facelift or some liposuction?\u201d As I have aged, my relationship to the feminine has remained complex. I think of Le Guin often when I look in the mirror at my messy brows or contemplate my unshaven legs. I feel vaguely urged to do something about these less-than-feminine aspects of myself. But, like Le Guin, I do not. It does not seem to be part of who I am now, any more than it was when I was 16, and shocked the freshman in my art class, who would run up, giggling, in packs, and ask, \u201cCan we see your hairy legs?\u201d I fear that I may have taken too seriously Le Guin\u2019s cynical suggestion of equating femininity with non-personhood and have, like her, ended up on a sort of third road of being some sort of \u201cpoor imitation or substitute man.\u201d But as my 40th birthday approaches, I have found myself coming back, not to Le Guin\u2019s electric opening line, but to her wry ending salvo, in which she threatens, at age 60, to \u201cgive the whole thing up\u201d and \u201cstart pretending to be an old woman.\u201d \u201cI am not sure that anybody has invented old women yet,\u201d she writes, \u201cbut it might be worth trying.\u201d Several years ago my mother, who is older now than Le Guin was at the time she wrote \u201cIntroducing Myself,\u201d confided in me about aging. \u201cThe great thing,\u201d she said, \u201cis that I just don\u2019t have to give a fuck anymore.\u201d Like my mother, and Le Guin, I am learning how to be what I am\u200a\u2014\u200astill learning from Le Guin these many years later. Learning how to not give a fuck anymore. Learning to give the whole thing up and invent something new. May we all face our own futures with a fraction of Ursula K.

Having lost everything and with not much else to do, Zeno wandered into a bookshop and was quickly absorbed by the teachings of Socrates. After studying with the great philosophers of his time, he decided to impart his wisdom to anyone who would care to listen. Thus the philosophy of Stoicism was born. Zeno\u2019s teachings would quickly spread and would be adopted by both slaves and kings alike. As he would later joke: \u201cI made a prosperous voyage when I suffered shipwreck.\u201d But that\u2019s not where the story of Stoicism ends. Centuries later, the philosophy remains as relevant\u200a\u2014\u200aif not more so\u200a\u2014\u200ain modern society. These stoic practices will help bring calm to the chaos we face today. Much of what happens in life is not within our control. The Stoics recognised this undeniable truth, and focused instead on what they could do. Born a slave, it would seem that Epictetus had no reason to believe he could control anything. He was permanently crippled from a broken leg given to him by his master. Epictetus would live and die in poverty. But that wasn\u2019t what Epictetus thought. He would say that even while his property and even his body was not within his control, his opinions, desires, and aversions still remained his. That was something that he owned. It\u2019s easy to get frustrated today. We\u2019re so used to comfort that even the slightest inconvenience provokes outrage within us. If the internet takes a second longer than it should or if traffic stalls for a minute, the natural instinct is annoyance if not rage. It isn\u2019t any of these breakdowns that are making us unhappy. The unhappiness stems from the emotional response that we have chosen. The onus is on ourselves to ensure that we don\u2019t let external events affect our internal state of mind. Once we internalise that, it becomes clear that we have the power to be happy regardless of our circumstances. The Stoics understood that time is our greatest asset. Unlike any of our material possessions, once lost, time can never be regained. We must therefore strive to waste as little of it as possible. Those who squander this scarce resource on minutia or entertainment will find that they have nothing to show for it in the end. The habit of procrastination and putting things off will come back to haunt us. Tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed. On the other hand, those who give away their time freely to others will also find that they are no better than those who waste it. Most of us allow people and other obligations to impose on our time too easily. We make commitments without giving deep thought to what it entails. Calendars and schedules were meant to help us. We should not become a slave to them. Regardless of which end of the spectrum we fall into, time is of the essence. We think we have a lot of time, but we really don\u2019t. Much of what we do stems from our primal need to be liked and accepted by others. Disapproval from our social group had serious repercussions in the past. It would have likely meant exile and eventually death in the wilderness. That\u2019s still true to some extent today. But how much time and effort do we spend trying to win the approval of others? What is it costing us? We spend money we don\u2019t have, to buy fancy things we don\u2019t need, in order to impress someone we don\u2019t care about. Our choice of career or lifestyle is centred around how others perceive us, rather than what is best for us. We are held hostage and pay a king\u2019s ransom every day, with no guarantee that we will ever be free. In contrast, the Roman statesman Cato sought to lead a life that was independent of the opinion of others. He would wear the most outlandish of outfits and walk in the streets without putting on shoes. It was his way of accustoming himself to be ashamed only of what deserves shame, and to despise all other sorts of disgrace. That was the only way in which he could stand up to Julius Caesar, whom he recognised was consolidating too much power. It enabled him to make the big decisions when it counted, without fear of disapproval. We have much to learn from him. Far better for us to live life on our own terms and ignore the opinions of others. Happiness should never be outsourced. Modern-day capitalism has given us an abundance of options. Whether it\u2019s food, travel, or entertainment, we have far more to work with than our predecessors did. Yet, this hasn\u2019t clearly benefited us. When presented with so many options, we become paralysed by indecision. This is known as the paradox of choice. Our brains haven\u2019t been able to keep up with modern day advances and are overwhelmed when presented with so much information. Because it\u2019s so difficult to make a choice, the default choice is to maintain the status quo. It\u2019s one of the core problems we face in our daily lives. With so many options, we never really commit to a path. We either put off making a decision or pursue multiple activities all at once. The result is that we never really make headway into anything at all. The Stoics emphasised the need for purposeful action. We must take care not to be merely reacting to our circumstances, but to live intentionally. One of Epictetus\u2019 biggest frustrations as a teacher was how his students claimed to be want to be taught, but secretly believed that they knew everything. It\u2019s a pain all teachers know and most of us would recognise. At the heart of it is ego and arrogance. The thought is that we\u2019ve learnt enough and are better than our contemporaries. Nowhere is such thinking more dangerous than today. The information of today is not only insufficient for solving the problems of tomorrow but can very well be the obstacle for sharper thinking as well.We are in an age where we\u2019re merely one step away from being disrupted in virtually every industry. Even in ancient times Marcus Aurelius has remarked, \u201cthe universe is change, life is an opinion\u201d. This is why the most brilliant minds of today spend a good portion of their time reading. They understand that there is always wisdom to be gleaned, whether from the past, present, or future. We would be wise to do the same. Always stay a student. Of the many things we can do daily, none are as important as looking inward. The act of self-reflection forces us to question ourselves and examine our own assumptions of the world. It\u2019s how the answers to some of the world\u2019s biggest questions have surfaced. Keeping a journal remains one of the most effective ways for mindfulness. It boosts creativity, increases gratitude, and serves as therapy all at once. The benefits are numerous. Your thoughts and feelings become clearer in writing than in your mind. The Stoics were well aware of that. The most powerful man in the Roman empire, Marcus Aurelius would dutifully take the time to record his observations and feelings whether at war or in peace. It\u2019s what we know today as Meditations. While everyone from athletes to entrepreneurs benefit from Marcus Aurelius\u2019 wisdom today, it is clear that the biggest beneficiary of his writing and thinking was himself. The clarity of thought and accountability brought by his journal kept him virtuous when anyone in his position would have likely erred and become a tyrant. Take the time to journal. It\u2019s not difficult and the rewards are immense. In a profession that is often based on compromise, Cato was stubborn and steadfast in his beliefs. He was taught that there were no shades of grey. All virtues were one and the same virtue, all vices the same vice. It seems like an unreasonably high standard. It\u2019s undeniable that many feats have only been made possible through compromise. Yet it seems that the pendulum has swung too far today: we forgo our principles in the name of tolerance or for profit. Cato infuriated both his political allies and enemies for his sheer refusal to compromise. He demanded that his friends and family adopt the same stance, without leaving room for any flexibility. But adherence to this impossible standard also earned him unshakable authority. By default, he became Rome\u2019s moral arbiter of right and wrong. We can\u2019t all be like him, but there is a lesson to be learnt. If you stand for nothing, you\u2019ll fall for everything. Much has been said about the power of positive thinking in recent times. We are taught that optimism and affirmations are the key to leading a happier life. But that\u2019s not what the Stoics believed. They felt that this practice invited passivity into our daily lives. It encourages us to simply hope for things to get better instead of taking concrete action. Rather than deny the harsh realities of life, they decided to embrace it. They regularly conducted an exercise known as premeditatio malorum, which translates to a premeditation of evils. The goal was to imagine the worst events that could possibly happen to them. For some, it was a loss of reputation. To others, it was financial ruin and poverty. But common to all was the eventuality of death. What would things look like if everything went wrong tomorrow? How would I cope with that situation? Should this change the way I live today? These were some of the questions they asked themselves. The exercise never failed to yield valuable rewards. The Stoics took cautionary measures to ensure that the undesirable outcome would not eventuate. Even when it failed, they lived better for they had contemplated how they would weather the adversity they were faced with. We should be brutally honest with ourselves and never be afraid to confront reality. That is the best way we can prepare for success and be ready for failure. In the grand scheme of things, none of what we\u2019ve achieved matters. It\u2019s a sobering thought. We all experience the world like we are at the centre of reality. That creates an illusion where our importance is inflated. We see ourselves as the protagonist in our own story. But the truth is this perception exists only in our minds. Everyone around us walks around with a similar mindset, but each of us are insignificant in the long run. Even the brightest minds such as Edison and Newton would eventually be relegated to a footnote. There is no need for us to conform to irrational expectations and external pressures. Neither do we need to chase accomplishments in the hope of building a legacy. None of us these things last. All that matters is we live life on our own terms. It is the only way we can truly say that we have lived a good life. If you want to eliminate distraction and become more effective in all aspects of life, grab The Productivity Manifesto.

Tonight as I look back at the past few weeks, I can say that my break was filled with success. Success is defined differently for each one of us. When I look and reflect on what success means, I often look at it in terms of \u201cwins\u201d in my day, or weeks as I have mentioned above. In the book Success by Jena Pincott, she writes: I can humbly tell you, I had a successful day today, and I have had successes in my life, but I cannot say that I would be the person to go to, or feel that I am an expert on success. But for the sake of this article, I will share what I did to define my winter break as being successful. The first thing I did over break, was spend time with family for Christmas. There is nothing like being surrounded by those we love to feel validated. I received love and I shared love, and enjoyed the time I spent with them. A few days later, I hosted a dinner at my home for three of my closest friends. These ladies have been in my life for 48 years now. We spent our night sharing a meal, and a lot of memories filled with laughter. The kind of laughter where tears come. We shared good times, and painful times. But most of all, we celebrated our friendship which just about covers the span of our lifetime. I definitely felt rich. I am filled with gratitude for the bond we formed as young girls, still exists today. Deepak Chopra, writer, medical doctor, and CEO of the Chopra Center, says: Yes, I felt the success of these relationships, I celebrated this Christmas. After a few days of down time, walking the dog, reading, and watching Christmas Hallmark movies, and hanging out with my daughter, I knew the time had come. It was time to learn something new, and face my fears, and do something I\u2019ve always wanted to do. Years ago, I discovered Pinterest and Blogging. I thought I should create my own blog. I love to write. But I did what I do best. I gave into my fears. I made excuses. Most of all I procrastinated. But this vacation would be different. I set a goal to create a blog, and began writing. I researched how to set up a blog, and I tried it\u2026 I succeeded!! I was so proud of myself. You can find me on my new blog called Life\u2019s Blessings. http://lifesblessings.net/ For my first post, I shared my story on writing. For more exposure, I also published it here on Medium. (I would love your feedback, please subscribe to my blog or click on the Follow button, to follow me here. Also if you like it, don\u2019t forget to clap!) I have to tell you, it was scary to click the publish button that first time. But, I also discovered how passionate I am about writing. The feeling I get inside when I write, is a joy that fills my soul. I know I am new at publishing my work. However, I am successful, because I am no longer hiding my writing it in a journal to be found years later. I am taking a chance and publishing my work. For me, this is success! It has given purpose to my life. It is filling a creative void. Yes, I would love to build a following of readers, and I know it will take time. But for today, I can say I am successful because I am writing, and you are reading it! I have been doing a lot of reading over my break. I have read books and articles by writers here on Medium. I have learned steps and techniques on being succesful. I will share with you what I have learned, and maybe you will become inspired as I have been.

You won\u2019t believe how responsible I am. It\u2019s like, crazy. Okay so, earlier this week my friends invited me to go to Las Vegas later this month. They said we would fly and stay from Friday to Sunday. At first I thought that sounded doable. I could take Friday off work, and my contribution for the trip wouldn\u2019t cost more than a paycheck. Boom. Easy. Done. But then it happened. I had a\u2026 wait for it\u2026 responsible thought. Oh my gosh! I know right?! I realized that those few hundred dollars would help me pay off my old credit card debt before my birthday in April, which has been my goal this year. I also realized that if I went to Vegas, it would make me miss a session of the class at UCB I\u2019m taking, and I\u2019d rather not miss one out of only eight classes (even though they offer make-up classes, it\u2019s just not the same). And even more importantly, I realized I\u2019d feel better rested and happier at home relaxing for the weekend than stomping around Vegas in uncomfortable heels at 3am with two people I know and five that I don\u2019t. I realized I wanted to make the responsible choice. \u201cBut Elllieeee!\u201d the voice in my head whined, \u201cit\u2019s Vegas!

I only had Starbucks twice this week. I am now a responsible adult. This achievement has been unlocked. The next level is probably actually paying off my debt instead of saying I will without ever paying it, but I\u2019ll cross that bridge when I get there. I\u2019m excited to embark on my adulthood journey, and maybe I\u2019ll even unlock the following achievements soon: Mmmm. I feel so refreshed. I should reward myself. I think I\u2019ll go shopping.

For nostalgia\u2019s sake\u200a\u2014\u200aif one can be nostalgic for something 2 years old\u2014 I wanted to share my first Python program. I initially picked up Python as an aerospace engineering student to avoid spreadsheets and little did I know how good a decision this would turn out to be. My Python education began with the book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart, an excellent application-based book with simple programs to do useful tasks. When I learn a new topic, I look for any chances to use it and I needed a problem to solve in Python. Fortunately, I found one in the form of a $200 textbook required for a class. My personal limit for textbooks is about $20 (Automate the Boring Stuff is free online) and I refused to even rent this book. Desperate to get the book before the first assignment, I saw it was available for a free one-week trial through Amazon with a new account. I got the book for one week and was able to do the first assignment. While I could have kept creating new accounts one week at a time, I needed a better solution. Enter Python and my first programming application. One of many useful libraries in Automate the Boring Stuff is pyautogui which allows you to control the keyboard and mouse through Python. They say when you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail, and that was definitely the case here. Python and pyautogui would allow me to press the arrow keys and take screenshots, and I put the two together to come up with a solution to the book issue. I wrote my first program to automatically turn through every page in the book and take a screenshot. The end program was only 10 lines long yet I was nearly as proud of it as anything I had done in aerospace engineering! Following is the program in its entirety: Running the program is pretty simple (I encourage anyone to try). I saved the script as book_screenshot.py, then pulled up a command prompt in the same folder and typed: Then I would have 5 seconds to flip to the book and put it into fullscreen. The program would do the rest, flipping through every page and taking a screenshot that was saved as a pdf. I could then join all the pdfs together into one file, and have a (questionably legal) copy of the book! Granted, this was a pretty awful copy because it could not be searched, but I made any excuse possible to use my \u201cbook\u201d. This example demonstrates two key points that have stuck with me as I continue my data science education: With just a few lines of code and a free online book, I wrote a program that I actually put to use. Learning the basics can be tedious, and my first attempts to learn Python failed within a few hours as I got stuck with ideas like data structures and loops. Changing tactics, I started to develop solutions to real problems and ended up learning the fundamentals along the way. There is so much to master in programming and data science, but you don\u2019t need to learn everything at once. Pick a problem you need to solve and get started! Since then, I have made a few more sophisticated programs, but I still remember this first script with fondness! Share your first program! I welcome discussion, feedback, and constructive criticism.

I am particularly excited about the potential of smart speakers coupled with advances in A.I. and natural language processing (also looking at you, blockchain). I am bullish on conversational agents in general, previously building an iOS chatbot powered by Watson that simulates a human radiologist. Chatbots are cool and useful, but voice\u200a\u2014\u200athat might be magic. Sensing potential, I decided to hunker down with my trusty corgi, drink a bunch of coffee, and start building the cool voice tools I want to use in my own clinical practice. This experience made me a lot more excited. In this article I will synthesize my findings, show a bunch of fun demo videos, and explain why smart speakers represent a transformative technology in healthcare. Why should people that care about healthcare innovation start thinking about smart speakers? Well\u2026 Imagine for a moment that you are a surgeon. You meticulously scrub your hands and undergo the long and complex process of surgical preparation, methodically putting on sterile gloves and a surgical gown and entering the operating theatre, scalpel in hand, exposed abdomen on the table. You have entered the world of sterility. You are now incapable of checking your phone, which sucks. More importantly, you can no longer use a calculator, consult a medical reference, check the patient\u2019s record, jot down a note\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can\u2019t even Google things. Smart speakers thus offer immense value to all surgeons and proceduralist physicians: they give them their modern technology back. Many important applications can be built around sterility needs, from software allowing physicians to dictate paperwork during surgical downtime to this simple (but useful) sizing tool: The tool I am building uses voice to empower the sterile. The smart speaker allows surgeons to rapidly determine if a particular stent or other device fits within a particular catheter. There are hundreds of devices deployed using catheters, and remembering what fits in what becomes impossible. The current workflow involves constantly asking support staff to check reference materials\u2026an awkward and painful game of telephone. As a case study of one major sterility need, consider the workflow for determining if a particular device is available (for example, a stent of a particular size). The surgeon says, \u201chey\u2026do we have any 5 mm stents?\u201d A human assistant then leaves the room, walks some distance to a storage area, and rummages through piles of boxes looking for stents. Precious minutes later they return and report their findings. This is insanely inefficient, and a voice application allowing surgeons to rapidly query the inventory will be a game-changer. Please consider giving me a small finder\u2019s fee when this makes you $1 billion. Next, imagine that you are a physician in a busy emergency room. You have to see 20 patients before lunch, and after seeing them you have to complete mountains of paperwork documenting your findings. This documentation generally occurs from 5-8 pm as you miss a dinner reservation with your wife and struggle to remember the details of your third patient with a cough. You were also supposed to play fetch with your corgi, and you missed it. These time pressures create physicians that are buried in a computer screen when they should be focusing on their patient, making eye contact, and creating the connection that is fundamental to the physician-patient relationship. And patients are getting mad: Smart speakers solve this problem. They allow physicians to chart data in realtime during a clinical encounter while continuing to make eye contact with the patient. This is huge. It both increases data accuracy\u200a\u2014\u200ayou don\u2019t have to remember it later\u200a\u2014\u200aand creates a better patient experience. It also creates a better physician experience: we became doctors not to jump through documentation hoops but to take care of people and provide excellent, personable care. Everybody wins. Friction is devastating to busy physicians. When you are responsible for 40 hospital patients and time delays are potentially deadly, making an additional click or opening an additional program becomes maddening. Healthcare thus places a premium on immediate information accessed seamlessly. Sure, you could take 3 minutes to look up the latest recommendations for lung nodule management, but it is much better if you can simply \u201cask the room\u201d and get an answer in 5 seconds. This logic inspired me to build a radiology assistant that helps radiologists (my specialty) rapidly access useful information: This tool allows radiologists to quickly access important, yet difficult-to-remember, bits of information that are commonly looked up. And it lets them do so in a split second by simply \u201casking the room.\u201d Hyper-efficient information retrieval is particularly valuable in the setting of a medical emergency. Imagine a cardiac arrest with a critically ill patient getting chest compressions and electric shocks to restart their heart\u200a\u2014\u200ait would be awkward and potentially unsafe to use a smartphone, but you can easily consult Alexa. She might retrieve key information from the medical record, ensure optimal timing of chest compressions, coordinate large teams distributed throughout the hospital, and do many other useful things. Zero-friction information retrieval also facilitates the use of higher quality information.

And I said some, not all. Following a Series A raise, a company has typically gone through numerous growing pains and recruitment drives. And importantly, they are surrounded by sophisticated investors who can help them identify hiring patterns and the type of people they might need to bring in for thir stage of growth. This is just one of many ways smart investors add huge value to startups\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is missing from Token sales. Early-stage startups who have raised a few hundred thousand dollars are a different beast. The team you need for this stage of the company is likely to look different to the team you need when you\u2019ve got $30M to spend on accelerating growth. Crypto companies fall somewhere between this rock and hard place. They have the makings of a pre-product early-stage startup, but bankrolled like a Series A or B company. They have a few founders, little to no technology, no product and certainly no customers. But lots of money to spend on marketing. I\u2019m sure some of the funds is spent on tech people but not enough. Meanwhile, thousands and sometimes, hundreds of thousands of people have already bought an expensive asset from company\u200a\u2014\u200aTokens.

We see a lot of security breaches in the Crypto space, in part, because many of the teams are more focused on community engagement and building their core tech and products, than the tech surrounding their Token. It\u2019s time Crypto companies focused more on hiring people with an established history in roles such as CTO, CISO, DevOps, Operations and other core technology-biased roles before it\u2019s too late. DevOps of course, isn\u2019t the job of one person either\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s a role that all tech people should take on. But I digress.

The first newsroom I worked in didn\u2019t have a single photo person in it. Not a photo desk, not even a photo chair. This was in 1982, so not all that long ago. At this newspaper, photographers were considered part of the service industry. Like a sandwich shop. Reporters (not even editors), would make their order and photographers, regardless of their experience or journalistic chops, would deliver, freaky fast. This is where the Poytner article first goes off the rails. Once again, photographs are just there to serve the wordsmith and their needs. They aren\u2019t a real part of the journalistic process, just a necessary evil to attract eyeballs and generate clicks. The difference now is the person making and delivering the sandwich doesn\u2019t get paid. If you go back a few more decades, you\u2019ll learn that as soon as it was possible to reproduce photographs on the pages of newspapers and magazines, it became essential for publishers who wished to stay in business to do so. It wasn\u2019t a question of want, it was a question of need. National Geographic, Life, Vogue, and countless more newspapers and magazines got into the editorial photography business overnight. Since the beginning, photography has been the most expensive element of the editorial process. Publishers didn\u2019t want to spend this money, but it wasn\u2019t an option. The marketplace demanded it. Now, almost a century later, this historic truth has been forgotten. Photography was and continues to be the ingredient that is most readily skimped on, or cut from the proven recipe used to deliver a satisfying meal to the reader. Publications today are trying to sell chicken soup without the chicken. Meanwhile, the chefs can\u2019t quite figure out why there are so many empty tables in their restaurants. Evidently its the customer\u2019s fault. Diners no longer have the time, inclination or desire to sit down for a good meal. Somehow, they figure, human nature has changed so drastically in the last twenty years that they only want to get their nourishment in pill form, like the Jetsons, dispensed by a machine, 144 characters at a time. So instead of delivering a hearty, well balanced and tasty meal, they decided to compete with the robots. This is the underlying problem when you\u2019re talking about journalism today. Nobody knows anything. They\u2019re all trying to reinvent the wheel just because the delivery system of their product, and it is a product, has changed. Its not the customer\u2019s fault when they abandon you. You can\u2019t blame the marketplace while at the same time ignoring economic laws. The customer has left, and you aren\u2019t giving them a reason to return. Instead of competing and paying for the services of the best photographers and writers, like the publishers of yesteryear, you\u2019ve abandoned them. It wasn\u2019t your logo or brand that attracted readers, it\u2019s what you offered them on your pages. You simply can\u2019t produce eye-worthy content with lesser talents. Talents that, if they worked really hard, had great mentors, great editors and an institutional knowledge supporting them (which they don\u2019t), could someday become medium talents. Yet that\u2019s what you\u2019ve tried to do. In your arrogance, you discarded the people who are responsible for creating your product, your brand that you\u2019re so proud of. You thought your customers wouldn\u2019t notice you\u2019re serving them canned soup. It\u2019s unlikely those talents will be returning. They\u2019ve gone on to (hopefully) better things, or they\u2019ve died. The young talents with great potential have gone away too. These young talents (normally) aren\u2019t stupid. They can read the writing on the wall. Why would they slave away for you, when you are essentially offering them less money and security than they could get working in the fast-food industry? Desire and talent are two different things, both are needed to become great, but only having one (regardless of the amount) will not make up for the other. To become a player in journalism today you need a couple of things that don\u2019t have much to do with creating great content. You need desire, which is good. You need a social media following, which can be both good and bad, depending on how much pandering you do to accumulate these followers, and most importantly you need money. That\u2019s how you really become a player today. With money, you can fly around to different gatherings and make yourself known. You can afford to work for a publication without having to get paid properly. You can create your own cause and use it to build your personal brand. Money gives someone with desire the ability to make a name for themselves, without having to actually create any good work or spend time honing their craft. Lesser and would-be medium talents have inherited the business. They\u2019ve infiltrated every institution, workshop, contest, grant and organization that once was the protector and standard-bearer of institutional knowledge. This could change of course. All it would take is a tiny bit of money. There\u2019s nothing keeping that money from flowing back into the pockets of the creators. You\u2019ve got the richest person in the world running one of the biggest papers in the country. The biggest paper in the country just boasted about making a billion in revenue. We\u2019re talking fractions of a penny on the dollar. The kind of money that doesn\u2019t even amount to an accounting error. If one talented person, a publishers who desires to publish great work, realizes this and breaks herd, they could reverse this trend. Market forces work both ways. Quality, greatness, things that aren\u2019t found in a Happy Meal, there\u2019s a market for that and there might even be some people who remember how its done. The Poytner piece is well meaning, flawed and it points (unwittingly, I think) to the real issue. The writers are attempting to address a real problem that is facing them today. Fair enough. Its flawed because it\u2019s looking to find a way for journalists to survive in a broken system, that doesn\u2019t deserve to survive. While at the same time accepting that system, as the new normal. There\u2019s nothing normal about how journalism is practiced today. The real issue is that in looking to survive in this deeply flawed marketplace, you\u2019re actually subsidizing the system that is marginalizing you. To deliver clicks (such a losing proposition, this clicks scam) to a publisher who cares very little (just look at the various contract negotiations happening at newspapers) about your financial well-being, is allowing that publisher to continue without changing their ways. Both of you are ignoring the marketplace and sooner or later, that sandwich delivery person, who you don\u2019t even bother to tip, is going to spit in your sandwich.

You can find things to support your argument, and you can find things to dissuade you. Example: coffee is bad for you. No, coffee is good for you. Conclusion: nobody knows. Just drink it if you want to drink it. And pour me a cup or ten while you\u2019re at it. The same example applies to the various goals I am working on. For every single goal above I find articles encouraging each pursuit, and then in the next instant I find articles discouraging them. This happened to me last night. I was look around the deep crevices of the internet for freelance writing opportunities. (What a dark and scary place the internet can be). As I was searching I came across many articles with writing opportunities and tools, and then others, sometimes on the same website, saying to keep your writing to part-time, or as a hobby entirely. Not something I wanted to hear. I closed my laptop at that point, completely exhausted. And confused. What am I doing with my time? What is my life about? What is the purpose of living? Why am I here? I asked Lindsay to remove all sharp objects from the house. And then I remembered my OKRs. My Objectives and their Key Results. We\u2019ll talk about them in a minute. I also realized how dangerous research can be. The constant looking. Sometimes Google can be like sitting in the middle of a room with 100 people surrounding you. You ask for each person\u2019s opinion on something you are doing. And they all give you something different\u2026at the same time. What happens in the process is you lose yourself. You may even forget what it was you were looking for in the first place. This is the danger. Losing yourself. Forgetting. This is why establishing and writing down your goals is vitally important. If you don\u2019t there is a good chance you\u2019ll forget, or get so distracted by the opinions of the internet and people in your life that you move on from your idea without ever giving it a real fighting chance. Maybe you will fail at whatever it is, but at least you worked towards it and reached some type of conclusion. You\u2019ll also learn lessons along the way that will stay with you for the rest of your life. This brings us to establishing Objectives and Key Results. Similar to Critical Success Factors (CSFs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). I like Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) because they aren\u2019t used in my day job like CSFs and KPIs are\u00a0:-) I first learned about OKRs from this phenomenal Trello blog post by Claire Drumond. Then I created a Trello board to track my OKRs and now I reference it daily before anything else. Let\u2019s review what makes up an OKR and how you can create some for yourself. Objectives are, quite simply, those things you want to achieve. Travel to a new place, learn a new language, start a business, develop a new skill, etc. Objectives should also be set within a certain timeframe. The easiest way to look at this, especially for personal use, is a single year. In Trello, which we will review below, you could create a board for your 2018 OKRs, and then one for, say, 5-year OKRs, 10-year, and so on. The idea is to know when you want to have each objective completed. The bigger the better. Don\u2019t just think of this as a thing you want to do in your life, think of it as a way you are going to change your life. You need to view this as an improvement to who you currently are. At this end of this year, even if you do not achieve your objective, you will be a better person. Smarter. Wiser. Better off than you were 12 months ago. Make a list of the changes you want to see in your life this year. Then select a few that you can reasonably focus on. Those are your objectives. Here are my big picture objectives: Think big, but don\u2019t set yourself up for failure either. Life happens. Things come up. Things out of your control. Natural disasters. Job loss. Family needs. Illness. You get the idea. That being said, don\u2019t limit yourself\u2026I believe that we all can accomplish whatever we set our minds to. I choose to think of goals, and being realistic, this way: am I willing to do the work required to reach this goal? If yes, proceed. If no, stop (or put it in the 5-year, 10-year, or bucket list). I also view the timeframe as a necessary evil, but certainly not gospel. Example: I want to pay off my student loan this year. It is a large amount to pay off. And I may not actually accomplish this by December 31, 2018. BUT by setting this as an Objective, I am setting out to accomplish it and will work as hard as I can to achieve it. If I don\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t matter. The loan amount will be lower than it is now, and I will be that much closer to reaching my objective. Maybe it will float onto my 2019 OKR board, and that\u2019s ok. I will know that I am that much closer to getting rid of the loan (thank God). Set your objective. Determine if you are willing to put in the work/time/money/sweat/blood/tears to make it happen. Then, start. Be cautious with who you let in, but make sure you tell at least one other person what you are setting out to do this year. The goal here is not feedback per se, or even advice, but just someone to hold you accountable. Someone to check in on your progress, hold you to your goals when you feel like quitting, and cheer you on when you are winning. You will have ups and downs during the year and it will be important, and maybe even a key to your success, to have someone there to help you remain focused. (You could even share your Trello board with them, if they\u2019d like, so that they can see where things are at and what you are working on.) Key Results are how you will know if you have reached your Objective(s) or not. Some objectives may only have one key result, others may have multiple. Don\u2019t complicate this. Pick one of your objectives to focus on. Read it out loud. Now ask yourself what it will look like when that objective has been reached. Whatever comes to mind is what you should record as your key result(s). Again, this does not have to be overly complicated. One of my Objectives is to get a 100% remote full-time job. My key result? \u201cGot a 100% remote full-time job.\u201d If I get the job, I achieved my objective. If I didn\u2019t get the job, I still have work to do (and am probably getting closer). I prefer to keep everything about my life (both work, personal, and side projects) organized in Trello. I do this because I have always preferred Trello to other \u201cproject management\u201d or \u201ctask\u201d applications, and I can utilize services like Zapier and IFTTT to further enhance my overall productivity with Trello. All of that said, you can very easily keep track of your OKRs any way you\u2019d like. Things, Omnifocus, Asana, Todoist, Bullet Journal, etc. Use whatever is best for how you manage things. The only requirement is that it be easy to access on a daily basis. If you want to give Trello a try and don\u2019t have an account, head here to create your free account. Trello is broken down into three primary areas: boards, lists, and cards. Within a single card you can add just about anything you\u2019d like. The first thing you need to do after creating your OKR board is to create a list for each Objective. Here\u2019s what my OKR board looks like. As you can see, each list is a single Objective. Now that you have a list for each objective, it is time to add your Key Results. Each Key Result will be tracked via a card in each list. Again, some Objectives may have a single Key Result, others may have multiple (see image above). The primary goal here is to make sure you know what success looks like for each objective. This is why I review my board on a daily basis. I take a look at what I have planned for the year, then at each key result. What can I do today to make progress on this Objective based on the Key Result(s)? It helps me to ensure that each day contains something that will move me closer to accomplishing my objectives. A nice feature of Trello is the ability to link cards to other boards and even other cards. This is a great way to track your effort for a single Key Result in more detail on a separate board, but not lose track of it. So, you can do your daily review of your OKR board, and then jump to a related board for a specific key result (example below). The power of Trello is that you can manage all of this however you\u2019d like. Some may prefer to keep all of their OKR work in a single board. For me, I prefer to keep separate boards for separate efforts, linking things as I go to keep everything tied back to its original purpose. A good example on my board is the remote work I\u2019m trying to land. I am currently looking for part-time work for the time being, but then in June will be in a position to have a full-time remote job. I have a list and card for each OKR. I also have a separate board related to my job search where I track jobs found, jobs I\u2019m interested in applying to, and jobs I have applied to. I have linked each key result to this board (see below). Again, organize things in a manner that suits you. Finally, back on our OKR board, is labels. Labels is how I have chosen to keep track of the status of each key result. This makes it very simple to see at a glance where things are, and what I should be working on. Plus, labels allow you to filter your board down so you can very quickly only see things that are in the status of, say, planning. Filter it down and figure out how you can move each planning item into the \u201cIn Progress\u201d status. Once you\u2019ve done that you are good to go! Remember to review this every day, and share it with someone who can help you stay focused as you chip away at things. When I first read about OKRs I was turned off at the idea of applying something so \u201ctechnical\u201d to my personal life. But then I thought it about it some more and, obviously, decided that it wouldn\u2019t hurt anything to try. If we establish ways to measure success in our work life, why shouldn\u2019t we also the same thing in our personal life? I would argue we should do more of this activity in our personal life, but that\u2019s a topic for another article. Establishing OKRs in your personal life has many benefits, four of the most important benefits, in my opinion and experience, are below. The overused analogy is a heading off on a road trip. Most people have a destination in mind before they embark. A personal favorite of mine is Oxford, Maryland. A quiet little town in the Maryland Eastern Shore. Before my wife and I leave our house to head to Oxford, I get directions. Those directions keep track of where I am going as I drive, help me make minor adjustments here and there to avoid traffic delays or construction, and ultimately take me to the front door of the bed and breakfast we stay at. This is what OKRs do in your personal life. They provide you with the destination (objective) and then directions on how to get there (key results). This is probably my favorite benefit, because remaining focused is my biggest personal challenge. I lack focus in a very real way. Example: I set out in 2008 to get paid for my writing. Then I got a job and veered off from there. I set out to get paid for my writing again 2010, 2012, and 2016. Distractions, \u201cshiny objects\u201d, always came up and I chased after them like a dog chasing a squirrel. Now here I am again, in 2018, attempting to get paid for my writing via a freelance writing business, exploring the process of traditional publishing, blogging, and even the monetization options here on Medium. Focus is a really tough thing for me. Having this OKR board setup for 2018 is a life saver. My daily review keeps my objectives front and center at the start of each day. Whenever a shiny object comes up I will know to avoid it because, simply, it is not an objective for me this year. (Side note: on a very personal level, I wish Lindsay and I would have used this system back in 2015. In January we did not have the goal of buying a house that year, but then in February we bought one\u2026? It was a shiny object that came out of nowhere, and we didn\u2019t have anything to keep us focused otherwise. So we did it. And honestly, we regret the rushed decision. But, again, topic for another day). There are always going to be things that come up. A friend of mine told me a few weeks ago that I should really look into investing in crypto currency. He\u2019s making thousands. Knows people making millions. I checked my OKR board and didn\u2019t see \u201cInvest in Crypto Currency\u201d as an objective or key result, so didn\u2019t give it a second thought. (I knew right away I wasn\u2019t interested, but checking the board was a way to prove it to myself). If you ever have a \u201cfree\u201d hour appear on your schedule, or a free day even (gasp!), having your OKR board will help you determine how to best use your time. What objective are you currently focusing on? Or which one is most pressing? Which key result can you begin to chip away at, or what steps can you take otherwise to make progress towards completing your objective? Having this information handy will help to avoid wasted time, or time spent working on something that is not getting you closer to your objectives. As this is my first year being proactive about taking a measurable approach to my goal setting, I cannot say that I have experienced what it will be like to reach one of my objectives. But, I can certainly imagine what it will be like! Establishing OKRs will help you to achieve the goals (objectives) that you want to achieve in your life. That, or you will try so hard to achieve a goal but not make it, which is entirely fine! Maybe you decide at that point to remove the objective, or if you still want to keep working at it just carry it forward into the next year. Either way, you will make progress improving your life in ways that you want to improve. Questions? Comments? Concerns? Thoughts? Opinions? Do you use OKRs and find them helpful?

But I want to do more than just that. I want to talk to you about the major crises facing our country that, regrettably, President Trump chose not to discuss. I want to talk to you about the lies that he told during his campaign and the promises he made to working people which he did not keep. Finally, I want to offer a vision of where we should go as a nation which is far different than the divisiveness, dishonesty, and racism coming from the Trump Administration over the past year. President Trump talked tonight about the strength of our economy. Well, he\u2019s right. Official unemployment today is 4.1 percent which is the lowest it has been in years and the stock market in recent months has soared. That\u2019s the good news. But what President Trump failed to mention is that his first year in office marked the lowest level of job creation since 2010. In fact, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 254,000 fewer jobs were created in Trump\u2019s first 11 months in office than were created in the 11 months before he entered office. Further, when we talk about the economy, what\u2019s most important is to understand what is happening to the average worker. And here\u2019s the story that Trump failed to mention tonight. Over the last year, after adjusting for inflation, the average worker in America saw a wage increase of, are you ready for this, 4 cents an hour, or 0.17%. Or, to put it in a different way, that worker received a raise of a little more than $1.60 a week. And, as is often the case, that tiny wage increase disappeared as a result of soaring health care costs. Meanwhile, at a time of massive wealth and income inequality, the rich continue to get much richer while millions of American workers are working two or three jobs just to keep their heads above water. Since March of last year, the three richest people in America saw their wealth increase by more than $68 billion. Three people. A $68 billion increase in wealth. Meanwhile, the average worker saw an increase of 4 cents an hour. Tonight, Donald Trump touted the bonuses he claims workers received because of his so-called \u201ctax reform\u201d bill. What he forgot to mention is that only 2% of Americans report receiving a raise or a bonus because of this tax bill. What he also failed to mention is that some of the corporations that have given out bonuses, such as Walmart, AT&T, General Electric, and Pfizer, are also laying off tens of thousands of their employees. Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Kleenex and Huggies, recently said they were using money from the tax cut to restructure\u200a\u2014\u200alaying off more than 5,000 workers and closing 10 plants. What Trump also forgot to tell you is that while the Walton family of Walmart, the wealthiest family in America, and Jeff Bezos of Amazon, the wealthiest person in this country, have never had it so good, many thousands of their employees are forced onto Medicaid, food stamps, and public housing because of the obscenely low wages they are paid. In my view, that\u2019s wrong. The taxpayers of this country should not be providing corporate welfare to the wealthiest families in this country. Now, let me say a few words about some of the issues that Donald Trump failed to mention tonight, and that is the difference between what he promised the American people as a candidate and what he has delivered as president. Many of you will recall, that during his campaign, Donald Trump told the American people how he was going to provide \u201chealth insurance for everybody,\u201d with \u201cmuch lower deductibles.\u201d That is what he promised working families all across this country during his campaign. But as president he did exactly the opposite. Last year, he supported legislation that would have thrown up to 32 million people off of the health care they had while, at the same time, substantially raising premiums for older Americans. The reality is that although we were able to beat back Trump\u2019s effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, 3 million fewer Americans have health insurance today than before Trump took office and that number will be going even higher in the coming months. During his campaign, Trump promised not to cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. As president, however, he supported a Republican Budget Resolution that proposed slashing Medicaid by $1 trillion and cutting Medicare by $500 billion. Further, President Trump\u2019s own budget called for cutting Social Security Disability Insurance by $64 billion. During Trump\u2019s campaign for president, he talked about how he was going to lower prescription drug prices and take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry which he said was \u201cgetting away with murder.\u201d Tonight he said \u201cone of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs.\u201d But, as president, Trump nominated Alex Azar, a former executive of the Eli Lilly Company\u200a\u2014\u200aone of the largest drug companies in this country\u200a\u2014\u200ato head up the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump spoke about how other countries \u201cdrugs cost far less,\u201d yet he has done nothing to allow Americans to purchase less expensive prescription drugs from abroad or to require Medicare to negotiate drug prices\u200a\u2014\u200awhich he promised he would do when he ran for president. During the campaign, Donald Trump told us that: \u201cThe rich will not be gaining at all\u201d under his tax reform plan. Well, that was quite a whopper. As president, the tax reform legislation Trump signed into law a few weeks ago provides 83 percent of the benefits to the top one percent, drives up the deficit by $1.7 trillion, and raises taxes on 92 million middle class families by the end of the decade. During his campaign for president, Trump talked about how he was going to take on the greed of Wall Street which he said \u201chas caused tremendous problems for us.\u201d As president, not only has Trump not taken on Wall Street, he has appointed more Wall Street billionaires to his administration than any president in history. And now, on behalf of Wall Street, he is trying to repeal the modest provisions of the Dodd-Frank legislation which provide consumer protections against Wall Street thievery. But what is also important to note is not just Trump\u2019s dishonesty. It is that tonight he avoided some of the most important issues facing our country and the world. How can a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention climate change? No, Mr. Trump, climate change is not a \u201choax.\u201d It is a reality which is causing devastating harm all over our country and all over the world and you are dead wrong when you appoint administrators at the EPA and other agencies who are trying to decimate environmental protection rules, and slow down the transition to sustainable energy. How can a president of the United States not discuss the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision which allows billionaires like the Koch brothers to undermine American democracy by spending hundreds of millions of dollars to elect candidates who will represent the rich and the powerful? How can he not talk about Republican governors efforts all across this country to undermine democracy, suppress the vote and make it harder for poor people or people of color to vote? How can he not talk about the fact that in a highly competitive global economy, hundreds of thousands of bright young people are unable to afford to go to college, while millions of others have come out of school deeply in debt? How can he not talk about the inadequate funding and staffing at the Social Security Administration which has resulted in thousands of people with disabilities dying because they did not get their claims processed in time? How can he not talk about the retirement crisis facing the working people of this country and the fact that over half of older workers have no retirement savings? We need to strengthen pensions in this country, not take them away from millions of workers. How can he not talk about the reality that Russia, through cyberwarfare, interfered in our election in 2016, is interfering in democratic elections all over the world, and according to his own CIA director will likely interfere in the 2018 midterm elections that we will be holding. How do you not talk about that unless you have a very special relationship with Mr. Putin? Now, let me say a few words about what Trump did talk about. Trump talked about DACA and immigration, but what he did not tell the American people is that he precipitated this crisis in September by repealing President Obama\u2019s executive order protecting Dreamers. We need to seriously address the issue of immigration but that does not mean dividing families and reducing legal immigration by 25\u201350 percent. It sure doesn\u2019t mean forcing taxpayers to spend $25 billion on a wall that candidate Trump promised Mexico would pay for. And it definitely doesn\u2019t mean a racist immigration policy that excludes people of color from around the world. To my mind, this is one of the great moral issues facing our country. It would be unspeakable and a moral stain on our nation if we turned our backs on these 800,000 young people who were born and raised in this country and who know no other home but the United States. And that\u2019s not just Bernie Sanders talking. Poll after poll shows that over 80 percent of the American people believe that we should protect the legal status of these young people and provide them with a path toward citizenship. We need to pass the bi-partisan DREAM Act, and we need to pass it now. President Trump also talked about the need to rebuild our country\u2019s infrastructure. And he is absolutely right. But the proposal he is bringing forth is dead wrong. Instead of spending $1.5 trillion over ten years rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, Trump would encourage states to sell our nation\u2019s highways, bridges, and other vital infrastructure to Wall Street, wealthy campaign contributors, even foreign governments. And how would Wall Street and these corporations recoup their investments? By imposing massive new tolls and fees paid for by American commuters and homeowners. The reality is that Trump\u2019s plan to privatize our nation\u2019s infrastructure is an old idea that has never worked and never will work. Tonight, Donald Trump correctly talked about the need to address the opioid crisis. Well, I say to Donald Trump, you don\u2019t help people suffering from opioid addiction by cutting Medicaid by $1 trillion. If you are serious about dealing with this crisis, we need to expand, not cut Medicaid. My fellow Americans. The simple truth is that, according to virtually every poll, Donald Trump is the least popular president after one year in office of any president in modern American history. And the reason for that is pretty clear. The American people do not want a president who is compulsively dishonest, who is a bully, who actively represents the interests of the billionaire class, who is anti-science, and who is trying to divide us up based on the color of our skin, our nation of origin, our religion, our gender, or our sexual orientation. That is not what the American people want. And that reality is the bad news that we have to deal with. But the truth is that there is a lot of good news out there as well. It\u2019s not just that so many of our people disagree with Trump\u2019s policies, temperament, and behavior. It is that the vast majority of our people have a very different vision for the future of our country than what Trump and the Republican leadership are giving us. In an unprecedented way, we are witnessing a revitalization of American democracy with more and more people standing up and fighting back. A little more than a year ago we saw millions of people take to the streets for the women\u2019s marches and a few weeks ago, in hundreds of cities and towns around the world, people once again took to the streets in the fight for social, economic, racial and environmental justice. Further, we are seeing the growth of grassroots organizations and people from every conceivable background starting to run for office\u200a\u2014\u200afor school board, city council, state legislature, the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate. In fact, we are starting to see the beginning of a political revolution, something long overdue. And these candidates, from coast to coast, are standing tall for a progressive agenda, an agenda that works for the working families of our country and not just the billionaire class. These candidates understand that the United States has got to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all as a right, not a privilege, through a Medicare for All, single-payer program. They understand that at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, when the top one-tenth of one percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, we should not be giving tax breaks for billionaires but demanding that they start paying their fair share of taxes. They know that we need trade policies that benefit working people, not large multi-national corporations. They know that we have got to take on the fossil fuel industry, transform our energy system and move to sustainable energies like wind, solar and geothermal. They know that we need a $15 an hour federal minimum wage, free tuition at public colleges and universities, and universal childcare. They understand that it is a woman who has the right to control their own bodies, not state and federal governments, and that woman has the right to receive equal pay for equal work and work in a safe environment free from harassment. They also know that if we are going to move forward successfully as a democracy we need real criminal justice reform and we need to finally address comprehensive immigration reform. Yes. I understand that the Koch brothers and their billionaire friends are planning to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2018 mid-term elections supporting the Trump agenda and right-wing Republicans. They have the money, an unlimited amount of money. But we have the people, and when ordinary people stand up and fight for justice there is nothing that we cannot accomplish. That has been the history of America, and that is our future. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out. Sen.

Working in a high capacity for a long period of time can exhaust anyone, and if you are not taking the proper amount of time to rest, your body will crash, and it will have consequences on everything you do. That\u2019s why it makes a lot of sense to start everything here. Now, I won\u2019t tell you to sleep for 8 hours every night or to wake up at a specific hour. That\u2019s entirely up to you. Instead, your goal should be to find the right time to go to bed and the right time to wake up, so you can get enough rest, remain healthy and feel energized. The moment you step outside and let the daily momentum kick in, you slowly reduce the control over how your day pans out. That control is difficult to re-gain later in the day. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential to wake up earlier and use the first couple of hours so that you can take control over your state of mind and your body. In those few hours, you\u2019ll kickstart the day in the way it suits you best. The sedentary lifestyle is slowly killing us, and we are not even noticing it. You need to make a deal with yourself that no matter what happens in your life, health comes first\u200a\u2014\u200awhich means that you need to take care of yourself first before you engage in anything else. There are only two things you need to keep in mind: Make small actions every day, and let the compound effect do its thing. We live in a world where everything is designed to steal your attention (including this article), and that makes it challenging to find a peaceful moment just for yourself. And these moments are necessary if we\u2019re going to keep clarity and calmness of our mind. That\u2019s why you need to find few minutes a day\u200a\u2014\u200apreferably earlier in the day, to create a grounding effect that will help you center yourself, and re-focus on what\u2019s important. If nothing, just to breathe and calm your thoughts. It\u2019s easy to get swept away with the dynamic environment we live in. Because of this, you need to constantly pull yourself back and plan out how you want your life to unfold instead of letting the external circumstances do it for you. Execution is what matters, but this depends solely on your ability to plan and follow through on that plan. Not all things you do will give you a high return on investment. Your time is precious, and you should be careful where you\u2019re allocating it. Whenever in doubt, look at your plan, and ask yourself: And then do it. Know that your goals dictate what you need to learn. You should never randomly acquire skills. Try instead to learn the skills that will help you achieve your goals, no matter in what area of your life. Know that every skill you acquire will not be beneficial on its own but will stack up with every skill you\u2019ve acquired earlier, and you will start moving forward. Reading, no matter the genre sparks creativity and unleashes your imagination. The reason for this is because every new idea a book can offer (no matter how small it seems) interacts with the knowledge you already have. So whenever you open a book, look for just one idea, and see how you can apply it in everyday life. If you are the most active person in the room, you are in the wrong room. Find people that are doing something incredible with their lives and learn from them. Even interacting with people who are driven and are accomplishing something in their life will serve as an inspiration. It will get you to take action. Time is passing by faster than ever because we have more things that preoccupy us. This makes it challenging to take a break to reflect and evaluate how our lives are turning out. So, just before you go to bed, give yourself a goal to evaluate your day and what can be improved the next day. Not only this but every couple of months you should take a day or two to evaluate your plans. To see what delivers results, and what needs to be cut. Then, adapt your plan and don\u2019t be afraid to pivot if necessary.

We believe that balance means that all things are of equal value, meaning we should have an equal time of work and play. Instead, for work/life balance, we should be using a different definition of balance: a condition in which different elements are in the correct proportions. This misunderstanding of balance leads us to spend 8 hours a night sleeping, 8 hours a day at work (minimum, if you\u2019re lucky), and the remaining 8 hours doing tasks like eating, exercise, personal time, and spending time with family. We see those 8-hour blocks of time as balance, but we\u2019re missing one huge thing: quality. When you think about the quality of your life, where does work fall? Likely, somewhere behind family and health, and possibly behind experiences. Our work/life balance doesn\u2019t really fit with the personal importance of each element of our life. Most people, especially business owners, short change their priorities for more work\u200a\u2014\u200aand this not the best way! So what can we do about it? I wish I could tell you that I\u2019ve cracked the code for how to add more hours to your day so that you can do it all, but I haven\u2019t. I wish I could tell you that I\u2019ve found a realistic way to cut your work in half so that you have more time for other things, but once again, I haven\u2019t. I can, however, tell you that balance does not mean that all sides are equal, and I can tell you ways to build in more time for things that matter. You\u2019ve heard time and time again that you need to have a daily task list. You\u2019ve heard that you need to put the most time consuming and easily avoidable tasks first. There is so much advice about how to prioritize your daily work schedule, but few talk about passion. What are you passionate about? What is the reason you started your business? Was it to post an update to Facebook every day? Likely not. When you find tasks like these that you dread, or are time-consuming, outside of your area of expertise or passion, or just plain drain you, delegate them. About 9 months ago, I realized that I was using too much of my work time doing administrative tasks that didn\u2019t add to the company\u2019s bottom line, that I didn\u2019t enjoy, and that kept me from taking on more clients. I remedied that by hiring a part time virtual assistant. The time I save by delegating work that needs to be done but not by me, adds to my quality of life and minimizes the time I spend doing tedious work. Financially, it\u2019s beneficial because I regained a few billable hours to my week which far outweigh the cost of hiring someone to do the tasks I don\u2019t enjoy. There was a ridiculous article I read a few weeks ago, explaining all of the things that so-called experts tell us we must do each day to live a healthy life. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read how much time you\u2019re supposed to exercise, and what you should be eating, and how sitting is killing you. Yesterday, I read that sitting for 2 hours negates 20 minutes of working out. If that\u2019s correct, then the average employee who sits while working needs to combat that with 80 minutes of exercise (on top of your already busy day). I fall into that idle employee, but I decided to make a few small changes that help me stay a bit more active. When I can, I work at a standing desk. I thought I would hate it, but I actually enjoy it. When I sit, I use a Yoga ball or stabilizing stool. I raised my computer up so that I wasn\u2019t hunched over all day. Being a consultant, I spend a couple hours daily on my phone. Instead of sitting, I pace. I walk from room to room, back and forth, taking notes when I need to. These small changes mean that instead of sitting for 8 (or more) hours at work, I sit for 2\u20133, with frequent breaks. Breakfast is normally grabbed quickly, and lunch is normally something revived in the microwave. I enjoy cooking and typically cook every dinner we eat in a given week. As much as I like to cook, and more so like to eat healthily, this is an area that is time-consuming. Grocery shopping, food prep, and meal planning are important, but as my time feels more and more crunched by outside obligations, fast food and convenience items creep in. Instead of planning a weekly menu, I recently decided to try a meal service. Each week, I receive the ingredients (portion controlled) for 3 meals. Allowing this decision to be made for me frees up not only meal planning and prep times, but it also frees up mental space, allowing me to feel more relaxed and less rushed. For breakfast, lunch, and snacks, my meal prep time saves the day. Breakfast is typically a protein shake or green smoothie. Having everything portioned out ahead of time in appropriate size containers takes away any excuse that leads me through the McDonald\u2019s drive-thru. Lunch consists of grilled chicken, fresh veggies, a piece of fruit, and some sort of dipping sauce, like ranch or Asian peanut sauce. One day a week, I prep all of the chicken for lunch, then freeze whatever I won\u2019t use within a couple days. Each day at lunchtime, I replenish what I used from the freezer. Snacks consist of sliced salami, cheese, and veggies. Planning ahead of time and taking the excuses out of your meals makes staying on track a lot easier. It\u2019s easy to get caught up and stressed out in work life. It\u2019s easy to be \u201coff the clock,\u201d but still feel like there\u2019s more you can get done if you just do a little work in the evening or on weekends. With running two companies, I definitely feel like I can capitalize on my relaxation time in the evening by doing work. What I realized is that by not shutting off my work brain, I was shortchanging my family. I wasn\u2019t present in their needs and wants. Instead of giving them my full attention, they would get less than half my attention as I typed or read away on my laptop. Instead of enjoying my time away from work, I was trying to fit my family in around work, not the other way around. Lately, I set a quitting time. What I\u2019ve realized is that a lot of the tasks that I thought were crucial to my success were time fillers and wasters, and rarely added value to my business. I also realized that as a partner and mother, my time with them is limited. In a little over 7 years, my son will be off to college. I want to have a relationship with him while we are under the same roof, and more importantly, I want to build a better relationship with my partner, because while my son will temporarily live with me, my partner will be here long after, and we need to have a good foundation. Instead of focusing on fitting in work in the after-hours, I focus on fitting in games, conversations, and being together. When faced with a 24 hour day, with not enough time to get things done, many people cut sleep first. Reducing your sleep, however, reduces every aspect in your quality of life. A lack of sleep ruins your focus, making you less productive, and more likely to waste time and get less done in your work life. A lack of sleep makes it less likely for you to get up and keep moving throughout your day, making you more likely to shorten your lifespan, among other health-related issues. A lack of sleep makes smarter choices less likely to happen, especially when they\u2019re food or drink related. A lack of sleep makes you short and irritable with your loved ones, hurting feelings and relationships. Sleep is crucial to your success at every level.

But in no time these market places called play store, Windows Store, App Store became a rich reaping ground (or dump ground!) for many such digital services which gave users many options to increase and personalize the functionalities of their devices (smartphone, watch, smart speakers). Following the previous trend we can project it to an era, where the Virtual Reality (or Mixed Reality) marketplace will start to develop (infact we can see its buds already). Though when i say Mixed reality market place, i don\u2019t want you to get confused with the VR application available on playstore or App store. What i rather mean is that in the near future various companies will create their Mixed reality Engines to be made available for public to use their services or to buy their products, let\u2019s call such platforms as \u201cMixed Reality Environments\u201d. These Environments will be a replacement (or advancement) of present day mobile applications, exactly the same way as apps became replacement (or advancement) to websites.There will be then a \u201cEnvironment Store \u201d (same as Playstore/App Store) where the users can find say, \u2018Amazon Environment\u2019, downloading and playing that environment in your Mixed reality headset will make you browse the 3-d visuals of the products available at Amazon.com right from your home.\u00a0There will be a \u2018Facebook Environment\u2019 which will be available for free of course, since that\u2019s the promise Facebook made! And in the Facebook environment the user can send the message to her friend by instructing to a virtual assistant, she can see the 360 degree photograph sent by her child, while can also make a 3-D holographic video call to her colleague. The mobile phones will be slowly replaced by the Mixed reality headsets and the information will be perceived through tangible or mixed digital products. The development of such Environments will require\u00a0:\u00a01. A strong developed system of Artificial Intelligence to understand user\u2019s choices, actions, words, and intentions appropriately to assist user in making interactions with the environment. 2. Lighter Mixed Reality headset, they can be also smart glasses or lenses but anything which is light enough to allow the user to use them for hours and without making them to drop their heads onto pillow with every 1 Hr. usage. A task which almost all Tech giants are seeking today but has been achieved effectively by none till now. 3. A highly effective design for User Experiences, because an environment of only tangible (or virtual) products carrying information, is NOT an environment of 0 number of screens but is an environment of infinite number of them. The bad UX in such environment can not just mean financial loss of company, or lesser user clicks! rather a slight error can even lead to nauseatic experience for the audience. Thus, every component has to be designed with much minute details. 4. The market place can only exist when various companies develop environment for the users to interact with the goods and services of their companies. Also, the future of Mixed Reality can not be governed by one company alone, it will be combination of different environment of different companies (just like apps in present day mobiles). So, there is a high possibility that in future, someone will book a cab (or micro aircraft) inside an Uber Environment using some more advance version Microsoft\u2019s Hololens. (exactly like booking cab by using Uber app on Windows Lumia phone) So, the world depicted by the movie Wall-E is not that far away, but also it is neither too close.

It was the culmination of an extraordinarily surreal week of intense international press coverage, nonstop phone and email interviews, all accompanied by my growing sense that I had not merely written a humorous spell that had gone viral, but had unknowingly assisted in the birth of something far bigger. When I first posted the text of the spell here on Medium, I assumed it might generate minor interest in the progressive pagan and magical communities, and maybe some appreciative chuckles from my network of artists and activists. Instead, with a viral rapacity that could not have existed before social networks, it exploded exponentially and became a novel, rapidly growing social movement under the umbrella hashtag #MagicResistance. Something had emerged from our shattered collective psyche as we comprehended the enormity of the unspooling Trumpian dystopia\u200a\u2014\u200aa deep and widespread desire to employ our spiritual energy as an act of resistance. Every waning crescent moon since that February evening, people around the world have gathered at a minute before midnight (US Eastern Time) to focus their consciousness in a ritualistic effort to bind Donald Trump and his kakistocratic cohorts from doing harm. Some gather in groups, but most do the ritual alone or with a significant other. Afterward, many of these witches, magicians, artists, and activists gather on Facebook and other social media to share photos of their altars (many of which are beautiful works of art in their own right) as well as their their emotions, visions, and experiences. For the majority, the spell is liberating and energizing, a reclaiming of personal power and an affirmation of their deeply held values in the face of the firehose of negativity from the White House, the GOP, and the 24/7 \u201cnews.\u201d Far from being ineffectual \u201cslacktivism,\u201d the ritual (and others developed by participants) helps many of us stay focused, committed, and invigorated for our everyday activism and resistance. It has become a spiritual balm and a monthly reminder of our committment to fighting injustice and the the ongoing dismantling of our liberal democracy. And though the term #MagicResistance is new, ritual and magical acts aimed at oppressive powers and tyrants date back to antiquity, as will be described in my upcoming book, Magic for the Resistance: Rituals and Spells for Change (Llewellyn Worldwide, Fall 2018). From Greeks and Romans of the ancient world inscribing lead tablets with binding spells against government officials, Medieval peasants creating wax effigies of hated monarchs, enslaved Africans calling to the loas in their fight for freedom in Haiti, to British witches raising a \u201ccone of power\u201d to prevent Hitler\u2019s invasion of their homeland, magic has always been employed by the common people against their oppressors. One can debate its efficacy, of course, but its tactical appeal is deep and timeless. From the beginning, it has been clear that the #MagicResistance is much bigger than Donald Trump and his crooked cabal. Trump is merely the symptom, like the eruption of a pus-filled boil, of currents that have always flowed beneath the thin veneer of social progress\u2014racism, militarism, materialism, misogyny, patriarchy, homophobia, xenophobia, and a host of other -isms and -phobias exemplifying the anti-evolutionary sicknesses of our species. Donald Trump is every boss who leers at his assistant\u2019s breasts, every bully screaming \u201cfaggot\u201d at a crying kid in the locker room, every bank manager redlining an African-American family trying to buy a home, every bigot telling a Guatemalan immigrant to \u201cspeak American or go back to where you came from,\u201d every Wall Street trader ignoring the pleading eyes of a homeless veteran, every healthcare bean counter rejecting the claim for a sick child, every pharma executive jacking up the cost of cancer drugs, every guy in a pickup truck \u201crolling coal\u201d as he passes a Prius, and every pedophile barging into a dressing room full of young women \u201cbecause he can.\u201d Our resistance is bigger than Trump, and will still be required when he is relegated to the garbage heap of failed tyrants. Authoritarianism, white supremacy, and xenophobia were globally resurgent before Trump ran for office. The richest of the rich keep taking more from everyone else, and the poor keep sinking further into misery. Accelerating climate change threatens every person, and every living creature, on our planet. Our crises are of the spirit, and require spiritual solutions. So tonight, I\u2019ll stand before my altar, alone, but knowing thousands of others are saying the same words, in unison, around our beautiful, fragile planet, dedicating themselves to the long, hard, but essential fight before us. As we say together: In the name of all who walkCrawl, swim, or flyOf all the trees, the forests,Streams, deserts,Rivers and seasIn the name of JusticeAnd LibertyAnd LoveAnd EqualityAnd Peace So mote it be.

This is not a secret meeting of any sorts, it is however a private invite-only conference. There is a lot confusion about what this exactly means. I know that in the Bitcoin community there is a large conspiracy theory crowd and sadly I\u2019ve seen people compare it to the NYA. This makes no sense, no decisions are being made at the Roundtable. It is more about bringing like-minded people together, discuss topics freely and network. There are many different kinds of people there going from CEOs of Bitcoin and blockchain-related companies, developers, fund manager, influencers, meetup organizers,\u2026 It\u2019s a very diverse group with even some ponies and pandas. Before the start of the conference everyone is reminded of the Chatham House rules: You can mention what was being discussed during the conference, but you can\u2019t mention who said what. You\u2019re also not allowed to post pictures and videos without explicit permission of the people involved. Since this was my first one I asked a couple of \u201cregulars\u201d how this compared to the previous ones. This year there were around 150\u2013200 attendees which was more than double compared to the previous year. This makes sense since the entire industry is booming. I know that this has been a hot topic lately and unlike some other events there were a lot of women around. There is of course always still room for improvement. There are people from all around the world, but most are US & Canada based. Last year some people complained about the venue, this year it was top-notch and very well organized. The previous years were a bit overshadowed by the whole scaling debate, since we solved scaling indefinitely everything was a lot more relaxed. It also might have helped that some people decided not to come this year. The first evening there was a cocktail reception and dinner with entertainment from which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen pictures on social media. The following morning the \u201cunconference\u201d started. In the past there were more sheduled talks, this year they decided to let the participants pick the topics they wanted to talk about.\u00a0There were 6 different tracks in 6 different rooms so you always had the possibility to pick something that might be interesting to you. There were only 2 talks where there was a \u201cfull house\u201d and that was the Ron Paul speech and the Tether discussion. What did surprise me actually is how certain big companies weren\u2019t represented at all. I don\u2019t think it had anything to do with them not being invited, I\u2019m sure they were, but they might not have found it interesting enough. If you are a big company and you don\u2019t send anyone to this event, that is a huge mistake. There is no other conference where you can network and talk so freely without any fear of someone overhearing something crucial and publishing it somewhere. I didn\u2019t know what to expect. I don\u2019t have a business, would this be useful for me? It\u2019s a private event with an illustrious name and reputation so of course I would go check it out, if it wasn\u2019t interesting I would just go once and that\u2019s it. I arrived a day early and the hotel was amazing, by far the best hotel I\u2019ve ever been to. It surprised me how few people I actually knew in the industry. It\u2019s also always a bit awkward to introduce myself and then say \u201cI\u2019m just a guy on Twitter that wrote some articles and that also happens to trade from time to time\u201d.\u00a0One thing I do find interesting when doing the small talk, I\u2019ve noticed this before at other Bitcoin events too, is that no one asks where you\u2019re from. It doesn\u2019t matter where you\u2019re from, people do ask \u201cwhere are you based?\u201d. The most important thing about the Roundtable is the relaxed and friendly atmosphere. Try to have a normal conversation with someone like Riccardo Spagni at any conference and you get interrupted every 30 seconds by someone else who just jumps in on the conversation and wants to take a picture with him. Here people can let their guard down and be \u201creal\u201d (for lack of a better word). Everyone is very inclusive, the last night we went to one of the restaurants and what started as a table with 2 people ended with a table of 12. Jameson Lopp and Caitlin Long already wrote articles about the Roundtable and that makes my job easier since I have to cover less topics. For me some of the more interesting discussions were about sidechains, anonymous/privacy focused coins, difficulties of hiring & finding blockchain/crypto/Bitcoin devs and personal security. A number floating around was that there is 1 developer for 14 open vacancies. Jameson already listed the main reasons in his article. Some of the discussions were about finding skilled developers and then try to convince them to join your company through financial incentives.\u00a0One of the most interesting suggestions a company already implemented was to give every employee a certain amount of bitcoin on an exchange which they can trade for other coins. That way they were more motivated to learn about cryptocurrencies. 2017 obviously was a very profitable year for some of the employees. One of the people organizing the security for the event joined us and that gave a new extra dimension to the personal security conversation.\u00a0The interesting thing was that it was the day the Forbes Crypto rich list was published. That\u2019s obviously the first thing you should never do since it makes you a big target, cryptocurrencies being a bearer asset and all that.\u00a0Most of the older generation have decent OPSEC, a bigger and easier target would probably be the new ICO-rich people who haven\u2019t been in the industry for that long and don\u2019t even have decent OPSEC practices. I put this at the bottom so if you wanted to read about Tether you had to read the whole thing. Tether was discussed with the majority of the people attending this talk, however before the discussion started they asked repeatedly to take into consideration the Chatham House rules. The whole point of it is that it can be sensitive information and that according to the rules you shouldn\u2019t be able to identify who said what. Releasing a transcript of it, even without explicitly mentioning names, would still make it all very obvious of who was talking.That being said: for me there were no real surprises there. I think the biggest risk for Tether is regulatory. This event was extremely well organized and if you have the possibility to attend I would really recommend you do. There are so many interesting people with the same general interests in the same place which really makes it all worthwhile. The relaxed atmosphere and Chatham House rules make people speak more freely and be more open. Some final thoughts: After the Roundtable I heard that another guy who claims that he was part of Satoshi attended. I wasn\u2019t aware of it at that time. He managed to convince some of the more naive attendees and of course he didn\u2019t provide any cryptographic proof. I would like to recommend to the organizers to not invite con men like that, or people that support the unproven claims of these types of con men. (I don\u2019t think the organizers were aware this was going to happen now) By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out. Crypto OG.

This is the equivalent of the old saw (pun intended) \u201cthis board is too short. Better cut it again.\u201d Apparently Nunes feels he didn\u2019t do enough harm by pretending to be giving the White House information he was receiving from the White House, sneaking around the White House lawn, or co-writing a goofy memo that was about as helpful to the cause as sitting Malcolm Butler was to the cause of those other Patriots. Nunes, while not denying that the White House again may have crafted this material, acknowledged that Trey Gowdy was responsible for much of the memo, as he is the only Republican in House Leadership who can read. (Correction: Nunes says that Gowdy was the only one who \u201ccould read the FISA Application,\u201d not the only one who could read. Observers have identified at least 11 other Republican House Members who can read. We apologize for the error\u200a\u2014\u200aand we count on the 11 who can read to pass our apologies on to their colleagues.) To put that in perspective, that means this guy: Went to this guy: To do the book report on a book that he didn\u2019t read, and the guy who read it couldn\u2019t be bothered with the little numbered things down at the bottom. And without a hint of irony, they are members of the \u201cIntelligence Committee.\u201d It should also be noted that Gowdy read the info, wrote the report, then retired from Congress. Even though they put their best reader (Gowdy) on the case, there were still some problems. It seems their star reader skipped the footnotes. Footnotes are those pesky little things at the bottom of a document that tell you where the information came from. The sneaky and duplicitous FBI agents who requested the FISA warrant on Carter Page hid the disclosure about where the dossier came from\u200a\u2014\u200ain the place reserved for things such as disclosing where the dossier came from. A situation so vile and evil that the president himself called it an \u201cAmerican disgrace.\u201d Speaking of disgraces, General John Kelly this week made some news of his own. Kelly, who appears to be Trump\u2019s intellectual equal, Stephen Miller\u2019s ideological equal, and Reince Priebus\u2019s (sp?) managerial equal, this week suggested that the DACA eligible persons who have not registered may have been too lazy to get off their fat asses and register. Later in the week, when presented with the Democrat\u2019s rebuttal to the Nunes memo, Kelly stated that the president had not yet been able to read it\u200a\u2014\u200asomehow forgetting his \u201ctoo lazy to get off their fat ass\u201d line reserved for persons of color other than orange. In fairness, the president may have been busy planning his military parade or helping Nunes write his memo. Kelly followed that up by stating how much he likes and supports Rob Porter, the Staff Secretary to the President of The United States, whom the world learned this week\u200a\u2014\u200aand the Trump administration learned last year\u200a\u2014\u200ahas been accused of serial spouse abuse. In his defense, Kelly, who was brought on to restore rationality and reason to the White House, issued his first statement when there were only police reports, FBI reports, protective orders, a disclosure that Porter has not received the requisite security clearance for someone in his position, and the accounts of the two women\u200a\u2014\u200athe photos of the end result of the abuse were not yet public. Once they became public, Kelly became shocked. Also in his defense, he may not have written his first statement. Twenty-nine year old model turned White House Communications Director/girlfriend of the above mentioned Rob Porter (who has since resigned on his own, yet hasn\u2019t seemed to have left yet) appears to have written the statement for him. Sadly, this entire paragraph has not been made up. All of these personnel problems come, we remind you, from an administration that likes to tell us that Trump hires the best people. Well, except maybe for the felons, spies, Russian assets, liars, racists, international money launderers, Hungarian fugitives, fired and rehired reality \u201cstars,\u201d and spousal abusers. And every single time one of these pops up, the White House acts surprised or \u201cshocked\u201d as they like to say. It\u2019s like finding corn in your poop. Sure, it\u2019s surprising\u00a0\u2026 when you are four and had never experienced it before. But you can\u2019t be surprised every single morning after eating corn on the cob. In case you struggled to follow that, we are suggesting that Rob Porter is simply the corn in this shitty administration. It happens to the best of them. Even John Kelly has been acting more like a kernel than a General lately. In other news, the stock market has had a tumultuous week\u200a\u2014\u200asetting records for biggest single-day drop, and biggest multiple day drops just in the past week alone. As amateur financial analysts and occasional observers of the goings-on on Wall St., we can tell you that we have no fucking idea why. That also happens to be the analysis of professional financial analysts and close observers of the goings-on on Wall St. Initially, experts were saying that it was because of a strong jobs report. (Like most things involving Wall St., this makes absolutely no sense to us.) The next explanation was that the market was reacting to fears of inflation. That then morphed into \u201cthe market went down because the economy is so good.\u201d Then, as the stock market rebounded slightly through the course of a given day, it was because the fundamentals of the economy are strong. All of this analysis was being broadcast on the 24 hours news networks as though it were Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server. Which is ironic, as we happen to believe Hillary\u2019s server caused this market volatility.

You\u2019ll note we didn\u2019t write anything this week about Congress being so dysfunctional that they nearly shut down the government.

Both cases are predicated on a seven-month long investigation during which it was discovered that Google has been illegally appropriating advertisers\u2019 funds. In the meantime, an independent investigation was being conducted by the Wall Street Journal that lead to the same conclusion. As a result of the WSJ article, Google promptly changed millions of AdWords contracts to prevent advertisers from obtaining redress. Several media outlets rushed to cover the lawsuit, unfortunately missing the main point by focusing too narrowly on AdTrader\u2019s potential damages instead. While they might interest a select group of readers, our personal losses are certainly not of significant importance to the public. Google\u2019s systematic theft, however is, and it is why we decided to share more details about our investigation and invite all affected advertisers to join our class action lawsuit. Bringing simplicity and transparency to an increasingly crowded and opaque ad ecosystem. AdTrader\u2019s mission has always been to make the digital advertising space a healthier and more efficient ecosystem. In an industry plagued by an endless array of intermediaries, overwhelming complexity, and tremendous inefficiencies, we set to offer an alternative solution. Four years ago, we decided to build an ad platform that would bring more simplicity, transparency, and accountability for publishers and advertisers, and most importantly, a more useful and pleasant advertising experience for users. We partnered with some of the major advertising companies to expand our reach and offering, and started building both the technology we needed and the team which would eventually bring our vision to fruition. In the past six years, the number of middlemen has increased more than fivefold: The ever-expanding intermediary landscape was, and still is, a constant source of frustration for advertisers and publishers. We were doing our best to successfully navigate across it and deliver the most optimal results for our clients. We were managing a bootstrapped and steadily growing advertising business right until the day Google seized $0.5M of our earnings accrued by over 200 publishers from 25 different countries. Our conscious decision to remain independent from VC funding had made us financially vulnerable to such unforeseen misconduct from our largest business partner. Nevertheless, we were determined to protect our publishers and compensate their seized earnings out of our own pocket. This left us nearly bankrupt, but it was undoubtedly the right thing to do. We eventually pulled through and are now focused more than ever on the goals ahead of us. We felt obligated to share publicly our discoveries of Google\u2019s systematic misappropriation of funds. While we surely have better things to do than rant about our competitors, Google\u2019s illegal appropriation of funds has such far-reaching implications for the entire advertising ecosystem that we felt obligated to share publicly our discoveries. Google\u2019s monopolistic misconduct has been covered extensively in the news this past year, from its anti-competitive practices in shopping search [1], to abusing its Android smartphone monopoly [2], and tying up AdSense publishers to exclusivity agreements that throttle competitors [3]. However, little attention was given to one of the key drivers of Google\u2019s revenue\u200a\u2014\u200adisplay advertising. This post intends to take you through some of the steps in our investigation and hopefully encourage advertisers to look more critically at their dealings with Google. In May 2017, our four-year partnership with Google\u2019s DoubleClick Ad Exchange (AdX) was abruptly terminated and 476,622.69 USD accrued by our publisher clients were seized from our account. Despite our persistent requests for an explanation, Google did not provide any specific reason for this action. It did, however, repeatedly stress that all publisher earnings would be returned to the advertisers. The unexpected chain of events and the lack of information compelled us to further investigate the matter in an effort to understand what had gone wrong. While digging deeper, some alarming findings started to surface. The significance of these findings extended far beyond our personal case. We confirmed through multiple sources, both within and outside of Google, through our Google invoices, and data collected from Google APIs that Google never actually refunded any of the confiscated publisher earnings to the advertisers. In fact, Google\u2019s own support team admitted that they never had a system in place for such refunds. Google\u2019s demand-side platform for advertisers, DoubleClick Bid Manager (DBM), could apparently only filter invalid impressions in real-time, before they are ever charged to the advertisers. It did not have a mechanism for retroactive refunds. This was later confirmed by a Google spokesperson, who announced that they have only recently began to devise measures for refunds on DBM [6]. Four months into our research, we were surprised to find out that The Wall Street Journal had conducted their own investigation into the subject, reporting facts that further solidified our discoveries [4]. Most significantly, six days after the WSJ article was published, Google swiftly changed their AdWords contract, effectively forcing millions of advertisers to waive their respective rights to trial by jury and prohibiting them from bringing any class actions against Google. Advertisers would now have to go through the expensive process of bringing individual arbitration to resolve disputes. The timing leaves little doubt that this was done in direct response to the WSJ article to prevent small and mid-size advertisers from suing and obtaining redress. Because of the far-reaching implications of these events, in December 2017, instead of just filing a claim for individual damages, we filed a class action lawsuit against Google. The case spurred some media attention but none of the articles published in Business Insider [5], The Register [6], AdExchanger[7], and other media outlets really captured the essence of the story. So, we decided to set the record straight. Moreover, we owe it to our publisher clients to finally share with them what had really happened. Since we did our best to cover their losses from Google, most of them were oblivious to the whole situation. Ironically, by protecting our publishers from Google\u2019s theft, we were simultaneously protecting Google\u2019s reputation. By being positioned on both sides of the Google Ad Exchange, we could easily check if the money was returned to the advertisers. On Friday, May 19 2017, we received an auto-generated email from the DoubleClick Ad Exchange team stating that our account had been disabled. No action was required from our side, no specific reason was given, and we were informed that all our earnings totaling 476,622.69 USD had been withheld and would be: It was not stated which of our publishers was in violation, nor what the violation was. No explanation was given as to why all earnings were withheld, as opposed to just the amount accrued by the publisher who allegedly violated the terms. It is also important to note that the traffic which generated those earnings had already passed Google\u2019s monthly audit and only 0.1% of it was marked as sub-quality\u200a\u2014\u200aan insignificant amount compared to industry averages. Our account was terminated on a Friday evening, without any prior notice, and right at the end of the payment cycle, shortly before our publishers were due to receive their earnings. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this is common practice in Google\u2019s policy for terminating publisher accounts. To understand what had gone wrong, we contacted some senior executives at Google. In a telephone call, one of those execs explained that our account was terminated due to a violation, the nature of which he did not know. He repeatedly stated that every single cent of our earnings had been refunded to the advertisers, and also stressed that even if we successfully appealed Google\u2019s decision to terminate our account, we would not receive any of the withheld funds back. This final revelation was so absurd that it prompted us to dig up everything we could about Google\u2019s policies for refunding advertisers. There was so much deliberate regulatory obfuscation that we dedicated an entire section of this post to demystifying the advertising refunds conundrum. But before we get to this, we shall first attempt to decipher the alleged policy breach. Strangely, no notifications of any violations were reported in our DoubleClick for Publishers account. More significantly, pretty much all of our publisher clients were still monetizing their inventory with Google, either through AdSense or their own AdX accounts. This was not only evident from the publishers\u2019 websites where Google ads continue to feature prominently, but was also confirmed by data from Google\u2019s own reporting system, showing that Google Ad Exchange continues to offer inventory from those publishers. This was peculiar since according to Google\u2019s policies, publishers whose AdX accounts have been disabled are not allowed any further participation in any of Google\u2019s monetization products. We began wondering whether there was, in fact, any violation at all. Google\u2019s compartmentalization of oversight has apparently resulted in little to no internal communication between the different departments in its ecosystem of products. So, what the Google execs on the publishing side had neglected was that AdTrader was one of few companies positioned on both sides of their ad exchange. Some of our bidding activity on behalf of advertisers was conducted through DBM and happened to be on sites under our AdX account. This meant that we could easily check if the money was, in fact, returned to the advertisers. This is precisely why Google rarely tolerates companies sitting on both sides of its ad exchange. It provides far too much transparency into the money flowing in and out of their platforms. After going through dozens of reports we started to connect the dots. Much to our surprise, according to records pulled from non-other but Google\u2019s own reporting system, no refunds or credits were issued to the advertisers. To verify this, we reached outside of our client portfolio and asked a few agencies and advertisers across different markets whether they had received any refunds from Google. They confirmed that they had not. The further we dug, the more evidence kept piling up. We briefly outline some of the main points below, for a more complete record please refer to the AdTrader v Google complaint [8]. Withholding publisher earnings and falsely claiming to return them to the advertisers is the very definition of theft. We started talking to lawyers and it quickly became clear that what we had uncovered so far extended beyond our personal claims. We continued collecting evidence that would eventually build up both our individual and a class action case. Allowing a partner to accumulate close to $0.5M of earnings, without any warning of improper practices, waiting right until the end of the payment cycle when the partner has generated the most amount of money, and then abruptly refusing to pay out any of those earnings by means of auto-generated e-mails is nothing short of evil. Withholding money from publishers and falsely claiming to return those funds to the affected advertisers, on the other hand, is the very definition of theft. With hundreds of thousands of publishers terminated each year [12], this potentially means billions of dollars of illegally appropriated funds that have never reached the advertisers. While Google is claiming to publishers that it cannot pay out their earnings as they have already been refunded to the advertisers, it is simultaneously claiming to advertisers that it is able to only refund a fraction of that amount (their platform fee) as the rest had been paid out to the publishers. If by now, some are still wondering why we are making this case public, instead of quietly pursuing our individual damages, this section aims to eliminate any confusion. Google has always claimed that it refunds or credits advertisers for any invalid traffic bought through their platforms: This and similar claims were repeatedly made in the Google Service Agreement, in the Google Advertising Program Terms, on multiple pages in its AdWords and AdSense Help Centre, as well as in our direct communication with the Google team. It was not until August 25 2017, that The Wall Street Journal made it publicly known [4] that Google did not give complete refunds or credits to its advertisers for what was determined by Google\u2019s own detection system to be invalid traffic. The WSJ had made this discovery independently from our case, but their findings were more or less pointing in the same direction. The article explained that instead of refunding advertiser the full amount, Google had only offered to refund their platform fee which would typically range between 7\u201310% of the total amount spent. Google insisted that this was appropriate because: \u201cthey don\u2019t control the rest of the money spent\u201d. The truth is, Google does control most of the money spent, as most of it is spent on its very own DoubleClick Ad Exchange. A simple report from DoubleClick Bid Manager would show that over 50% of the advertising revenue from the platform flows directly into Ad Exchange. Google themselves admit in their Ad Exchange Seller Help Centre [13] that most of the media buying from its own platforms AdWords and DoubleClick Bid Manager happens on Ad Exchange. Other industry experts such as Brian O\u2019Kelley, CEO of AppNexus, have also been vocal about Google giving an unfair advantage to their own ad exchange when allocating demand from their demand-side platform DoubleClick Bid Manager. In an interview with the AdExchanger [14], he states that: So, while Google is claiming to publishers that it cannot pay out their earnings as they have already been refunded to the advertisers, it is simultaneously claiming to advertisers that it is able to only refund a fraction of that amount (their platform fee) as the rest had been paid out to the publishers. Clearly, the two statements contradict each other and to further confuse matters, neither is entirely true. In reaction to an article by The Register [6] reporting on our lawsuit, a Google spokesperson admitted that Google only recently started to put a system in place for refunding its DBM advertisers: The announcement was made in September last year and according to our invoices, up until November, not a single refund was made to the advertisers. Given that Google has had over a decade to implement a refunding mechanism, we believe that the timing of this announcement is directly related to the WSJ article that came just weeks before. Looking back on all the inconsistencies, deliberate obfuscations, and blatant cover-ups, in our opinion, the most significant is the AdWords contract change, as it demonstrates abuse of power on a level that can hardly be neglected. Contractual relationships with millions of advertisers were summarily redacted in the blink of an eye. Not only is Google stealing money but it now has the legal safety net to continue to do so without risking any reprimands. Google uses and abuses its monopolistic power on the buy and sell side to profit at the expense of everyone using their platforms. As a platform, Google only has a pass-through authority. Any funds, outside of its platform fee, belong either to the advertisers or the publishers. By illegally appropriating earnings from its publishers and falsely claiming to have refunded them to the advertisers, Google is generating hidden profit margins that far exceed its revenue from platform fees. It is therefore reasonable to argue that Google came to be the largest advertising company in the world not merely on account of its search monopoly but equally so because of its overblown profit margins. AdTrader had to pay a steep price for trusting Google as a business partner, as we are sure many others also did. But was it not for this, we would not have uncovered the broader issue that affects not just us but the entire advertising community\u200a\u2014\u200athat Google uses and abuses its monopolistic power on the buy and sell side to profit at the expense of everyone using their platforms. By taking legal action, we hope to put an end to this. Google have to commit to being a platform with a pass-through authority. Anything outside of its platform fee either belongs to the publishers or to the advertisers. It is not Google\u2019s to keep. As for AdTrader, it was never our intention to get involved in a multi-year lawsuit with one of the most resourceful companies in the world. But what happened was beyond our control and we have to fight it back. We are doing so on two independent fronts\u200a\u2014\u200atechnological and legal. The former has been a work in progress for approximately three years now and we are working harder than ever on our new products. As for the latter, we have made sure that we can take this lawsuit to the very end and will do it in the best interest of all advertisers locked in Google\u2019s monopoly. We invite all affected DoubleClick Bid Manager and AdWords advertisers, agencies, and trading desks to come forward and join our class action lawsuit. Given Google\u2019s decision to change all its contracts, this might be our last chance to act and we cannot afford to miss it! Please get in touch with us because together we can get our voices heard and level the playing field.

We have raised $175 million, and will be sequentially initiating new businesses that use AI to improve human life. As we grow these businesses, we also hope to help many of you enter the field of AI, and do the important work of building an AI-powered society. We are grateful to our investors, including NEA, Sequoia, Greylock Partners, the SoftBank Group and others for supporting us. In the early days of electricity, much of the innovation centered around slightly different improvements in lighting. While this was an important foundation, the really transformative applications, in which electric power spurred massive redesigns in multiple industries, took longer to be grasped. AI is the new electricity, and is at a similar inflection point. When I was leading Baidu\u2019s AI Group, part of my job was serially building teams to explore new directions, and then systematically assessing their potential and deciding whether or not to go forward with specific AI businesses. In addition to being a lot of fun, it hammered home to me something that I\u2019d felt since the early days of Google Brain: that we can develop systematic and repeatable processes to initiate and pursue new AI opportunities. We are starting to see how AI will transform almost every industry. AI Fund teams are currently pursuing three new AI-powered directions, some of which we hope to announce later. As such projects mature and turn into businesses, the AI Fund will provide additional capital to these teams and thereby give them the ability to move quickly, and not be distracted by months of fundraising. A difference of six months can determine whether a new AI solution takes off or is too far behind to catch up, so we\u2019re setting up the AI Fund to let our teams move as quickly as possible. It also allows our teams to publicize their work only when they are ready. I had announced Landing.AI last month, which is focusing on using AI to transform manufacturing. The AI Fund is providing funding to Landing.AI, which will accelerate its growth. As with any societal transformation, the transition toward AI will be jarring for some. It is an urgent societal problem to address the impact of AI and automation on jobs. My team is continuing to invest heavily in global training programs. I want to make sure every person can gain the skills needed to thrive in the AI economy, and every person has a shot at meaningful work. I will be leading the AI Fund as its General Partner. Eva Wang will be Partner and COO, and Steven Syverud will also serve as Partner. Eva was formerly a partner at Fenwick & West, and will bring considerable operational and legal expertise to the fund, Steven had led the development of Coursera\u2019s Specializations product and was CEO of Sycamore, and will bring considerable product as well as business development expertise. If you work in AI, you have important work ahead. Just as the work of Thomas Edison had helped build an electric-powered society, it is now time to build an AI-powered society. The AI Fund will be working hard to accelerate this important global transformation. Andrew Ng By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

With this in mind, it is easy to understand what is Generative Adversarial Network. It is a kind of right hemisphere\u200a\u2014\u200athe one that is claimed to be responsible for creativity. The Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are the first step of neural networks technology learning creativity. Typical GAN is a neural network trained to generate images on the certain topic using an image dataset and some random noise as a seed. Up until now images created by GANs were of low quality and limited in resolution. Recent advances by NVIDIA showed that it is within a reach to generate photorealistic images in high-resolution and they published the technology itself in open-access. There is a plethora of GANs types of various complexity, architectures, and strange acronyms. We are mostly interested here in conditional GANs and variational autoencoders. Conditional GANs are capable of not just mimicking the broad type of images as \u201cbedroom\u201d, \u201cface\u201d, \u201cdog\u201d but also dive into more specific categories. For example, the Text2Image network is capable of translation textual image description into the image itself. By varying random seed that is concatenated to the \u201cmeanings\u201d vector we are able to produce an infinite number of birds image, matching description. Let\u2019s just close your eyes and see the world in 2 years. Companies like NVIDIA will push GAN technology to industry-ready level, same as they did with celebrities faces generation. This means, that a GAN will be able to generate any image, on-demand, on-the-fly based on textual (for example) description. This will render obsolete a number of photography and design related industries. Here\u2019s how this will work. Again, the network is able to generate an infinite number of images by varying random seed. And here\u2019s the scary part. Such a network can receive not only description of the target object it needs to generate, but also a vector describing you\u200a\u2014\u200athe ad consumer. This ad can have a very deep description of your personality, web browsing history, recent transactions, and geolocation, so the GAN will generate one-time, unique and, that fits you perfectly. CTR is going sky high. By measuring your reactions the network will adapt and make ads targeting you more and more precisely, hitting your soft spots. So, at the end of the day, we are going to see a fully personalized content everywhere on the Internet. Everyone will see fully custom versions of all content, that is adapted to the consumer based on his lifestyle, opinions, and history. We all witnessed arousal of this Bubble pattern after latest USA elections and it\u2019s gonna be getting worse. GANs will able to target content precisely to you with no limitations of the medium\u200a\u2014\u200astarting from image ads and up to complex opinions, tread and publications, generated by machines. This will create a constant feedback loop, improving based on your interactions. And there is going to be a competition of different GANs between each other. Kind of a fully automated war of phycological manipulations, having humanity as a battlefield. The driving force behind this trend is extremely simple\u200a\u2014\u200aprofits. And this is not a scary doomsday scenario, this actually is happening today. I have no idea. But surely we need few things: broad public discussions about this technology inevitable arrival and a backup plan to stop it. So, it\u2019s better to start thinking now\u200a\u2014\u200ahow we can fight this process and benefit from it at the same time. We are not there yet due to some technical limitation. Up until recently images generated by GANs were just of bad quality and easily spotted as fake. NVIDIA showed that it is actually doable to generate 1024x1024 extremely real faces. To move things forward we would need faster and bigger GPUs, more theoretical studies on GAN, more smart hacks around GAN training, more labeled datasets, etc. Please, notice\u200a\u2014\u200awe don\u2019t need new power sources, quantum processors (but they can help), general AI to reach this point or some other purely theoretical new cool things. All we need is within a reach of few years and likely big corp already have this kind of resources available. Also, we will need smarter neural networks. I am definitely looking for progress in capsules approach by Hinton et al. And of course, we will be the first to implement this in super-resolution technology, that should heavily benefit from GAN progress. Let me know what you think.

LaBerge, who is 66 years old, is the main attraction\u2014the reason we\u2019re all here. He\u2019s the founding father of the science of lucid dreaming. If you\u2019ve ever been aware that you are dreaming, but remained asleep, you\u2019ve experienced a lucid dream. Some people claim to have had one at least once, if only briefly\u2014usually just before waking up. With enough practice, say proponents like LaBerge, lucid dreamers can rescript their nightly narratives as they please. According to one recent study, the newly initiated most often use lucid dreams to satisfy sexual appetite or aeronautic fancy. The more experienced, though, claim to be able to create art or acquire skills in their dreams. It is not uncommon to hear testimonials stating that lucid dreaming \u201cchanged my life.\u201d LaBerge says one can choose to become lucid within a dream. Indeed, LaBerge claims to be an uncommonly prodigious lucid dreamer himself, having catalogued thousands of his own lucid dreams. He says it\u2019s a skill that can be cultivated. That\u2019s what two dozen or so paying customers, myself included, have come to Hawaii to learn. \u201cAre the fans too loud?\u201d LaBerge asks. \u201cWe can lower them if you can\u2019t hear.\u201d A warm breeze billows LaBerge\u2019s aloha shirt, printed with ferns in psychedelic swirls. He\u2019s barefoot, and a shock of white hair accents his weary blue eyes. LaBerge believes that lucid dreaming isn\u2019t just some quirk of consciousness\u2014it\u2019s a gateway to a broader theory of the conscious mind. So he\u2019s really waiting for an answer. What is reality? Anyone? THE VERY EXISTENCE OF LUCID DREAMS has been widely debated. According to prevailing theory, areas of the brain that generate self-reflection and govern rational thought throttle down as dreams start up. As our slumber deepens, we lose our short-term memory and self-awareness and, as a consequence, can\u2019t spot the non sequiturs that fill our dreams, or even locate the actual position of our bodies. Only in the cold light of day, when executive functions come back online, do we realize how outlandish our dream plots are. Lucid dreamers, by contrast, claim to be able to regain a host of daytime cognitive faculties while still dreaming. With enough practice, say proponents, people can redirect their dreams, and by so doing, at least according to LaBerge, transform their real-life narratives as well. When sleep scientists turned to the study of dreams in the 1950s, few considered the notion of lucid dreaming to be more than a curiosity. It was the province of occultists and parapsychologists. Not until LaBerge produced the first evidence for lucid dreams, during graduate work at Stanford University in the 1970s, did the topic gain a modicum of scientific respectability. His pioneering work was barely acknowledged in the decades that followed, but a new generation of dream researchers is now revisiting those early experiments with renewed respect and greater interest. A handful, some of whom trained under LaBerge and have adopted his methods, are discovering how lucid dreams function, what they can be used for, and why they may be scientifically significant. The study of lucid dreaming has broken out of the scientific fringe and is being taken seriously. And yet LaBerge is running retreats in Hawaii. Lucid dreaming is undergoing a resurgence, and it\u2019s happening without the man who started it all. The workshops, organized through LaBerge\u2019s Lucidity Institute of Palo Alto, began in 1995 on the Stanford campus and later moved to Hawaii. For around $2,500, you get eight days of lectures in the sun. The secluded Kalani retreat appears to be a haven for unconventional tourism. Nudists splash in the clothing-optional pool. On Sundays, dreadlocked bohemians frolic at \u201chippie church\u201d dances. The lucid dreamers\u2014LaBerge calls them \u201coneironauts,\u201d a neologism of his that means \u201cexplorers of the dream world\u201d\u2014fit right in, peppering their conversations with invocations of energy fields and alternative realities, as well as unabashed references to spirits, ghosts, and flying saucers. \u201cYears of interest in dreams, religious mysticism, reality, and related subjects all came together to provide a truly life-changing experience for me,\u201d wrote one attendee, in a testimonial for the Lucidity Institute\u2019s brochure. LaBerge says the workshops are a necessity because the institute serves as his primary source of research funding. Academic research grants dried up years ago. The workshops are the principle means by which LaBerge collects data for his studies: Attendees are experimental subjects as well as students. And LaBerge has attracted a significant following. His 1991 work, Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming, is in print and still selling. Movies like The Matrix and Inception have reportedly helped spread the word about lucid dreaming. There\u2019s also now a Reddit subgroup devoted to lucid dreams that has almost 100,000 members. Unfortunately, the arrangement alienates academic colleagues. LaBerge operates on \u201cthe fringe of the scientific community,\u201d says Deirdre Barrett, a psychologist at Harvard University and the past president of the International Association for the Study of Dreams. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s incompatible,\u201d she says, noting that he remains one of the foremost authorities on lucid dreaming. \u201cHis research is taken seriously in main sleep research circles, mostly, but with the sort of edgy-fringy controversial quality.\u201d I talked to some of the retreat attendees, and most weren\u2019t there as volunteers for a research project. They were looking for much more. Rachel, a lawyer, was enticed by \u201cthe possibility of changing my biology\u2014brain hacking. Maybe I can make myself a genius.\u201d Others talked about using lucid dreaming to find their \u201chigher self.\u201d A 35-year-old software developer from Colorado Springs named Matt Winzenried says he came to Hawaii to find the meaning of life. About four years ago, he told me, he fell into a deep funk. He felt stifled by an overbearing boss and lackluster job. One night, while lying in bed, he heard a scuffling noise. As it drew closer, he reached under his bed for a gun but found nothing. Then something clambered up the nightstand, and Winzenried saw a furry blue creature gnashing its teeth. \u201cThat\u2019s when I realized I was dreaming,\u201d he says. Unexpectedly, the insight put him at ease. He felt a wave of \u201ctotal acceptance and tranquility.\u201d Winzenried was able to take control of his dream, grab the monster, and in one deep, long breath, inhale all but the creature\u2019s skin deep into his own lungs. \u201cThere was nothing left except cloth,\u201d he says. He awoke feeling \u201cready to tackle the world.\u201d Winzenried says that first lucid dream turned his life around. He enrolled in a personal development workshop. He got promoted. He began taking lessons in hockey and art. He started a small business. He joined Toastmasters to confront his debilitating shyness and soon became club president. \u201cI was loving the way things were going,\u201d Winzenried says. \u201cBut I wondered, is it leading somewhere? What\u2019s my purpose?\u201d LaBerge\u2019s retreat, with its goal of directing waking and dreaming consciousness \u201ctoward fulfillment of personal goals,\u201d promised an answer. LABERGE DOESN\u2019T WANT TO BE a New Age icon. \u201cI always wanted to be a scientist,\u201d he insists. When he founded the institute, he says, \u201cit wasn\u2019t for doing deep psychotherapy.\u201d He was born\u2014or, rather, arrived \u201cfrom beyond the stars,\u201d as he likes to put it\u2014in 1947. As a child growing up in Florida, he was captivated by movie serials. One morning, he awoke from a dream in which he had imagined himself as a pirate. The dream was \u201cparticularly fun,\u201d he recalled, but he was still disappointed. Unlike one of his adventure matinees, he couldn\u2019t return the next night to the same dream to catch the next plot twist. Or could he? The next night, and the night after that, young Stephen somehow returned to the dream and was able to advance the plot. It would be decades before he understood what this meant. In 1976 LaBerge was 29 years old, living in Palo Alto, and working at a pharmaceutical company, having abandoned graduate studies in chemical physics at Stanford. He later told an interviewer that he spent that period looking for \u201cthe holy grail of hippiedom.\u201d In other words, he was exploring the basis of consciousness with the help of psychedelic drugs. That fall he spotted a book at the Palo Alto Public Library with an intriguing title: Lucid Dreams. The author, Celia Green, was the founding director of the Institute of Psychophysical Research, which concerned itself mainly with extrasensory perception and other parapsychological phenomena. Green described the long history of self-experimentation into lucid dreaming, which began in the early-19th century, when French orientalist Marquis Hervey de Saint-Denys began looking into his own dreams. As a teenager, he noticed himself \u201cdeveloping a faculty,\u201d as he put it, of becoming aware that he was dreaming while still in the dream. He published an anonymous account, Dreams and the Means to Direct Them, in 1867. Thirty years later, Dutch psychiatrist Frederik Willem van Eeden collected some 352 dreams involving \u201creintegration of the psychic functions,\u201d such as access to waking memory and volition. He called them \u201clucid dreams,\u201d derived from the psychiatric term \u201clucid interval,\u201d meaning a moment of clarity amid madness. The response was harsh; Havelock Ellis, the British physician and psychologist, said of these dreams, \u201cI do not believe that such a thing is really possible.\u201d After reading Green\u2019s book, LaBerge had several dramatic lucid dreams, which convinced him to resume graduate studies at Stanford, this time in the nascent interdisciplinary field of psychophysiology. There, LaBerge won approval to conduct his dissertation research on lucid dreaming. Though, at the time, the scientific community was not so sure this was an area worthy of study. FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE 20TH CENTURY, scientists believed that the sleeping brain was completely at rest. But in 1953, Nathaniel Kleitman, a University of Chicago physiologist, detected eye movements in sleeping subjects, and showed that the movements correlated with subjective reports of dreaming. He had made the field\u2019s most significant discovery to date: the identification of rapid eye movement sleep, or REM, as the time when most vivid dreams occur. A few years later, William Dement, a doctoral student of Kleitman\u2019s, observed that these eye movements were not always random. Subjects\u2019 eyes moved up and down while they dreamed of shooting baskets, or shifted side to side while they dreamed of, in one case, watching people throw tomatoes at each other. Dement\u2019s findings, criticized at the time, were later borne out. In 1970, at Stanford, he opened the first sleep lab anywhere. A few years later, LaBerge asked to Dement to be his doctoral adviser. Dement took an immediate liking to the young man. \u201cWhat I can say without any ambiguity whatsoever,\u201d recalls Dement, now one of the nation\u2019s leading sleep scientists, \u201cis that I was excited by his proposal. I supported it enthusiastically and financially, and I\u2019ve been a fan of his ever since.\u201d It was Dement\u2019s dream scanning hypothesis\u2014looking around in a dream corresponds with actual physical eye movements\u2014that gave LaBerge a pivotal idea: maybe people could use eye movements to communicate from within a dream. Before subjects went to sleep, he could instruct them to signal their lucidity by shifting their gaze in a prearranged pattern in the dream. If successful, the pattern would appear as a distinctive pattern in the electrical signals recorded from the subject\u2019s eyes, muscles, and brain. To those in the lab, the message would be clear: the subject had awakened inside a dream. On January 13th, 1978, in the dim lab at the Stanford University Sleep Center, LaBerge became his own first experimental subject. He went to sleep tethered to an assemblage of electrical recording equipment and, toward the end of the night, found himself in a vast emptiness. He couldn\u2019t see, feel, or hear anything, which prompted the realization that he was dreaming. Then, as he described in Lucid Dreaming, a mysterious instruction manual\u2014\u201cfor a vacuum cleaner or some such appliance\u201d\u2014drifted into view. He strained to read it. He felt his eyes open. His hands began to tingle. The rest of his body materialized. He was lying on a bed, in a room much like the sleep lab. \u201cSince I now had a dream body I decided to do the eye movements that we had agreed upon,\u201d LaBerge later wrote. He traced a pattern with his finger to help direct his gaze through the prearranged signal: look up, look down, then up, then down again. After waking, LaBerge checked the polysomnographic readings. Examining the moments just before his last REM period ended, he spotted \u201ctwo large eye movements\u201d that resembled the up-down-up-down signal. This, he thought, was possible proof of a lucid dream arising from REM sleep. It was a start. Over the course of a total of 20 recording sessions, LaBerge documented 14 more lucid dreams, a number of them in his own home, where he had installed equipment to monitor his electrical activity at night, along with a tape recorder to record the data on magnetic tape. At home, there was no research supervision. \u201cIn some cases, I put the electrodes on myself,\u201d he says. At the end of the experiment, LaBerge\u2019s self-reported results were compiled along with the polysomnographic readings, and an impartial judge was called in to make comparisons. In nearly every pairing, a distinct pattern of movements emerged during REM: left, left, left, followed by left, right, left, left. Translated into Morse code, the pattern read: dot, dot, dot, then dot, dash, dot, dot\u2014or \u201cSL,\u201d for Stephen LaBerge. Eventually, LaBerge recruited four other subjects for his pilot study: two men and two women, who each spent three or four nights at the Stanford sleep lab and recorded ten lucid dreams between them. Then he wrote up his findings in a scientific paper, \u201cLucid Dreaming Verified by Volitional Communication During REM Sleep,\u201d claiming \u201ca new approach to dream research.\u201d Lucid dreamers, he wrote, \u201ccould carry out diverse dream experiments,\u201d using eye signals to alert lab technicians not only to lucidity but also to actual dream content. There would be one signal, say, for savoring a dream steak, another for solving a dream equation, and another for seducing a dream mate. These could be correlated with activity in the brain and the body. LaBerge believed this would be a way to bridge the worlds of waking and dreaming, to perform what he calls \u201ctrans-reality\u201d communication. For months, LaBerge struggled to get the paper published. One reviewer for Science found it \u201cdifficult to imagine subjects simultaneously both dreaming their dreams and signaling them to others.\u201d Nature sent it back without comment. It didn\u2019t help that the majority of the lucid dreams had been provided by LaBerge himself. Finally, the paper was published in 1981 in an obscure journal, Perceptual and Motor Skills, where it landed with a dull thud. Few sleep scientists can recall its publication. In the years that followed, LaBerge did occasionally get the approbation he sought. Around the time his paper was published, for instance, LaBerge presented further data at a sleep conference\u2014data that Robert Van de Castle, director of the sleep lab at the University of Virginia Medical School, described as making a firm case \u201cfor the existence of lucid dreaming under controlled laboratory conditions.\u201d But LaBerge more often faced skepticism. If lucid dreamers could access waking faculties\u2014memory, volition, even motor skills\u2014then in what sense were they really asleep, asked one sleep scientist. Perhaps lucid dreams were really brief \u201cmicro\u201d awakenings, something quite apart from REM sleep. Ernest Hartmann, a doctor at the Sleep Disorders Center at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Massachusetts, insisted that the dreamers must have woken up the moment they became lucid. Perhaps the eye movements had been accidental, some critics suggested. Or the subjects had fabricated their reports. Despite professional doubts, lucid dreaming was catching on with the general public. In 1987 LaBerge founded a private research organization of his own\u2014the Lucidity Institute. The business plan was built on a benevolent spiral of good will. The institute would conduct workshops on lucid dreaming, the fees from which would support research that would be conducted on workshop attendees. The research findings would, in turn, raise the institute\u2019s profile, which would allow it to conduct more workshops and support more research. The institute also sold LaBerge\u2019s lucid-dream induction devices, such as the DreamLight, the DreamLink, and the NovaDreamer, which retailed for up to $1,200. LaBerge\u2019s popular profile grew\u2014the Los Angeles Times dubbed him America\u2019s \u201cDr. Dreams\u201d\u2014but over the next fifteen years, his reputation in the scientific community unraveled. He bounced around labs as a research associate\u2014first in Dement\u2019s psychiatry lab from 1984 to 1991, then in Philip Zimbardo\u2019s psychology lab (of the infamous Stanford prison study) through 2003. He never got a permanent position, and as grant money was diverted away from basic research and toward clinical research on sleep disorders, his own research team consisted mostly of student volunteers, and his lab access was restricted to times when more lucrative projects were not underway. LaBerge\u2019s interests drifted further afield. He undertook wholly fringe explorations into out-of-body experiences, Tibetan dream yoga, and telekinesis. \u201cIt was definitely not like the other sleep research being done,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI\u2019m sure I was a problem.\u201d LaBerge had a \u201chard time getting money,\u201d Dement recalls, even to cover minimal compensation for subjects and basic salaries for technicians. As his academic career evaporated and the field of academic inquiry into lucid dreams tapered off, the Lucidity Institute assumed greater significance. \u201cBy the 1980s, we were the only ones doing this research, and without funding,\u201d he says. \u201cBut this was my vision. I couldn\u2019t abandon my baby.\u201d THE TRUMPETING OF A CONCH SHELL woke us up at 7:30 am. Breakfast was scrambled tofu and granola. The murmuring to each other about last night\u2019s sleep\u2014\u201cAny lucid dreams?\u201d\u2014made clear that the dreaming, sadly, had been of the ordinary sort. We formed a semi-circle, some reclining in cottage wicker chairs, others slinking to the floor, literally at LaBerge\u2019s bare feet. \u201cGood morning,\u201d he said with a broad smile. Sensing our mood, he quickly added, \u201cMaybe.\u201d LaBerge is very intense. As he lectures, he fidgets. He crosses and re-crosses his legs, interlocks his fingers one way and then another, shifts his weight in the chair. His nervousness is tied to his introverted nature, which he had to overcome to run the workshops. He sweated as he talked to us, and his wife, Lynne Levitan, smoothed his hair into place and dabbed his face with paper towel. He associates lucid dreaming, in fact, with his own anxiety. In the late 70s, he told us, he frequently became lucid in dreams that involved anxious situations. \u201cIt might be the police. I was a hippie in those days, an outlaw, and the police were always stopping me. So there was a background of paranoia.\u201d The classroom was cluttered with tchotchkes, which included a blue rubber robot holding a sign that read, \u201cIS THIS A DREAM?\u201d LaBerge invited us to check on our perceptions. He trained us to constantly assess our current reality, searching for signs that something is amiss, so we\u2019d get in the habit of doing reality checks in our dreams. All week, the line between waking and dreaming was blurred. \u201cIn the waking state, we are clearly influenced by the physical energies, whatever those may be,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the dream state, it\u2019s a relatively pure culture, where nothing is left but my mind.\u201d He presented the two realities as a choice between the blue pill (\u201cyou wake up and believe anything you want\u201d) and the red pill (\u201cyou stay in wonderland\u201d). His own choice was clear. IN EARLY SEPTEMBER 2001, the German Society of Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine held its annual meeting in Hamburg. Allan Hobson, a Harvard psychiatrist and director of the Laboratory of Neurophysiology at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center, was a speaker. Hobson championed the view that dreams themselves mean very little. Perhaps the act of dreaming serves some biological function, he said, but their content is just a meaningless by-product\u2014an epiphenomenon, like steam from a pot of boiling water. All of which made it more than a little surprising to a young scientist named Ursula Voss when Hobson approached her with this proposal: study lucid dreams. Voss was an experimental psychologist at Bonn University who spent her early career studying states of consciousness, especially the moments between sleeping and waking. To her, lucid dreams belonged in the realm of \u201cesoteric mysticism.\u201d She was convinced, as LaBerge\u2019s critics had been, that sleeping subjects who gained control over their eyes must, in fact, be awake. Hobson was insistent, she said. He told Voss that the study of lucid dreaming might help illuminate the neural basis of consciousness. But he warned her to approach LaBerge\u2019s work with caution, since he believed that the spiritual side of lucid dreaming was a distraction. \u201cHe\u2019s a nice guy,\u201d Hobson said of LaBerge, \u201cbut he missed the point entirely.\u201d Still, Hobson believed the early work was valuable. Lucid dreaming, he told Voss, offered a window onto a sequestered mind brimming with thoughts and feelings and unconstrained by the outside world. When she returned to Bonn, Voss summoned two colleagues and told them about the \u201ccrazy study\u201d upon which they were about to embark. \u201cI was actually afraid this would kill my career,\u201d Voss told me. So she approached Hobson\u2019s challenge at first as a skeptic. \u201cI set out to prove him wrong.\u201d The early work was tedious, partly because lucid dreamers are hard to find. Surveys suggest that as many as half of us will experience a lucid dream once, but far fewer people have them regularly. And it seems likely that only a tiny fraction\u2014just one percent of respondents, according to one study\u2014can become lucid at will. After interviewing dozens of undergraduates, Voss\u2019s team recruited 20 who claimed to have had lucid dreams at least twice a week. Before falling asleep each night, the students were instructed to set their intention to become lucid. This autosuggestion was not very effective, but by the end of the four-month training period, six subjects reported lucid dreams somewhat regularly. Those six, deemed \u201cpromising\u201d, were brought to Frankfurt University Hospital, an hour and a half away, where they could be observed overnight. Over the next several months, Voss and her colleagues spent weeks at a time in the Frankfurt sleep lab. First, they used MRI technology to scan the sleepers\u2019 brains, but the noise produced by the devices kept waking the subjects. Then they resorted to measuring electrical activity alone. They employed LaBerge\u2019s eye-signaling method, but had little luck; the signals appeared even when the sleeping subjects were not lucid. Yet the subjects still generated a handful of confirmed lucid dreams\u2014three between them. And when the German team examined the data, what they saw was startling. In the early morning hours, as the sleeping subjects became lucid, the dreamers\u2019 frontal lobes became active\u2014an indication that the subjects were regaining the ability to self-reflect, rationalize, and access short-term memory. This alone might have suggested the subjects were simply waking up, but other areas of the brain that are ramped down during dreaming, notably the parietal lobe, which during the day sorts sensory information streaming in from the external world, remained inactive. \u201cOur data show that lucid dreaming constitutes a hybrid state of consciousness, with definable and measurable differences from waking and from REM sleep,\u201d Voss concluded in a 2009 paper in Sleep. \u201cArguably the most important empirical study on dreaming of the year,\u201d declared Valdas Noreika of the Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Turku, in Finland. Hobson, who co-authored the Sleep paper, could hardly contain himself, writing that the \u201cearthshaking\u201d study could move lucid dreaming \u201cfrom its marginal and tenuous place at the fringe of psychophysiology to center stage in the emerging science of consciousness.\u201d The decades-long controversy about whether lucid dreamers were awake or asleep was officially over, he declared. \u201cLaBerge and his critics were wrong,\u201d Hobson told me. \u201cThey said it\u2019s either one thing or the other. And none of them said it is both.\u201d Voss herself is more circumspect. Lucid dreaming is unusual and unstable, she insists, perhaps only \u201can exception, an accident.\u201d She grants that regular dreaming may serve some critical biological function\u2014nightly information processing, say, or bodily temperature control. But lucid dreaming \u201cis not meant to be.\u201d In a more ruminative moment, Voss confessed that lucid dreams might offer a privileged view into the evolution of consciousness in the brain: progressing from the primitive activity of \u201ca cold-blooded animal\u201d during non-REM sleep, to the sparks of real cognition of \u201ca rabbit or cat\u201d during regular dreaming, to the peak of self-awareness, reasoning, and memory during lucid dreaming, in which the dreamer at last possesses \u201ca human brain, a higher-order conscious brain.\u201d VOSS\u2019S STUDY WENT SOME WAY to redeeming LaBerge\u2019s reputation, but succeeded only in enraging the man himself. He wrote a merciless appraisal in the International Journal of Dream Research, and, when we discussed the study, he noted that the authors had never experienced the kind of dream they were studying. For many scientists that might not seem like a bad thing, but LaBerge was dismissive. \u201cThe study of consciousness is a little different from studies of other topics,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe have an inside view that can inform our research.\u201d Referring to lucid dreaming as a hybrid state, added LaBerge, is a logical fallacy. To him, lucid dreamers are achieving the full potential of the dream state, not leaving it for a hybrid one. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying that because most mammals don\u2019t fly, then the only explanation for bats is that they are \u2018hybrid bird-rats.\u2019\u201d LaBerge\u2019s complaints might stem partly from bitterness at no longer being at the center of the field he created. But he\u2019s not the only sleep scientist to find fault with Voss\u2019s work. \u201cI actually thought the Voss study might be overstating it a bit, even in terms of their own findings,\u201d says Deirdre Barrett. \u201cIf you had to call it a state, it\u2019s pretty powerfully more like REM.\u201d She thinks of the work done by Voss and Hobson as essentially \u201ca good update\u201d of LaBerge\u2019s original studies. Still, researchers continue to explore lucid dreams. Pilot studies on athletic performance have produced intriguing results: a snowboarder and spring-board diver who practiced their disciplines in lucid dreams, while slowing time to allow for better attention to detail, reported improvements in real life. A 2011 study in the Journal of Traumatic Stress suggested that lucid dreamers may become more resilient to trauma (exposure to terrorism, in this case), and therapists have reported experimenting with lucid-dreaming therapies to treat chronic nightmares. These are preliminary results\u2014but they hint at possible applications. Exactly what happens in the brains of lucid dreamers is also coming into sharper focus. Last year, Martin Dresler of the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich conducted a proof-of-concept study using functional MRI (fMRI), a sensitive brain-scanning technology, to examine lucid dreams. Dresler began by recruiting four people with lucid dreaming experience, and teaching them the eye signal. Then he monitored them with electrical recording equipment and an fMRI machine, for 15 nights. One subject managed to sleep deeply enough to have two confirmed lucid dreams, and the recordings backed up Voss\u2019s paper. As Dresler wrote in Sleep in 2012, \u201clucid dreaming was associated with a reactivation of several areas normally deactivated during REM sleep.\u201d Significantly, this reactivation occurred in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the precuneus\u2014the seats of higher cognition. The new researchers owe a huge debt to LaBerge: without his eye-signaling technique they could not verify lucid dreams objectively. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any argument about whether these [subjects] may be imagining it and [be] wide awake,\u201d says Barrett. \u201cI think that Stephen\u2019s first experiments really established that that\u2019s not the case.\u201d There may be controversy over the particulars of lucid dreaming, she added, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s really saying it doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d Still, LaBerge has never heard directly from Voss or Hobson. A statement by Hobson might explain why: \u201cIn order to be respected as serious scientists, we need to create a united front and concern ourselves about our credibility with workers in the mainstream of cognitive neuroscience,\u201d he wrote in 2010. \u201cWe must eschew any and all mystical or hucksterish trappings in order not to be seen as a deviant cult, which must remain marginalized.\u201d WHILE DRESLER AND OTHERS ARE USING expensive imaging equipment to study lucid dreams, one of LaBerge\u2019s latest projects is to validate the NovaDreamer, a device he patented in 1996 to stimulate lucid dreaming, and which he hopes to start selling again. The steampunk contraption of tangled wires and cryptic dials is designed as a sleep mask. Its built-in sensors detect REM sleep, at which point LEDs flash low-level light through the sleeper\u2019s eyelids. The flashing should turn up in some scene\u2014perhaps as police sirens, or bolts of lightning, or even, as one workshop attendee found, the sudden fogging up of an inexplicable pair of ski goggles while riding public transportation\u2014and the dreamer should realize it\u2019s the NovaDreamer and become lucid. During the Kalani workshop, the NovaDreamer hardly cued lucidity; mostly it was simply infuriating. At LaBerge\u2019s insistence we strapped it on whenever we climbed into bed. Each morning, when we assembled in the classroom to report our nocturnal happenings, we cursed the awkward headgear or the bright flashes for having rudely awoken us, or even for having prevented us from falling asleep. \u201cIt takes some getting used to,\u201d LaBerge would assure us as he collected the NovaDreamer recordings. At one point, he mentioned the NovaDreamer\u2019s light flashes generated by the NovaDreamer, and at that moment, a halogen bulb directly above his head mysteriously started to flicker. Perhaps a cue, from the NovaDreamer itself, to become lucid? For a few seconds, a murmur rippled through the classroom, as people checked to make sure they weren\u2019t dreaming and the device wasn\u2019t signaling to them. There was also, during the workshop, an experiment with galantamine, a prescription drug used to treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease, to see if it would spark lucid dreaming. Kristen LaMarca, LaBerge\u2019s assistant, was responsible for distributing the pills, which came in the form of an over-the-counter herbal supplement that contained low levels of the drug. It\u2019s not clear what, if anything, LaBerge will do with the data from this experiment and the NovaDreamer and the many dreams he has catalogued during the years he has run retreats. He hasn\u2019t gotten around to analyzing all his results, let alone publishing it. His appearances in peer-reviewed journals are infrequent. LaMarca, who recently earned a doctorate in clinical psychology with a focus on lucid dreaming from the California School of Professional Psychology, has grown impatient. \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t it been analyzed?\u201d she asked LaBerge during the retreat. He didn\u2019t have a good answer. There was not enough time, he said, and not enough money. A former research assistant of LaBerge\u2019s, whom I spoke to after the retreat, told me that \u201cthis knowledge will be buried forever in his garage.\u201d On the last full day of his workshop, LaBerge took us on a field trip to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. We gathered at the park\u2019s panoramic viewing area. Kilauea, the island\u2019s most active volcano, was smoldering. After a few group photos, we hiked along the lush paths, winding our way down to the lava tubes. \u201cThis way into the unconscious,\u201d LaBerge intoned. As we descended into the catacombs, a low rumbling sound reverberated off the walls of cooled lava. Ommmmmm. It was LaBerge, chanting the first syllable of a mantra.

I\u2019m 16 and I built my own VR headset with my best friends, Jonas Ceccon and Gabriel Combe. And it ended up costing us $100. I started programming when I was 13, thanks to my math teacher. Every Monday and Tuesday, my friends and I used to go to his classroom to learn and practice instead of having a meal at the cafeteria. I spent one year building a very basic 8-bit OS from scratch and competing in robotics contests with my friends. I then got interested in VR and with my friends we agreed that it would be really cool to create our own world in VR where we could spend time after school. But facing the fact that an Oculus was $700 at the time, we decided to build our own headset. It was because of an anime called Sword Art Online where the main character is in a virtual reality RPG that I fell in love with VR. I wanted to understand every aspect of it. I bought the cheapest components I could and we started by learning the very basics of the physics and math behind VR (proper acceleration, antiderivatives, quaternions\u2026). And then we re-invented VR. I wrote WRMHL, and then FastVR with Gabriel. Putting all of this together, we ended up with a $100 VR headset. To speed up VR development time, we built FastVR, an open-source SDK for developers that is easy to understand and customize. It works like this: Everything you need to build the headset has been open-sourced and can be hacked. I want to make VR mainstream. So I reached out to Oussama Ammar, one of the co-founders at The Family. I talked to him about setting up a company and launching a Kickstarter. But he convinced me that for now, it\u2019s better to wait on starting a business, to keep meeting others who have the same goals, and to keep learning. We took a trip to Silicon Valley and Oussama introduced me to the chief architect at Oculus, Atman Brinstock. And they gave me some precious advice: make all of this open source. There are still a lot of technical points that we want to improve. Our big focus right now is on a standalone VR headset, which we already have as a simple version, and cheaper 3D tracking. All of this will be released soon. If you want to learn more about the technical side and build your headset, just follow the guide by clicking here. Star the repo if you liked it \u2b50\ufe0f I would love to hear about what you\u2019ve experienced while building the headset, or if you need any help or have any questions.

They are attachment, or infatuation, or flirtation\u200a\u2014\u200aor something just being nice. Here\u2019s a breakdown of how it looks across a series of emotions, lukewarm to love. Here\u2019s normal stuff that normal people do\u200a\u2014\u200aand should do\u200a\u2014\u200aeven with strangers. It doesn\u2019t even mean they necessarily like you as a person\u200a\u2014\u200athey might just be polite. Especially in the south. None of these are signs of someone liking you. This is just normal human being stuff, guys. Congrats, they socialize well and you probably do too. Again, these aren\u2019t love. Tiffany Sun just wrote a great post on this\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cthings I wish guys didn\u2019t take as a mixed signal.\u201d But don\u2019t necessarily love you. And not only not you, but often in a way that\u2019s harmful to you, not genuine self-care. i.e., things people do \u201cfor others\u201d that are really for them. i.e., a prerequisite to being able to love someone else. Regardless of any of the above. Way too many people worry about being \u201cfriend-zoned.\u201d This is a misplaced concern. It\u2019s a lot easier to transition a friendship into romance than to wring romantic feelings out of not even liking each other as people. The bigger concern\u200a\u2014\u200aand what\u2019s really happening for a lot of frustrated daters\u200a\u2014\u200ais that they barely even like you as a person. They don\u2019t care about your goals, your values, your fears, or your love language. The big one is if they have a checklist of qualities they wanted in a partner and you happen to hit them. Or they have a list of stuff they\u2019ve always wanted to do with \u201csomeone,\u201d and now you\u2019re working your way through it together. When asked what they like about you, they list different things than how you value yourself (especially if the first one is superficial, like looks.) They adapted very little to \u201caccommodate\u201d you into their lives, and if you disappeared tomorrow, they\u2019d just go on living exactly the same way they always have. They make you laugh only because they get off on \u201cbeing funny.\u201d They invite you on their trip because they just really want someone to travel with. They share books and music and film and restaurant suggestions because they just get off on sharing or being in the know\u200a\u2014\u200aor they need for you to like the same things\u200a\u2014\u200anot because they care about your opinion. Or they do nice gestures just because they have a deep need to feel \u201cappreciated\u201d and influence over your happiness. Somehow nothing is ever for them to own\u200a\u2014\u200aand they don\u2019t want to. Their primary reaction is always to defend themselves, and they\u2019re never to blame. I don\u2019t mean the occasional drifting. I mean a general, persistent feeling of \u201cawayness.\u201d One day they\u2019re whispering sweet nothings in your ear, and then they go missing for two weeks. Like \u201cbeautiful.\u201d They still make long-term plans without discussing it with you. They still propose weekend plans by saying \u201cthat\u2019s where I\u2019ll be if you wanna come.\u201d Their ask about your day in a way that\u2019s half-hearted. They barely care about your struggles, and rarely share your celebrations. They care about you and your wellbeing separate from themselves and their own. Nobody can love without self-love. People without self-love will be seemingly \u201cgenerous\u201d and \u201cself-less\u201d but are actually using generosity to mask their deep-seated insecurity and need to build their self esteem around others emotional dependence on them. They love you if they never check in on you loving them back. They love you if the energy is truly give, not give and \u201cnow-where\u2019s-my-love-or-appreciation-back\u201d take. Without strings attached. When they\u2019re invested in deeply understanding you. And they go out of their way to make you happy. They rearrange their lives to fit you in. People love themselves and their own lives, so if they start forgoing any of that to be with you, that\u2019s a good sign. It doesn\u2019t have to be all their free time. It doesn\u2019t even have to be every day. And it certainly doesn\u2019t have to be as much as you want, if your idea of \u201cenough time\u201d is higher than theirs. But they do prioritize you. When you\u2019re together, you\u2019re together. They aren\u2019t zoning out or interrupting while you\u2019re talking, or eager for a distraction. Their mind is on the moment. They use words. It may not be the three words you want most to hear, but there will be communication. They\u2019re supportive of whatever is most important to you. Especially their future plans. Your pain is their pain. Your happiness is their happiness. Your day is their day. Your aspirations are theirs, too. Theirs as well as your own. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.
